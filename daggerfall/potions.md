# Potion Recipes

Elixirs, those indispensable essences of existence, doth play a vital role in Daggerfall's cruel embrace. At times, these elixirs may be plucked from the grasp of vanquished foes, or discovered amongst treasures concealed in dungeons throughout the land. Yet, most readily, they may be procured through purse or pouch, from the sacred halls of Iliac Bay's Temples or from the enigmatic Dark Brotherhood. 

Nay, thou canst also craft thy own elixirs, with the guiding hand of a Potion Maker ensconced within the Temple's sanctum or through shadowy alliances with the enigmatic Brotherhood. Unlike later Scrolls of Elders, alchemists here ply not their wares for sale, nor do they covet the flasks of concoction.

Herein, a roster of all elixirs within thy reach, alongside the herbs and alchemical quintessence requisite for their fabrication. Their virtues, however, remain veiled in secrecy.

Take heed: in the realm of Daggerfall Unity, any elixir imbued with the element of "chance" shall have its fickle hand set at one hundred percent, banishing the specter of failure, a feat most extraordinary.
