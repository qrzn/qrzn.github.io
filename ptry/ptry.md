# Poetry

Here are a few poems I've written so far when I had the inspiration. Most of them are written in German, although sometimes I write them in English or Latin. There are many more than on this page, I'll have to browse my physical notebooks, so expect updates from time to time.

### German

* [Ankh](/ptry/posts/ankh.html)
* [Der gewundene Pfad](/ptry/posts/dergewundenepfad.html)
* [Morgens](/ptry/posts/morgens.html)
* [Natur und Stadt](/ptry/posts/naturundstadt.html)
* [Ode an Silenus](/ptry/posts/odeansilenus.html)
* [Die Spechtschmiede](/ptry/posts/spechtschmiede.html)

### English

* [wizard's tower](/ptry/posts/wizardstower.html)
