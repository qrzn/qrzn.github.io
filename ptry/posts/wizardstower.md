### wizards'tower

shrouded in mystery in his antient wizards' tower  
sits the mighty sage, meditating upon his power  
how did he came to be?  
what exactly did he see?  
which forgotten books he read?  
that he into the tower fled?  
hath he answered all his queries?  
without being tormented by being weary  
his eyes gazing into the crystal ball  
in his hand the coins of yi and tarot fall  
the cards are mixed, the coins are shaken  
and with his will even lives are taken  
the dark arts he has studied but forsaken  
now he is the manifestation of light  
but his body is affected with the blight  
this is the curse of dagoth ur  
heinous creature dwelling in a shabby yurt  
unlike our greatest wizard in his tower  
we appraise thy power glourious mage!  
mix us a potion with thy love and sage.
