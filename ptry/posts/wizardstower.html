<h3 id="wizardstower">wizards’tower</h3>
<p>shrouded in mystery in his antient wizards’ tower<br />
sits the mighty sage, meditating upon his power<br />
how did he came to be?<br />
what exactly did he see?<br />
which forgotten books he read?<br />
that he into the tower fled?<br />
hath he answered all his queries?<br />
without being tormented by being weary<br />
his eyes gazing into the crystal ball<br />
in his hand the coins of yi and tarot fall<br />
the cards are mixed, the coins are shaken<br />
and with his will even lives are taken<br />
the dark arts he has studied but forsaken<br />
now he is the manifestation of light<br />
but his body is affected with the blight<br />
this is the curse of dagoth ur<br />
heinous creature dwelling in a shabby yurt<br />
unlike our greatest wizard in his tower<br />
we appraise thy power glourious mage!<br />
mix us a potion with thy love and sage.</p>
