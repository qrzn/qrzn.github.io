From Sicily and from Arcady ! Roaming as Racchus, with fauns and pards
And nymphs and satyrs for thy gnards, On a milk-white ass, corne over
the sea To me, to me, Corne with Apollo in hridal dress (Shepherdess and
pythoness) Come with Artemis, silken shod, And wash thy white thigh,
beautiful God, In the moon of the woods, on the marble mount, The
dimpled dawn of the amber fount! Dip the purple of passionate prayer In
the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare, The soul that startles in eyes of
blue To watch thy wantonness weeping through The tangled grove, the
gnarléd hole Of the living tree that is spirit and soul And body and
brain — come over the sea, (Io Pan! Io Pan!) Devil or god, to me, to me,
My man ! my man ! Come with trumpets sounding sbrill Over the hill !
Corne with drums low muttering From the spring! Come with flûte and

air that hath no boughs to nestle My body, weary of empty clasp, Strong
as a lion and sharp as an asp — Corne, O corne! I am numb With the
lonely lust of devildom. Thrust the sword through the galling fetter,
All-devourer, all-begetter; Give me the sign of the Open Eye, And the

Io Pan! lo Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan Pan! Pan, I am a man: Do as thou wilt,

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>E&lt;r&lt;7£ai àôàvaToç OeSç, 7.u^pozoç y oux tzi 0&amp;gt;rjz6ç</p>
<p><em>Pythagoras.</em></p>
<p>“Magic is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of
Natural Philosophy, advanced in its Works and wonderful operations by a
right understanding of the inward and occult virtue of things; so that
true Agents being applied to proper Patients, strange and admirable
effects will thereby be produced. Whence magicians are profound and
diligent searchers into Nature j they, because of their skill, know how
to anticipate an effect, the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a
miracle.”</p>
<p><em>The Goetia of the Lemegeton of King Solomon.</em></p>
<p>“Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its pure unadulterated form, it
is assumed that in nature one event follows another necessarily and
invariably without the intervention of any spiritual or personal
agency.</p>
<p><strong>Thus its fundamental conception is identical with that of
modem science; underlying the whole System is a faith, implicit but real
and firm, in the order and uniformity of nature.</strong> The magician
does not doubt that the same causes will always produce the same
effects, that the performance of the proper ceremony accompanied by the
appropriate spell, will inevitably be attended by the desired results,
unless, indeed, his incantations should chance to be thwarted and foiled
by the more potent charms of another sorcerer. He supplicates no higher
power: he sues the favour of no fickle and wayward being: he abases
himself before no awful deity. Yet his power, great as he believes it to
be, is by no means arbitrary and unlimited. He can wield it only so long
as he strictly conforms to the rules of his art, or to what may be
called the laws of nature as conceived by him. To neglect these rules,
to break these laws in the smallest particular is to incur failure, and
may even expose the unskilful practitioner himself to the utmost peril.
If he claims a sovereignty over nature, it is a constitutional
sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised in exact
conformity with ancient usage. <strong>Thus the analogy between the
magical and the scientific conceptions of the worid is close. In both of
them the succession of events is perfectly regular and certain, being
determined by immutable laws, the operation of which can be foreseen and
calculated precisely;</strong> the elements of caprice, of chance, and
of accident are banished from the course of nature. Both of them open up
a seemingly boundless vista of possibilities to him who knows the causes
of things and can touch the secret springs that set in motion the vast
and intncate mechanism of the worid. Hence the strong attraction which
magic and science alike have exercised on the human mind hence the
powerful stimulus that both have given to the pursuit of knowledge. They
lure the weary enquirer, the footsore seeker, on through the wilderness
of disappointment in the present by their endless promises of the
future: they take him up to the top of an exceeding high mountain and
shew him, beyond the dark clouds and rolling mists at his feet, a vision
of the celestial city, far off, it may be, but radiant with unearthly
splendour, bathed in the light of dreams.”</p>
<p>Dr. J. G. FRAZER, <em>«The Golden Bough</em></p>
<p>“So far, therefore, <strong>as the public profession of magic has
been one of the roads by which men have passed to supreme power, it has
contributed to emancipate mankind from the thraldom of tradition and to
elevate them into a larger, f reer life, with a broader outlook, on the
worid. This is no small service rendered to humanity.</strong> And when
we remember further that in another direction magic has paved the way
for science, we are forced to admit that if the black art has done much
evil, it has also been the source of much good that if it is the child
of error, <strong>it has yet been the mother of freedom and
truth.”</strong></p>
<p>Ibid.</p>
<p>“Prove all things; hold fast that which is good”.</p>
<p>St. Paul.</p>
<p>“Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of
the wand and the work of the sword: these he shall learn and teach. “He
must teach ; but he may make severe the ordeals. “The word of the Law is
0EAHMA.” LIBER AL vel xxxi: The Book of the Law.</p>
<p>This book is for ALL:</p>
<p>for every man, woman, and child.</p>
<p>My former work has been misunderstood, and its scope limited, by my
use of technical terms. It has attracted only too many dilettanti and
eccentrics, weaklings seeking in “Magic” an escape from reality. I
myself was first consciously drawn to the subject in this way. And it
has repelled only too many scientific and practicai minds, such as I
most designed to influence.</p>
<p>But MAGICK is for ALL.</p>
<p>I have written this book to help the Banker, the Pugilist, the
Biologist, the Poet, the Navvy, the Grocer, the Factory Girl, the
Mathematician, the Stenographer, the Golfer, the Wife, the Consul — and
ail the rest — to fulfil themselves perfectly, each in his or her own
proper function. Let me explain in a few words how it came about that I
blazoned the word <strong>MAGICK</strong> upon the Banner that I have
borne before me all my life. Before I touched my teens, I was already
aware that I was THE BEAST whose number is 666. I did not understand in
the least what that implied; it was a passionately ecstatic sense of
identity. In my third year at Cambridge, I devoted myself consciously to
the Great Work, understanding thereby the Work of becoming a Spiritual
Being, free from the constraints, accidents, and deceptions of material
existence. I found myself at a loss for a name to designate my work,
just as H. P. Blavatsky some years earlier. “Theosophy”, “Spiritualism”,
“Occultism”, “Mysticism”, ail involved undesirable connotations. I chose
therefore the name. <strong>“MAGICK”</strong> as essentially the most
sublime, and actually the most discredited, of ail the available terms.
I swore to rehabilitate <strong>MAGICK,</strong> to identify it with my
own career; and to compel mankind to respect, love, and trust that which
they scorned, hated and feared. I hâve kept my Word. But the time is now
corne for me to carry my banner into the thick of the press of human
life.</p>
<p>I must make <strong>MAGICK</strong> the essential factor in the life
of <strong>ALL.</strong> In presenting this book to the world, I must
then explain and justify my position by formulating a définition of
MAGICK and setting forth its main principles in such a way that
<strong>ALL</strong> may understand instantly that their souls, their
lives, in every relation with every other human being and every
circumstance, depend upon <strong>MAGICK</strong> and the right
comprehension and right application thereof.</p>
<p>I. <em>DEFINITION.</em></p>
<p><strong>MAGICK</strong> <strong>is the Science and Art of causing
Change to occur in conformity with Will.</strong></p>
<p>(Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts
within my knowledge. I therefore take “magical weapons”, pen, ink, and
paper ; I write “incantations” — these sentences — in the “magical
language” i.e. that which is understood by the people I wish to
instruct; I call forth “spirits”, such as printers, publishers,
booksellers, and so forth, and constrain them to convey my message to
those people. The composition and distribution of this book is thus an
act of<br />
<strong>MAGICK</strong> by which I cause Changes to take place in
conformity with my Will * 1 )</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li><em>POSTULATE.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANY required Change may be effected by the application of the
proper kind and degree of Force in the proper manner through the proper
medium to the proper object.</strong> (Illustration: I wish to prepare
an ounce of Chloride of Gold. I must take the right kind of acid,
nitro-hydrochloric and no other, in sufficient quantity and of adéquate
strength, and place it, in a vessel which will not break, leak, or
corrode, in such a manner as will not produce undesirable results, with
the necessary quantity of Gold: and so forth. Every Change has its own
conditions. In the present State of our knowledge and power some changes
are not possible in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or
transform lead into tin, or create men from mushrooms. But it is
theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that
object is capable by nature; and the conditions are covered by the above
postulate.)</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THEOREMS.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(1) Every intentional act is a Magical Act. 1</strong>
(Illustration: See “Definition” above.)</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>By “intentional” I mean “willed”. But even unintentional act
so-seeming are not truly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the VŸ
ill-to-Live.</li>
</ol>
<p>I. In one sense Magick may be dehned as the name given to Science by
the vulgar.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Every successful act has conformed to the postulate. (3)
Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate have
not been fulfilled.</strong> (Illustrations: There may be failure to
understand the case; as when a doctor makes a wrong diagnosis, and his
treatment injures his patient. There may be failure to apply the right
kind of force, as when a rustic tries to blow out an electric light.
There may be failure to apply the right degree of force, as when a
wrestler has his hold broken. There may be failure to apply the force in
the right manner, as when one presents a cheque at the wrong window of
the Bank. There may be failure to employ the correct medium, as when
Leonardo da Vinci found his masterpiece fade away. The force may be
applied to an unsuitable object, as when one tries to crack a stone,
thinking it a nut.) <strong>(4) The first requisite for causing any
change is ihorough qualitative and quantitative understanding of the
conditions.</strong> (Illustration: The most common cause of failure in
life is ignorance of one’s own True Will, or of the means by which to
fulfil that ill. A man may fancy himself a painter, and waste his life
trying to become one; or he may be really a painter, and yet fail to
understand and to measure the difficulties peculiar to that career.)
<strong>(5) The second requisite of causing any change is the practical
ability to set in right motion the necessary forces.</strong>
(Illustration: A banker may hâve a perfect grasp of a given situation,
yet lack the quality of decision, or the assets, necessary to take
advantage of it.) <strong>(6) “Every man and every woman is a
star’.</strong> That is to say, every human being is intrinsically an
independent individual with his own proper character and proper motion.
<strong>(7) Every man and every woman has a course, depending partly on
the self, and partly on the environment which is natural and necessary
for each. Anyone who is forced from his own course, either through not
understanding himself, or through external opposition, cornes into
conflict with the order of the Universe, and suffers
accordingly.</strong> (Illustration: A man may think it his duty to act
in a certain way, through having made a fancy picture of himself,
instead of investigating his actual nature. For example, a woman may
make hei self misérable for life by thinking that she prefers love to
social considération, or vice versa . One woman may stay with an
unsympathetic nusband when she would really be happy in an attic with a
lover, while another may fool herself into a romande elopement when her
only true pleasures are those of presiding at fashionable functions.
Again, a boy’s instinct may tell him to go to sea, while his parents
insist on his becoming a doctor. In such a case, he will be both
unsuccessful and unhappy in medicine.) <strong>(8)A Man whose conscious
will is at odds with his True Will is wasting his strength. He cannot
hope to influence his environment efficiently.</strong> (Illustration:
When Civil War rages in a nation, it is in no condition to undertake the
invasion of other countries. A man with cancei employs his nourishment
alike to his own use and to that of the enemy which is part of himself.
He soon fails to resist the pressure of his environment. In practical
life, a man who is doing what his conscience tells him to be wrong will
do it verv clumsily. At first!) <strong>(9) A man who is doing his True
Will has the inertia of fhe Universe to assist him.</strong>
(Illustration, fhe first principle of success in évolution is that the
individual should be true to his own nature, and at the same time adapt
himself to his environment.) <strong>(10) Nature is a continuous
phenomenon, through we do not know in ail cases how things are
connected.</strong> (Illustration: Human consciousness depends on the
properties of protoplasm, the existence of which dépends on innumerable
physical conditions peculiar to this planet and this planet is
determined by the mechanical balance of the whole universe of matter. We
may then say that our consciousness is causally connected with the
remotest galaxies; yet we do not know even how it arises from — or with
— the molecular changes in the brain.) <strong>(11) Science enahles us
to take advantage of the continuity of Nature by the empirical
application of certain principles whose interplay involves different
orders of idea connected with each other in a way beyond our présent
comprehension.</strong> (Illustration: We are able to light cities by
rule-of-thumb methods. We do not know what consciousness is, or how it
is connected with muscular action ; what electricity is or how it is
connected with the machines that generate it; and our methods depend on
calculations involving mathematical ideas which have no correspondence
in the Universe as we know it. ) <strong>(12) Man is ignorant of the
nature of his own being and powers. Even his idea of his limitations is
based on expérience of the past, and every step in his progress extends
his empire. There is therefore no reason to assign theoretical limits 1
2 to what lie may be, or to what he may do.</strong> (Illustration: A
generation ago it was supposed theoretically impossible that man should
ever know the Chemical composition of the fixed stars. It is known that
our senses are adapted to receive only an infinitesimal fraction of the
possible rates of vibration. Modern instruments have enabled us to
detect some of these supra-sensibles by indirect methods, and even to
use their peculiar qualities in the service of man, as in the case of
the rays of Hertz and Roentgen. As Tyndall said, man might at any moment
learn to perceive and utilise vibrations of ail conceivable and
inconceivable kinds. The question of Magick is a question of discovering
and employing hitherto unknown forces in nature. We know that they
exist, and we cannot doubt the possibility of mental or physical
instruments capable of bringing us into relation with them.)
<strong>(13) Every man is more or less aware that his individuality
comprises several orders of existence, even when he maintains that his
subtler priciples are merely symptomatic of the changes in his gross
vehicle. A similar order may be assumed to extend throughout
nature.</strong> (Illustration: One does not confuse the pain of
toothache with</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For instance, “irrational”, “unreal”, and “infinité”
expressions.</p></li>
<li><p>i.e., except — possibly — in the case of logically absurd
questions, such as the Schoolmen discussed in connection with
“God”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>the decay which causes it. Inanimate objects are sensitive to certain
physical forces, such as electrical and thermal conductivity ; but
neither in us nor in them — so far as we know — is there any direct
conscious perception of these forces. Imperceptible influences are
therefore associated with ail material phenomena; and there is no reason
why we should not work upon matter through those subtle energies as we
do through their material bases. In fact, we use magnetic force to move
iron, and solar radiation to reproduce images.)</p>
<p><strong>(14) Man is capable of being, and using, anything which he
perceives, for everything that he perceives is in a certain sense a part
of his being. He may thus subjugate the whole Universe of which he is
conscious to his individual Will.</strong> (Illustration: Man has used
the idea of God to dictate his Personal conduct, to obtain power over
his fellows, to excuse his crimes, and for innumerable other purposes,
including that of realizing himself as God. He has used the irrational
and unreal conceptions of mathematics to help him in the construction of
mechanical devices. He has used his moral force to influence the actions
even of wild animals. He has employed poetic genius for political
purposes.) <strong>(15) Every force in the Universe is capable of being
transformed into any other kind of force by using suitable means. There
is thus an inexhaustible supply of any particular kind of force that we
may need.</strong> (Illustration: Heat may be transformed into light and
power by using it to drive dynamos. The vibrations of the air may be
used to kill men by so ordering them in speech as to inflame war-like
passions. The hallucinations connected with the mysterious energies of
sex result in the perpetuation of the species.) <strong>(16) The
application of any given force affects ail the orders of being which
exist in the object to which it is applied, whichever of those orders is
directly affected.</strong> (Illustration: If I strike a man with a
dagger, his consciousness, not his body only, is affected by my act;
although the dagger, as such, has no direct relation therewith.
Similarly, the power of my thought may so work on the minci of another
person as to produce far-reaching physical changes in him, or in others
through him.) <strong>(17) A man may learn to use any force so as to
serve any purpose, by taking advantage of the above theorems.</strong>
(Illustration: A man may use a razor to make himself vigilant over his
speech, by using it to cut himself whenever he unguardedly utters a
chosen word. He may serve the same purpose by resolving that every
incident of his life shall remind him of a particular thing, making
every impression the starting point of a connected series of thoughts
ending in that thing. He might also devote his whole energies to some
one particular object, by resolving to do nothing at variance therewith,
and to make every act turn to the advantage of that object.)
<strong>(18) He may attract to himself any force of the Universe by
making himself a fit réceptacle for it, establishing a connection with
it, and arranging conditions so that its nature compels it to flow
toward him.</strong> (Illustration: If I want pure water to drink, I dig
a well in a place where there is underground water; I prevent it from
leaking away; and I arrange to take advantage of water’s accordance with
the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it.) <strong>(19) Man’s sense of
himself as separate from, and opposed to, the Universe is a bar to his
conducting its currents. It insulates him.</strong> (Illustration: A
popular leader is most successful when he forgets himself, and remembers
only “The Cause”. Self-seeking engenders jealousies and schism. When the
organs of the body assert their presence otherwise than by silent
satisfaction, it is a sign that they are diseased. The single exception
is the organ of reproduction. Yet even in this case its self-assertion
bears witness to its dissatisfaction with itself, since it cannot fulfil
its function until completed by its counterpart in another
organization.) <strong>(20) Man can only attract and employ the forces
for which he is really fitted.</strong> (Illustration: You cannot make a
silk purse ont of a sow’s ear. A true man of science learns from every
phenomenon. But Nature is dumb to the hypocrite; for in her there is
nothing false. 1 ) <strong>(21) There is no limit to the extent of the
relations of any man with the Universe in essence; for as soon as man
makes himself one with any idea the means of measurement cease to exist.
But liis power to utilize that force is limited by his mental power and
capacity, and by the circumstances of his human environment.</strong>
(Illustration: When a man falls in love, the whole world becomes, to
him, nothing but love boundless and immanent; but his mystical State is
not contagious; his fellow-men are either amused or annoyed. He can only
extend to others the effect which his love has had upon himself by means
of his mental and physical qualities. Thus, Catullus, Dante and
Swinburne made their love a mighty mover of mankind by virtue of their
power to put their thoughts on the subject in musical and eloquent
language. Again, Cleopatra and other people in authority moulded the
fortunes of many other people by allowing love to influence their
political actions. The Magician, however well he succeed in making
contact with the secret sources of energy in nature, can only use them
to the extent permitted by his intellectual and moral qualities.
Mohammed’s intercourse with Gabriel was only effective because of his
statesmanship, soldiership, and the sublimity of his command of Arabic.
Hertz’s discovery of the rays which we now use for wireless telegraphy
was sterile until reflected through the minds and wills of the people
who could take his truth, and transmit it to the world of action bv
means of mechanical and économic instruments.) <strong>(22) Every
individual is essentially sufficient to himself. But he is
unsatisfactory to himself until he has established himself in his right
relation with the Universe.</strong> (Illustration: A microscope,
however perfect, is useless in the</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>It is no objection that the hypocrite is himself part of Nature. He
is an “endothermic” product, divided against himself, with a tendency to
break up. He will see his own qualities everywhere, and thus obtain a
radical misconception of phenomena. Most religions of the past have
failed by expecting Nature to conform with their ideals of proper
conduct.</li>
</ol>
<p>hands of savages. A poet, however sublime, must impose himself upon
his génération if he is to enjoy (and even to understand) himself, as
theoretically should be the case.)</p>
<p><strong>(23) Magick is the Science of understanding oneself and one’s
conditions. It is the Art of applying that understanding in
action.</strong> (Illustration: A golf club is intended to move a
special bail in a special way in spécial circumstances. A Niblick should
rarely be used on the tee, or a Brassie under the bank of a bunker. But
also, the use of any club demands skill and experience.) <strong>(24)
Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is.</strong>
(Illustration: To insist that any one else shall comply with one’s own
standards is to outrage, not only him, but oneself, since both parties
are equally born of necessity.) <strong>(25) Every man must do Magick
each time that he acts or even thinks, since a thought is an internal
act whose influence ultimately affects action, though it may not do so
at the time.</strong> (Illustration: The least gesture causes a change
in a man’s own body and in the air around him; it disturbs the balance
of the entire Universe, and its effects continue eternally throughout
all space. Every thought, however swiftly suppressed, has its effect on
the mind. It stands as one of the causes of every subsequent thought,
and tends to influence every subsequent action. A golfer may lose a few
yards on his drive, a few more with his second and third, he may lie on
the green six bare inches too far from the hole 1 , but the net resuit
of these trifling mishaps is the différence of a whole stroke, and so
probably between halving and losing the hole.) <strong>(26) Every man
has a right, the right of self-preservation, to fulfil himself to the
utmost. 1</strong> (Illustration: A function imperfectly performed
injures, not</p>
<p>I. Men of “criminal nature” are simply at issue with their true
Wills. The murderer has the Will-to-Live; and his will to murder is a
false wilî at variance with his true Will, since he risks death at the
hands of Society by obeying his criminal impulse.</p>
<p>only itself, but everything associated with it. If the heart is
afraid to beat for fear of disturbing the liver, the liver is starved
for blood, and avenges itself on the heart by upsetting digestion, which
disorders respiration, on which cardiac welfare dépends.) <strong>(27)
Every man should make Magick the keynote of his life. He should learn
its laws and live by them.</strong> (Illustration: The Banker should
discover the real meaning of his existence, the real motive which led
him to choose that profession. He should understand banking as a
necessary factor in the economic existence of mankind, instead of as
merely a business whose objects are independent of the general welfare.
He should learn to distinguish false values from real, and to act not on
accidental fluctuations but on considerations of essential importance.
Such a banker will prove himself superior to others; because he will not
be an individual limited by transitory things, but a force of Nature, as
impersonal, impartial and eternal as gravitation, as patient and
irresistible as the tides. His System will not be subject to panic, any
more than the law of Inverse Squares is disturbed by Elections. He will
not be anxious about his affairs because they will not be his; and for
that reason he will be able to direct them with the calm, clear-headed
confidence of an onlooker, with intelligence unclouded by self-interest
and power unimpaired by passion.) <strong>(28) Every man has a right to
fulfil his own will without being afraid that it may interfere with that
of others; for if he is in his proper place, it is the fault of others
if they interfere with him.</strong> (Illustration: If a man like
Napoleon were actually appointed by destiny to control Europe, he should
not be blamed for exercising his rights. To oppose him would be an
error. Any one so doing would have made a mistake as to his own destiny,
except in so far as it might be necessary for him to learn the lessons
of defeat. The sun moves in space without interference. The order of
Nature provides an orbit for each star. A clash proves that one or the
other has strayed from its course. But as to each man that keeps his
true course, the more firmly he acts, the less likely are others to get
in his way. His example will help them to find their own paths and
pursue them. Every man that becomes a Magician helps others to do
likewise. The more firmly and surely men move, and the more such action
is accepted as the standard of morality, the less will conflict and
confusion hamper humanity.)</p>
<p>I hope that the above principles will demonstrate to
<strong>ALL</strong> that their welfare, their very existence, is bound
up in <strong>MAGICK.</strong> I trust that they will understand, not
only the reasonableness, but the necessity of the fundamental truth
which I was the means of giving to mankind: <strong>“Do what thou wilt
shall be the whole of the Law.”</strong> I trust that they will assert
themselves as individually absolute, that they will grasp the fact that
it is their right to assert themselves, and to accomplish the task for
which their nature fits them. Yea, more, that this is their duty, and
that not only to themselves but to others, a duty founded upon universal
necessity, and not to be shirked on account of any casual circumstances
of the moment which may seem to put such conduct in the light of
inconvenience or even of cruelty. I hope that the principles outlined
above will help them to understand this book, and prevent them from
being deterred from its study by the more or less technical language in
which it is written. The essence of <strong>MAGICK</strong> is simple
enough in all conscience. It is not otherwise with the art of
government. The Aim is simply prosperity; but the theory is tangled, and
the practice beset with briars. In the same way <strong>MAGICK</strong>
is merely to be and to do. I should add: a “to suffer”. For Magick is
the verb and it is part of the Training to use the passive voice. This
is, however, a matter of Initiation rather than of Magick in its
ordinary sense. It is not my fauJt if being is baffling, and doing
desperate! Yet, once the above principles are firmly fixed in the mind,
it is easy enough to sum up the situation very shortly. One must find
out for oneself, and make sure beyond doubt, who one is, what one is,
why one is. This done, one may put the Will which is implicit in the
“Why” into words, or rather into One Word. Being thus conscious of the
proper course to pursue, the next thing is to understand the conditions
necessary to following it out. After that, one must eliminate from
oneself every element alien or hostile to success, and develop those
parts of oneself which are specially needed to control the aforesaid
conditions. Let us make an analogy. A nation must become aware of its
own character before it can be said to exist. From that knowledge it
must divine its destiny. It must then consider the political conditions
of the world ; how other countries may help it or hinder it. It must
then destroy in itself any elements discordant with its destiny. Lastly,
it must develop in itself those qualifies which will enable it to combat
successfully the external conditions which threaten to oppose its
purpose. We have had a recent example in the case of the young German
Empire, which, knowing itself and its will, disciplined and trained
itself so that it conquered the neighbours which had oppressed it for so
many centuries. But after 1866 and 1870, 1914! It mistook itself for
superhuman, it willed a thing impossible, it failed to eliminate its own
internal jealousies, it failed to understand the conditions of victory,
it did not train itself to hold the sea, and thus, having violated every
principle of <strong>MAGICK,</strong> it was pulled down and broken into
pieces by provincialism and democracy, so that neither individual
excellence nor civic virtue has yet availed to raise it again to that
majestic unity which made so bold a bid for the mastery of the race of
man.</p>
<p>The sincere student will discover, behind the symbolic technicalities
of this book, a practical method of making himself a</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At least, it allowed England to discover its intentions, and so to
combine the world against it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Magician. The processes described will enable him to discriminate
between what he actually is, and what he has fondly imagined himself to
be. 2 He must behold his soul in all its awful nakedness, he must not
fear to look on that appalling actuality. He must discard the gaudy
garments with which his shame has screened him; he must accept the fact
that nothing can make him anything but what he is. He may lie to
himself, drug himself, hide himself; but he is always there. Magick will
teach him that his mind is playing him traitor. It is as if a man were
told that tailors’ fashion-plates were the canon of human beauty, so
that he tried to make himself formless and featureless like them, and
shuddered with horror at the idea of Holbein making a portrait of him.
Magick will show him the beauty and majesty of the self which he has
tried to suppress and disguise. Having discovered his identity, he will
soon perceive his purpose. Another process will show him how to make
that purpose pure and powerful. He may then learn how to estimate his
environment, learn how to make allies, how to make himself prevail
against all powers whose error has caused them to wander across his
path. In the course of this Training, he will learn to explore the
Hidden Mysteries of Nature, and to develop new senses and faculties in
himself, whereby he may communicate with, and control, Beings and Forces
pertaining to orders of existence which</p>

<li>Professor Sigmund Freud and his school have, in recent years,
discovered a part of this body of Truth, which has been taught for many
centuries in the Sanctuaries of Initiation. But failure to grasp the
fullness of Truth, especially that implied in my Sixth Theorem (above)
and its corollaries, has led him and his followers into the error of
admitting that the avowedly suicidai “Censor” is the proper arbiter of
conduct. Official psycho-analysis is therefore committed to upholding a
fraud, although the foundation of the science was the observation of the
disastrous effects on the individual of being false to his Unconscious
Self, whose “writing on the wall” in dream language is the record of the
sum of the essential tendencies of the true nature of the individual.
The resuit has been that psycho-analysts have misinterpreted life, and
announced the absurdity that every human being is essentially an
anti-social, criminal, and insane animal. It is evident that the errors
of the Unconscious of which the psycho-analysts complain are neither
more nor less than the “original sin” of the theologians whom they
despise so heartily.</li>

<p>have been hitherto inaccessible to profane research, and available
only to that unscientific and empirical <strong>MAGICK</strong> (of
tradition) which I came to destroy in order that I might fulfil. I send
this book into the world that every man and woman may take hold of life
in the proper manner. It does not matter if one’s present house of flesh
be the hut of a shepherd; by virtue of my <strong>MAGICK</strong> he
shall be such a shepherd as David was. If it be the studio of a
sculptor, he shall so chisel from himself the marble that masks his idea
that he shall be no less a master than Rodin. Witness mine hand :</p>

classification of ail formulae under the headings of the elemental
weapons,—the Wand, Cup, Dagger, and Pantacle.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter III. The Formula of Tetragrammaton</strong> The
formula of création described and explained.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter IV. The Formula of Alhim : also that of
Alim.</strong> Formulae of consecration, and of re-arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter V. The Formula of I.A.O.</strong> The formula of the
rédemption of mankind, extended by the Master Therion to F.LA.O.F. to
satisfy the new conditions of Magick imposed by progress.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter VI. The Formula of the Néophyte</strong> The ceremony
to endow a thing inert and impotent with balanced motion in a given
direction.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter VII. The Formula of the Holy Graal : and of
Abrahadabra</strong> Formulae of renunciation, and of the Great Work or
Mystical Union with God. <strong>Of Certain Other Words</strong>
Formulae of Vitriol : ΑΓΑΠιΙ ; ΘΕΛΗΜΑ and AUMGN explained in detail.
<strong>Some Remarks on the Magical Memory</strong> Shows the importance
of remembering previous incarnations, and gives practical instruction in
the Art. The truth is to be apprehended by the correct translation of
the symbolic language in which the memory speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter VIII. Of Equilibrium</strong> Any idea (below the
Abyss) not equilibrated with its opposite contains in itself unmitigated
duality or falsehood.</p>
<p><strong>Of the General and Particular Method of Préparation of the
Furniture of the Temple and the Instruments of Art</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter IX. Of Silence and Secrecy: and of the Barbarous
Names of Evocation</strong> Instruction in the theory and practice of
conjurations, “The long strings of formidable words which roar and moan
through so many conjurations, hâve a real effect in exalting the
consciousness of the magician to the proper pitch.”</p>
<p><strong>Chapter X. Of the Gestures</strong> Instruction in the theory
and technique of circumambulations, changes of position, and knocks or
knells.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XI. Of our Lady Babalon, and of the Beast whereon she
rideth</strong> The MASTER THERION will only communicate this section
verbally to those fit to receive it. <strong>Also concerning
Transformations:</strong> Transformation can be achieved either by
building up the appropriate body from its éléments, or by taking some
organism already existing and taking possession of the same.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XII. Of the Bloody Sacrifice</strong> Energy is
liberated varying in quantity according to the size and health of the
animal and in quality according to its mental and moral character.
<strong>Of Matters Cognate:</strong> Concerning the Sacrifice veiled
beneath the formula of the ROSY CROSS. The victim in this instance is
the Magician himself.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XIII. Of the Banishings and
Purifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter XIV. Of the Consecrations:</strong> Consecration is
the active dedication of a being to a single purpose. Banishing prevents
its use for any other purpose ; but it remains inert until consecrated.
<strong>An Account of the Nature and Nurture of the Magical
Link</strong> In every operation of Magick the Link must be properly
made ; i.e. the appropriate kind of means used in adéquate measure, and
applied in ways pertinent to the purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XVI. Part I. Of the Oath</strong> The foundation of
ail work in MAGICK is an affirmation of the Will. An oath binds the
Magician for ever.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XV. Of the Invocation</strong> The secret is “Inflame
thyself in praying.”</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XVI. Part II Of the Charge to the Spirit, with some
account of the Constraints and Curses occasionally
necessary</strong></p>

instruction to guard the Magician from obsession during and after an
operation.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XVIII. Of Clairvoyance; and of the Body of Light Its
Powers and its Development</strong> Theory and practice of the
development of the powers of the astral body, particularly those of
sight, travel and interprétation. Until this has been accomplished the
Magician is not fitted to deal with the Invisible. <strong>Also
concerning Divination</strong> The art of communication with superior
Intelligences through the medium of a suitable sériés of symbols. Five
Systems are discussed and compared with each other ; astrology,
geomancy, the Tarot, the Holy Qabalah, and the Yi King.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XIX. Of Dramatic Rituals</strong> Their object is the
invocation of a God, and that God is conceived of in a more or less
material and personal fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XX. Of the Eucharist</strong> This is more important
than any other ceremony of MAGICK. The whole of the force expended is
completely reabsorbed, and in addition is that vast gain represented by
the Abyss between Man and God.</p>
<p><strong>Of the Art of Alchemy</strong> Alchemical and magical
symbology are reconciled. The object of the Alchemist is to take a dead
thing, impure, valueless, and powerless, and transform it into a live
thing, active, invaluable and thaumaturgic.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter XXI Of Black Magic</strong> The Black Brothers are
those who “shut themselves up,” who refuse their blood to the Cup, who
hâve trampled Love in the race for self-aggrandisement. <strong>Of Pacts
with the Devil</strong> The powers of nature are to be trained and tamed
to the saddle and bridle. “My Adepts stand upright, their heads above
the heavens, their feet below the hells.” <strong>Of the Main Types of
the Operations of Magick Art</strong> A special section is devoted to
Necromancy and Spiritism. <strong>Of the Powers of the Sphinx</strong>
Instruction in mental and bodily training, which is the basis of the
Great Work.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix I.</strong> General literature recommended to
aspirants for The A.A. . and a list of the principal books of
instruction issued by the A.A.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix II. One Star in Sight.</strong> An essay on the
structure and System of the Great White Brotherhood.</p>

schoüon of the Ritual successfully employed by the MASTER THERION for
the Attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian
Angel.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix IV.</strong> Tables showing the principal
correspondences Ci the Qabalah, reprinted with additions from 777.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix V.</strong> A few principal Rituals, Books of
Instruction mostly reprinted from the 11 volumes of the Equinox.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix VI.</strong> Notes for an Astral Atlas» A detailed
uranography of the Astral Plane. Gontains a discourse on the objective
and subjective existence of “Astral Seings,” and culminâtes with an
account of the Book of the Law. This is a magical document communicated
to the MASTER THERION by an Intelligence giving the name of AIWAZ. It
proves the prime postulate of religion, namely the existence of
praeter-human intelligence independent of bodily form.</p>
<p>###CHAPTER O</p>
<p>The Magical Theory of the Universe.</p>
<p><strong>There are three main theories of the Universe: Dualism,
Monism and Nihilism.</strong> It is impossible to enter into a
discussion of their relative merits in a popular manual of this sort.
They may be studied in Erdmann’s “History of Philosophy” and similar
treatises.</p>
<p><strong>All are reconciled and unified in the theory which we shall
now set forth.</strong> The basis of this Harrnony is given in Crowley’s
“Berashith” — to which reference should be made.</p>
<p><strong>Infinite space is called the goddess NUIT, while the
infinitely small and atomic yet omnipresent point is called HADIT. 1
These are unmanifest. One conjunction of these infinites is called
RA-HOOR-KHUIT, 2 a Unity which includes and heads all things. 3</strong>
(There is also a particular Nature of Him, in certain conditions, such
as hâve obtained since the Spring of 1904, e.v.) This profoundly
mystical conception</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I present this theory in a very simple form. I cannot even explain
(for instance) that an idea may not refer to Being at ail, but to Going.
The Book of the Law demands special study and initiated apprehension. 2
. More correctly, HERU-RA-HA, to include HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT. 3 . The basis
of this theology is given in Liber CCXX, AL vel Legis which forms Part
IV of this Book 4. Hence I can only outline the matter in a very crude
way; it would require a separate treatise to discuss even the true
meaning of the terms employed, and to show how The Book of the Law
anticipates the recent discoveries of Frege, Cantor, Poincaré, Russell,
Whitehead, Einstein and others.</li>
</ol>
<p>is based upon actual spiritual experience, but the trained reason 1
can reach a reflexion of this idea by the method of logical
contradiction which ends in reason transcending itself. The reader
should consult “The Soldier and the Hunchback” in Equinox I, I, and
“Konx Om Pax”. <em>Unity transcends consciousness.</em> It is above all
division. The Father of thought — the Word — is called Chaos — the dyad.
The number Three, the Mother, is called Babalon. In connection with this
the reader should study “The Temple of Solomon the King” in Equinox I,
V, and Liber 418. This first triad is essentially unity, in a manner
transcending reason. The comprehension of this Trinity is a matter of
spiritual experience. All true gods are attributed to this Trinity. 2 3
An immeasurable abyss divides it from all manifestations of Reason or
the lower qualities of man. In the ultimate analysis of Reason, we find
all reason identified with this abyss. Yet this abyss is the crown of
the mind. Purely intellectual faculties all obtain here. This abyss has
no number, for in it ail is confusion. Below this abyss we find the
moral qualifies of Man, of which there are six. The highest is
symbolised by the number Four. Its nature is fatherly 5; Mercy and
Authority are the attributes of its dignity. The number Five is balanced
against it. The attributes of Five are Energy and Justice. Four and Five
are again combined and harmonized in the number Six, whose nature is
beauty and harmony, mortality and immortality. In the number Seven the
feminine nature is again predominant,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All advance in understanding demands the acquisition of a new
point-of-view. Modem conceptions of Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics
are sheer paradox to the “plain man” who thinks of Matter as something
that one can knock up against.</li>
<li>Considerations of the Christian Trinity are of a nature suited only
to Initiates of the IX° of O.T.O., as they enclose the final secret of
ail practical Magick.</li>
<li>Each conception is, however, balanced in itself. Four is also
Daleth, the letter of Venus; so that the mother-idea is included. Again,
the Sephira of 4 is Chesed, referred to Water. 4 is ruled by Jupiter,
Lord of the Lightning (Fire) yet ruler of Air. Each Sephira is complete
in its way.</li>
</ol>
<p>but it is the masculine type of female, the Amazon, who is balanced
in the number Eight by the feminine type of male. In the number Nine we
reach the last of the purely mental qualities. It identifies change with
stability. Pendant to this sixfold System is the number Ten 1 which
includes the whole of Matter as we know it by the senses. It is
impossible here to explain thoroughly the complete conception; for it
cannot be too clearly understood that this is a classification of the
Universe, that there is nothing which is not comprehended therein. The
Article on the Qabalah in Vol. I, No. V of the Equinox is the best which
has been written on the subject. It should be deeply studied, in
connection with the Qabalistic Diagrams in Nos. II and III: “The Temple
of Solomon the King”. Such is a crude and elementary sketch of this
System. The formula of Tetragrammaton is the most important for the
practical magician. Here Yod = 2, Hé = 3, Vau = 4 to 9, Hé final = 10.
The Number Two represents Yod, the Divine or Archetypal World, and the
Number One is only attained by the destruction of the God and the
Magician in Samadhi. The world of Angels is under the numbers Four to
Nine, and that of spirits under the</p>

<p>contains ail the numbers.</p>
<p>number ten.1 All these numbers are o£ course parts of the magician
himself considered as the microcosm. The microcosm is an exact image o£
the Macrocosm; the Great Work is the raising of the whole man in perfect
balance to the power of Infinity.</p>
<p>The reader will remark that ail criticism directed against the
Magical Hierarchy is futile. One cannot call it incorrect — the only
line to take might be that it was inconvénient. In the same way one
cannot say that the Roman alphabet is better or worse than the Greek,
since all required sounds can be more or less satisfactorily represented
by either; yet both these alphabets were found so liitle satisfactory
when it came to an attempt at phonetic printing of Oriental languages,
that the alphabet had to be expanded by the use of italics and other
diacritical marks. In the same way our magical alphabet of the Sephiroth
and the Paths (thirty-two letters as it were) has been expanded into the
four worlds corresponding to the four letters of the name YHVH; and each
Sephira is supposed to contain a Tree of Life of its own. Thus we obtain
four hundred Sephiroth instead of the original ten, and the Paths being
capable of similar multiplications, or rather of subdivision, the number
is still further extended. Of course this process might be indefinitely
continued without destroying the original System.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>It is not possible to give a full account of the twenty-two “paths”
in this condensed sketch. They should be studied in view of ail their
attributes in 777, but more especially that in which they are attributed
to the planets, elements and signs, as also to the Tarot Trumps, while
their position on the Tree itself and their position as links between
the particular Sephiroth which they join is the final key to their
understanding. It will be noticed that each chapter of this book is
attributed to one of them. This was not intentional. The book was
originally but a collection of haphazard dialogues between Fra. P. and
Soror A.; but on arranging the MSS, they fell naturally and of necessity
into this division. Conversely, my knowledge of the Schema pointed out
to me numerous gaps in my original exposition; thanks to this, I have
been able to make it a complete and systematic treatise. That is, when
my laziness had been jogged by the criticisms and suggestions of various
colleagues to whom I had submitted the early drafts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Apologia for this System is that our purest conceptions are
symbolized in Mathematics. “God is the Great Arithmetician.” “God is the
Grand Geometer.” It is best therefore to prepare to apprehend Him by
formulating our minds according to these measures. 1 To return, each
letter of this alphabet may have its special magical sigil. The student
must not expect to be given a cut-and-dried definition of what exactly
is meant by any of all this. On the contrary, he must work backwards,
putting the whole of his mental and moral outfit into these
pigeon-holes. You would not expect to be able to buy a filing cabinet
with the names of all your past, present and future correspondents ready
indexed: your cabinet has a System of letters and numbers meaningless in
them-selves, but ready to take on a meaning to you, as you fill up the
files. As your business increased, each letter and number would receive
fresh accessions of meaning for you and by adopting this orderly
arrangement you would be able to have a much more comprehensive grasp of
your affairs than would otherwise be the case. By the use of this System
the magician is able ultimately to unify the whole of his knowledge — to
transmute, even on the Intellectual Plane, the Many into the One.</p>
<p>The reader can now understand that the sketch given above of the
magical Hierarchy is hardly even an outline of the real theory of the
Universe. This theory may indeed be studied in the article already
referred to in No. V of the Equinox, and, more deeply, in the Book of
the Law and the Commentaries thereon: but the true understanding dépends
entirely upon the work of the Magician himself. Without magical
experience it will be meaningless. In this there is nothing peculiar. It
is so with ail scientific knowledge. A blind man might cram up astronomy
for the purpose of passing examinations, but his knowledge would be</p>
<p>I. By “God” I here mean the Ideal Identity of a man’s inmost nature.
“Something ourselves (I erase Arnold’s imbecile and guilty ‘not’) that
makes for righteousness;” righteousness being rightly defined as
internal coherence. (Internal Coherence implies that which is written
“Detegitur Yod.”)</p>
<p>almost entirely unrelated to his experience, and it would certainly
not give him sight. A similar phenomenon is observed when a gentleman
who has taken an “honours degree” in modern languages at Cambridge
arrives in Paris, and is unable to order his dinner. To exclaim against
the Master Therion is to act like a person who, observing this, should
attack both the professors of French and the inhabitants of Paris, and
perhaps go on to deny the existence of France.</p>
<p>Let us say, once again, that the magical language is nothing but a
convenient System of classification to enable the magician to docket his
experiences as he obtains them.</p>
<p>Yet this is true also, that, once the language is mastered, one can
divine the unknown by study of the known, just as one’s knowledge of
Latin and Greek enables one to understand some unfamiliar English word
derived from those sources. Also, there is the similar case of the
Periodic Law in Chemistry, which enables Science to prophesy, and so in
the end to discover, the existence of certain previously unsuspected
elements in nature. All discussions upon philosophy are necessarily
stérile, since truth is beyond language. Tliey are, however, useful if
carried far enough — if carried to the point when it becomes apparent
that all arguments are arguments in a circle. But discussions of the
details of purely imaginary: qualities are frivolous and may be deadly.
For the great danger of this magical theory is that the student may
mistake the alphabet for the things which the words represent.</p>
<p>An excellent man of great intelligence, a learned Qabalist, once
amazed the Master Therion by stating that the Tree of Life was the

principles of common sense. 1</p>
<p>A synopsis of the grades of the A.<em>. A.</em>, as illustrative of

<p>FU RT HE R CONCERNING THE MAGICAL U NIV ERSE</p>
<p>Ail these letters of the magical alphabet — referred to above — are
like so many names on a map. Man himself is a complété microcosm. Few
other beings hâve this balanced perfection. Of course every sun, every
planet, may hâve beings similarly constituted. 2 But when we speak of
dealing with the planets in Magick,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Long since writing the above, an even grosser imbecility bas been
perpetrated. One who ought to hâve known better tried to improve the
Tree of Life by turning the Serpent of Wisdom upside down! Yet he could
not even make his scheme symmetrical: bis little remaining good sense
revolted at the suprême atrocities. Yet be succeeded in reducing the
whole Magical Alphabet to nonsense, and shewing that he had never
understood its real meaning.</li>
</ol>
<p>The absurdity of any such disturbance of the arrangement of the Paths
is évident to any sober student from such examples as the following.
Binah, the Supernal Understanding, is connected with Tiphereth, the
Human Consciousness, by Zain, Gemini, the Oracles of the Gods, or the
Intuition. That is, the attribution represents a psychological fact: to
replace it by The Devil is either humour or plain idiocy. Again, the
card ’Fortitude”, Leo, balances Majesty and Mercy with Strength and
Severity: what sense is there in putting “Death”, the Scorpion, in its
stead ? There are twenty other mistakes in the new wonderful
illuminated-from-on-high attribution; the student can therefore be sure
of twenty more laughs if he cares to study it.</p>
<p>2 . Equally, of course, we hâve no means of knowing what we really
are. We are limited to symbols. And it is certain that ail our
sense-perceptions give only partial aspects of their objects. Sight, for
instance, tells us very little about solidity, weight, composition,
electrical character, thermal conductivity, etc., etc. It says nothing
at ail about the very existence of such vitally important ideas as Heat,
Hardness, and so on.</p>
<p>The impression which the mind combines from the senses can never
claim to be accurate or complété. We hâve indeed learnt that nothing is
fn itself what it seems to be to us.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>the référencé is usually not to the actual planets, but to parts of
the earth which are of the nature attributed to these planets. Thus,
when we say that Nakhiel is the “Intelligence” of the Sun, we do not
mean that he lives in the Sun, but only that he has a certain rank and
character; and although we can invoke hinij we do not necessarily mean
that he exists in the same sense of the Word in which our butcher
exists.</p>
<p>When we “conjure Nakhiel to visible appearance,” it may be that our
process resembles création — or, rather imagination — more nearly than
it does calling-forth. The aura of a man is called the “magical mirror
of the universe”; and, so far as any one can tell, nothing exists
outside of this mirror. It is at least convenient to represent the whole
as if it were subjective. It leads to less confusion. And, as a man is a
perfect microcosm, 1 it is perfectly easy to re-model one’s conception
at any moment. Now there is a traditional correspondance, which modem
experiment has shown to be fairly reliable. There is a certain natural
connexion between certain letters, words, numbers, gestures, sliapes,
perfumes and so on, so that any idea or (as we might call it) “spirit”,
may be composed or called forth by the use of those things which are
harmonious with it, and express particular parts of its nature. These
correspondences hâve been elaborately mapped in the Book 777 in a very
convenient and compendious form. It will be necessary for the student to
make a careful study of this book in connexion with some actual rituals
of Magick, for example, I. He is this only by définition. The universe
may contain an infinité variety of worlds inaccessible to human
appréhension. Yet, for this very reason, they do not exist for the
purposes of the argument. Man has, how- ever, some instruments of
knowledge; we may, therefore, define the Macrocosm as the totality of
things possible to his perception. As évolution deve- lops those
instruments, the Macrocosm and the Microcosm extend; but they always
maintain their mutual relation. Neither can possess any meaning except
in terrns o£ the other. Our <sup>dveries</sup> are exactly as much of
ourselves as they are of Nature. America and Electricity did, in a
sense, exist before we were aware of them; but they are even now no more
than incomplète ideas, expressed in symbolic terrns of a sériés of
relations between two sets of inscrutable phenomena.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>that of the évocation of Taphtatharath printed in Equinox I, III,
pages 170-190, where he will see exactîy why these things are to be
used. Of course, as the student advances in knowledge by expérience he
will find a progressive subtlety in the magical universe corresponding
to his own; for let it be said yet again! not only is his aura a magical
mirror of the universe, but the universe is a magical mirror of his
aura.</p>
<p>In this chapter we are only able to give a very thin outline of
magical theory — faint pencilling by weak and wavering fingers — for
this subject may almost be said to be co-extensive with one’s whole
knowledge.</p>
<p>Fhe knowledge of exoteric science is comically limited by the fact
that we hâve no access, except in the most indirect way, to any other
celestial body than our own. In the last few years, the semi-educated
hâve got an idea that they know a great deal about the universe, and the
principal ground for their fine opinion of themselves is usually the
téléphoné or the airship. It is pitiful to read the bombastic twaddle
about progress, which journalists and others, who wish to prevent men
from thinking, put out for consumption. We know infinitesimally little
of the material universe. Our detailed knowledge is so contemptibly
minute, that it is hardly worth référencé, save that our shame may spur
us to increased endeavour. Such know¬ ledge 1 as we hâve got is of a
very general and abstruse, of a philosopliical and almost magical
character. This consists principally of the conceptions of pure
mathematics. It is, therefore, almost legitimate to say that pure
mathematics is our link with the rest of the universe and with
“God”.</p>
<p>Now the conceptions of Magick are themselves profoundly mathematical.
The whole basis of our theory is the Qabalah, which corresponds to
mathematics and geometry. The method of operation in Magick is based on
this, in very much the same way as the laws of mechanics are based on
mathematics. So far, therefore as we can be be said to possess a magical
theory of the universe, it must be a matter solely of fundamental law,
with a</p>
<p>J* Knowledge is, moreover, an impossible conception. Ali propositions
corne ultimately back to “A is A”.</p>
<p>9 —</p>
<p>few simple and comprehensive propositions stated in very general
terms I might expend a life-time in exploring the details of one plane,
just as an explorer might give his life to one corner of Africa, or a
chemist to one subgroup of compounds. Each surh detailed piece of work
may be very valuable, but it does not as a rule throw light on the main
principles of the universe. Its truth is the truth of one angle. It
might even lead to error, if some inferior person were to generalize
from too few facts.</p>
<p>Imagine an inhabitant of Mars who wished to philosophise about the
earth, and had nothing to go by but the diary of some man at the North
Pôle! But the work of every explorer, on whatever branch of the Tree of
Life the Caterpillar he is after may happen to be crawling, is immensely
helped by a grasp of general principles. Every magician, therefore,
should study the Holy Qabalah. Once he has mastered the main principles,
he will find his work grow easy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>The Principles of Ritual,.</p>
<p>There is a single main définition of the object of all magical
Ritual. It is the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm. The
Suprême and Complété Ritual is there- fore the Invocation of the Holy
Guardian Angel; 1 or* in the language of Mysticism, Union with God.
2</p>
<p>All other magical Rituals are particular cases of this general
principle, and the only excuse for doing them is that it sometimes
occurs that one particular portion of the microcosm is so weak that its
imperfection of impurity would vitiate the Macrocosm of which it is the
image, Eidolon, or Reflexion. For example, God is above sex; and
therefore neither man nor woman as such can be said fully to understand,
much less to represent, God. It is therefore incumbent on the male
magician to cultivate those female virtues in which he is déficient, and
this task he must of course accomplish without in any way impairing his
virility. It will then be lawful for a magician to invoke Isis, and
identify himself with her; if he fail to do this, his appréhension of
the Universe when he attains Samadhi will lack the conception of
maternity. The resuit will be a metaphysical and — by corollary —
ethical limita¬ tion in the Religion which he founds. Judaism and Islam
are striking examples of this failure. To take another example, the
ascetic Üfe which dévotion to 1. See the “Book of the Sacred Magic of
Abramelin the Mage”; and Liber 418, 8th Aethyr, Liber Samekh; see
Appendix 3. 2. The différence between these operations is more of
theoreticaî than of practical importance.</p>
<p>magick so often involves argues a poverty o£ nature, a narrowness, a
lack of generosity. Nature is infinitely prodigal — not one in a million
seeds ever cornes to fruition. Whoso fails to recognise this, let him
invoke Jupiter. 1 2</p>
<p>The danger o£ cérémonial magick — the subtlest and deepest danger —is
this: that the magician will naturally tend to invoke that partial being
which most strongly appeals to him, so that his natural excess in that
direction will be still further exaggerated. Let him, before beginning
his Work, endeavour to map out his own being, and arrange his
invocations in such a way as to redress the balance. 2 This, of course,
should hâve been done in a preliminary fashion during the préparation of
the weapons and furniture of the Temple.</p>
<p>To consider in a more particular mammer this question of the Nature
of Ritual, we may suppose that he finds himself lacking in that
perception of the value of Life and Death, alike of individuals and of
races, which is characteristic of Nature. He has perhaps a tendency to
perceive the ‘first noble truth’ uttered by Buddha, that Everything is
sorrow. Nature, it seems, is a tragedy. He has perhaps even experienced
the great trance called Sorrow. He should then consider whether there is
not some Deity who expresses this Cycle, and yet whose nature is joy. He
will find what he requires in Dionysus.</p>
<p>There are three main methods of invoking any Deity.</p>
<p>The First Method consists of dévotion to that Deity, and, being
mainly mystical in character, need not be dealt with in this place,
especially as a perfect instruction exists in Liber 175 (See Âppendix).
The Second Method is the straightforward cérémonial invocation. It is
the method which was usually employed in the Middle Ages. Its advantage
is its directness, its disadvantage its 1. There are much deeper
considérations in which it appears that “Everything that is, is right”.
They are set forth elsewhere; we can only summarise them here by saying
that the survîval of the frttest is their upshot.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The ideaî method of doing this is given in Liber 913 (Equinox VII).
See also Liber CXI Aleph.</li>
</ol>
<p>12</p>
<p>crudity. The “Goetia” gives clear instruction in this method, and $o
do many other Rituals, white and black. We shall presently devote some
space to a clear exposition of this Art.</p>
<p>In the case of Bacchus, however, we may roughly outline the
procedure. We find that the symbolism of Tiphareth expresses the nature
of Bacchus. It is then necessary to construct a Ritual of Tiphareth. Let
us open the Book 777 ; we shall find in line 6 of each column the
various parts of our required apparatus. Having ordered everything duly,
we shall exalt the mind by repeated prayers or conjurations to the
highest conception of the God, until, in one sense or another of the
Word, He appears to us and floods our consciousness with the light of
His divinity.</p>
<p>The Third Method is the Dramatic , perhaps the most attractive of
ail; certainly it is so to the artist’s tempérament, for it appeals to
his imagination through his aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>Its disadvantage lies principally in the difficulty of its per¬
formance by a single person. But it has the sanction of the highest
antiquity, and is probably the most useful for the foundation of a
religion. It is the method of Catholic Christianity, and consists in the
dramatization of the legend of the God. The Bacchae of Euripides is a
magnificent example of such a Ritual; so also^ though in a less degree,
is the Mass. We may also mention many of the degrees in Freemasonry,
particularly the Third. The 5° — 6° Ritual published in N° III of the
Equinox is another example.</p>
<p>In the case of Bacchus, one commémorâtes firstly his birth of a
mortal mother who has yielded her treasure-house to the Father of AU, of
the jealousy and rage excited by this incarnation, and of the heavenly
protection afforded to the infant. Next should be commemorated the
journeying westward upon an ass. Now cornes the great scene of the
drama: the gentle, exquisite youth with his foliowing (chiefly composed
of women) seems to threaten the established order of things, and that
Established Order takes steps to put an end to the upstart. We find
Dionysus confronting the angry King, not with défiance, but with
meekness; yet with a subtle confidence, an underlying laughter. His
forehead is wreathed with vine tendrils. He is an effeminate figure with
those broad leaves clustered upon his brow? But those leaves hide</p>
<p>H</p>
<p>horns. King Pentheus, représentative of respectabilité 1 2 is
destroved by his pnde. He goes ont into the monntams to actack the
wornen who bave followed Bacchus, the youth whom Aie has mocked,
scourged, and put in chains, yet who h as only smiled; and by those
women, in their divine madness* he is torn</p>
<p>to pièces.</p>
<p>It has already seemed impertinent to say so mueh when Walter Pater
has told the story with such sympathy and insight. We will not further
transgress by dwelling upon the identity of this legend with the course
of Nature, its madness, its prodigality, its intoxication, its joy, and
above ali its sublime persistence through the cycles of Life and Death.
The pagan reader must labour to understand this in Pater’s “Greek
Studies”, and the Christian reader will recognise it, incident for
incident, in the story of Christ. This legend is but the dramatization
of Spring.</p>
<p>The magician who wishes to invoke Bacchus by this method must
therefore arrange a ceremony in which he takes the part of Bacchus,
undergoes ail His trials, and emerges triumphant from beyond death. He
must, however, be warned against mistaking the symbolism. In this case,
for example, the doctrine of individual immortality has been dragged in,
to the destruction, of truth. It is not that utterly worthless part of
man, his individual consciousness as John Smith, which défiés death —
that consciousness which dies and is reborn in every thought. That which
persists (if anything persist) is his real John Smithiness, a quality of
which he was probably never conscious in his life. ”</p>
<p>Even that does not persist unchanged. It is always growing. The Cross
is a barren stick, and the petals of the Rose fall and decayj but in the
union of the Cross and the Rose is a constant</p>

<p>succession of new lives. 1 Without this union, and without this death
of the individual, the cycle would be broken.</p>
<p>A chapter will be consecrated to removing the practical diffi-
culties of this method of Invocation. It will doubtless hâve been noted
by the acumen of the reader that in the great essentials these three
methods are one. In each case the magician identifies himself with the
Deity invoked. To invoke is to call in, just as to evoke ïs to call
forth. This is the essential différence between the two branches of
Magick. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the consciousness. In
évocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, créâtes a
microcosm. You i/zvoke a God into the Circle. You evokt a Spirit into
the Triangle. In the first method identity with the God is attained by J
ove and by surrender, by giving up or suppressing ail irrelevant (and
illusionary) parts of yourself. It is the weeding of a garden.</p>
<p>In the second method identity is attained by paying spécial attention
to the desired part of yourself: positive, as the first method is
négative. It is the potting-out and watering of a particular flower in
the garden, and the exposure of it to the sun.</p>
<p>In the third, identity is attained by sympathy. It is very difficult
for the ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play
or of a novelj but for those who can do so, this method is
unquestionably the best.</p>
<p>Observe: each element in this cycle is of equal value. It is wrong to
say triumphantly “Mors janua vitæ”, unless you add, with equal triumph,
“Vita janua mortis”. To one who understands this chain of the Aeons from
the point of view alike of the sorrowing Isis and of the triumphant
Osiris, not forgetting their link in the destroyer Apophis, there
remains no secret veiled in Nature. He cries that name of God which
throughout History has been echoed by one religion to another, the
infinité swelling paean I.A.O. ! 2</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>The Formulae of the Elemental Weapons.</p>
<p>Before discussing magical formulae in detail, one may observe that
most rituals are composite, and contain many formulae which must be
harmonized into one.</p>
<p>The fîrst formula is that of the wand. In the sphere of the principle
which the magician wishes to invoke, he rises from point to point in a
perpendicular line, and then descends 5 or else, beginning at the top,
he cornes directly down, invoking fîrst the god of that sphere by devout
supplication 1 that Fie may deign to send the appropriate Archangel. He
then beseeches the Àrchangel to send the Angel or Angels of that sphere
to his aid; he conjures this Angel or Angels to send the intelligence in
question, and this intelligence he will conjure with authority to compel
the obedience of the spirit and his manifestation. To this spirit he
issues commands .</p>
<p>It will be seen that this is a formula rather of évocation than of
invocation, and for the latter the procedure, though apparently the
same, should be conceived of in a difiFerent manner, which brings it
under another formula, that of Tetragrammaton. The essence of the force
invoked is one, but the “God” represents the germ or beginning of the
force, the “Archangel” its development; and so on, until, with the
“Spirit”, we hâve the completion and perfection of that force.</p>
<p>I. Beware, O brother, lest thou bend the knee! Liber CCXX teaches the
proper attitude. See also Liber CCCLXX. Infra, furthermore, there is
spécial instruction : Chapter XV and elsewhere.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>The formula of the Cup is not so well suited for Evocations, and the
magical Hierarchy is not involved in the same way; for the Cup being
passive rather than active, it is not fitting for the magician to use it
in respect of anything but the Highest. In practical working it
consequently means little but prayer, and that prayer the “prayer of
silence”. 1</p>
<p>The formula of the dagger is again unsuitable for either pur- pose,
since the nature of the dagger is to criticise, to destroy, to disperse
j and ail true magical ceremonies tend to concentration. The dagger will
therefore appear principally in the banishings, preliminary to the
ceremony proper.</p>
<p>The formula of the pantacle is again of no particular use; for the
pantacle is inert. In fine, the formula of the wand is the only one with
which we need more particularly concern ourselves. 2</p>
<p>Now in order to invoke any being, it is said by Hermes Tris- megistus
that the magi employ three methods. The first, for the vulgar, is that
of supplication. In this the crude objective theory is assumed as true.
There is a god named A, whom you, B, proceed to pétition, in exactly the
same sense as a boy might ask his father for pocket-mcney.</p>
<p>The second method involves a little more subtlety, inasmuch as the
magician endeavours to harmonize himself with the nature of the god, and
to a certain extent exalts himself, in the course of the ceremony; but
the third method is the only one worthy of our considération.</p>
<p>This consists of a real identification of the magician and the god.
Note that to do this in perfection involves the attain- ment of a
species of Samadhi; and this fact alone suffices to link irrefragably
magie k with mysticism.</p>
<p>Let us describe the magical method of identification. The symbolic
form of the god is first studied with as much care as an artist would
bestow upon his model, so that a perfectly clear and</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Considérations which might lead to a contrary conclusion are un-
suited to this treatise. See Liber LXXXI.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . Later, these remarks are amplified, and to some extent
modified.</p>
<p>unshakeable mental picture of the god is présent to the mind.
Similarly, the attributes of the god are enshrined in speech, and such
speeches are committed perfectly to memory. The invoca¬ tion will then
begin with a prayer to the god, commemorating his physical attributes,
always with profound understanding of their real meaning. In the second
fart of the invocation, the voice of the god is heard, and His
characteristic utterance is recited.</p>
<p>In the thirâ fortion of the invocation the magician asserts the
identity of himself with the god. In the fourth fortion the god is again
invoked, but as if by Himself, as if it were the utterance of the will
of the god that He should manifest in the magician. At the conclusion of
this, the original object of the invocation is stateci.</p>
<p>Th us, in the invocation of Thoth which is to be found in the rite of
Mercury (Equinox I, VI) and in Liber LXIV, the first part begins with
the words “Majesty of Godhead, wisdom- crowned TAHUTI, Thee, Thee I
invoke. Oh Thou of the Ibis head, Thee, Thee I invoke”$ and so on. At
the conclusion of this a mental image of the God, infinitely vast and
infinitely splendid, should be perceived, in just the same sense as a
man might see the Sun.</p>
<p>The second part begins with the words:</p>
<p>’“Behold! I am yesterday, to~day, and the brother of to- morrow.”</p>
<p>The magician should imagine that he is hearing this voice, and at the
same time that he is echoing it, that it is true also of himself. This
thought should so exalt him that he is able at its conclusion to utter
the sublime words which open the third part: “Behold! he is in me, and I
am in him.” At this moment, he loses con- sciousness of his mortal
being; he is that mental image which he previously but saw. This
consciousness is only complété as he goes on: “Mine is the radiance
wherein Ptah floateth over his firmament. I travel upon high. I tread
upon the firmament of Nu. I raise a flashing flame with the lightnings
of mine eye: ever rushing on in the splendour of the daily glorified Ra
— giving my life to the treaders of Earth !” This thought gives the
relation of God and Man from the divine point of view.</p>
<p>The magician is only recalled to himself at the conclusion of the</p>
<p>— 18 —</p>
<p>third part; in which occur, almost as if by accident, the words:
’’Therefore do ail things obey my word.” Yet in the fourth part, which
begins: “Therefore do thou corne forth unto me”, it is not really the
magician who is addressing the God; it is the God who hears the far-off
utterance of the magician. If this invocation has been correctly
performed, the words of the fourth part will Sound distant and strange.
It is surprising that a dummy (so the magus now appears to Himself)
should be able to speak!</p>
<p>The Egyptian Gods are so complété in their nature, so perfectly
spiritual and yet so perfectly material, that this one invocation is
sufficient. The God bethinks him that the spirit of Mercury should now
appear to the magician; and it is so. This Egyptian formula is therefore
to be preferred to the Hierarchical formula of the Hebrews with its
tedious prayers, conjurations, and curses.</p>
<p>It will be noted, however, that in this invocation of Thoth which we
hâve summârized, there is another formula contained, the Reverberating
or Reciprocating formula, which may be called the formula of Horus and
Harpocrates. The magician addresses the God with an active projection of
nis will, and then becomes passive while the God addresses the Universe.
In the fourth part he remains silent, listening, to the prayer which
arises therefrom.</p>
<p>The formula of this invocation of Thoth may also be classed under
Tetragrammaton. The first part is fire, the eager prayer of the
magician, the second water, in which the magician°listens to, or catches
the reflection of, the god. The third part is air, the marriage of fire
and water; the god and the man hâve become one; while the fourth part
corresponds to earth, the condensa¬ tion 01 matenalization of those
three highcr principles.</p>
<p>With regard to the Hebrew formulae, it is doubtful whether inost
magicians who use them hâve ever properly grasped the principles
underlying the method of identity. No passage which împlies it occurs to
mind, and the extant ntuais certainly give no hmt of such a conception,
or of any but the most personal and material views of the nature of
things. They seem to hâve thought that there was an Archangel named
Ratziel in exactly the same sense as there was a statesman named
Richelieu, an individual being living in a definite place. Eté had
possibly certain powers of a somewhat metaphysical order—he might be</p>
<p>— 19 —</p>
<p>in two places at once, 1 for example, though even the possibilité of
so simple a feat (in the case of spirits) seems to be denied by certain
passages in extant conjurations which tell the spint that if he happens
to be in chains in a particular place in Hell, or if some other magician
îs conjuring him so that he cannot comc, then let him send a spirit of
simîlar nature, or otherwisé avoid the dif- ficulty. But of course so
vulgar a conception would not occur to the student of the Qabalah. It is
just possible that the magi wrote their conjurations on this crude
hypothesis in order to avoid the clouding of the mind by doubt and
metaphysical spéculation.</p>
<p>He who became the Master Therion was once confronted by this very
difficulty. Being determined to instruct mankind, He sought a simple
statement of his object. His will was sufficiently informed by common
sense to décidé him to teach man T he Nexi Step, the thing which was
immediately above him. He might hâve called this “God”, or “The Higher
Self”, or “The Augoeides”, or “Adi-Buddha”, or 61 other things —but He
had discovered that these w’ere ali one, yet that each one represented
some theory of the Universe which would ultimately be shattered by
criticism — for He had already passed through the realm of Reason, and
knew that every statement contained an absurdity. He therefore said:
“Let me déclaré this Work under this title: ’The obtaining of the
Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian AngeP”, because the
theory implied in these words is so patently absurd that only simpletons
would waste much time in analysing it. It would be accepted as a
convention, and no one would incur the grave danger of building a
philosophical system upon it.</p>
<p>With this understanding, we may rehabilitate the Hebrew System of
invocations. The mind is the great enemy; so, by invoking
enthusiastically a person whom we know not to exist, we are rebuking
that mind. Yet we should not refrain altogether from philosophising in
the light of the Holy Qabalah. We should accept the Magical Hierarchy as
a more or less con- venient classification of the facts of the Universe
as they are</p>

<p>20</p>

increase, so should we endeavour to adjust our idea of what we mean by

<p>At the same time let us reflect that there is a certain definite
consensus of expérience as to the corrélation of the various beings of
the hierarchy with the observed facts of Magick.</p>
<p>In the simple matter of astral vision, for example, one striking case
may be quoted.</p>
<p>Without telling him what it was, the Master Therion once recited as
an invocation Sappho’s “Ode to Venus” before a Proba- tioner of the A.-.
A. who was ignorant of Greek, the language of the Ode. The disciple then
went on an “astral journey,” and everything seen by him was without
exception harmonious with Venus. This was true down to the smallest
detail. He even obtained ail the four colour-scales of Venus with
absolute correctness. Considering that he saw something like one hundred
symbols in ail, the odds against coincidence are incalculably great.
Such an expérience (and the records of the A.’. A.*, contain dozens cf
similar cases) alfords proof as absolute as any proof can be in this
world of Illusion that the correspondences in Liber 777 really represent
facts in Nature.</p>
<p>It suggests itself that this “straightforward” System of magick was
perhaps never really employed at ail. One might maintain that the
invocations which hâve corne down to us are but the ruins of the Temple
of Magick. The exorcisms might hâve been committed to writing for the
purpose of memorising them, while it was forbidden to make any record of
the really important parts of the ceremony. Such details of Ritual as we
possess are meagre and unconvincing, and though much success h as been
attained in the quite conventional exoteric way both by Frater Perdu-
rabo and by many of his colleagues, yet ceremonies of this character
hâve always remained tedious and difficult. It lias seemed as if the
success were obtained almost in spite of the ceremony. In any case, they
are the more mysterious parts of the Ritual which hâve evoked the divine
force. Such conjurations as those of the “Goetia” leave one cold,
although, notably in the second conjuration, there is a crude attempt to
use that formula of Commémoration of which we spoke in the preceding
Chapter.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>The Formula of Tetragrammaton. 1</p>
<p>This formula is of most universal aspect, as ail things are
necessarily comprehended in it$ but its use in a magical ceremony is
little understood.</p>
<p>The climax of the formula is in one sense before even the formulation
of the Yod. For the Yod is the most divine aspect of the Force —the
remaining letters are but a solidification of the same thing. It must be
understood that we are here speaking of the whole ceremony considered as
a unity, not merely of that formula in which Yod is the God invoked, Hé
the Archangel, and so on. In order to understand the ceremony under this
formula, we must take a more extended view of the functions of the four
weapons than we hâve hitherto done.</p>
<p>The formation of the Yod is the formulation of the first créative
force, of that father who is called “self-begotten ,? , and unto whom it
is said: &lt;c Thou hast formulated thy Father, and made fertile thy
Mother”. The adding of the Hé to the Yod is the marriage of that Father
to the great co-equal Mother, who is a reflection of Nuit as He is of
Hadit. Their union brings forth the son Vau who is the heir. Finally the
daughter Hé is produced. She is both the twin sister and the daughter of
Vau. 2</p>
<p>His mission is to redeem her by making her his bride -, the resuit of
this is to set her upon the throne of her mother, and it is only she
whose youthful embrace can reawaken the eld of the</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>mm ; Yod, Hé, Yau, Hé, the Ineffable Name (Jéhovah) of the Hebrews.
The four letters refer respectively to the four “éléments”, Fire, Water,
Air, Earth, in the order named.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . There is a further mystery herein, far deeper, for initiâtes.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>All-Father. In this complex family relationship 1 is sym¬ bolisée!
the whole course of the Universe. It will be seen that (after ail) the
Climax is at the end. It is the second half of the formula which
symbolises the Great Work which we are pledged to accomplish. The first
step of this is the attainment of th^ Knowledge and Conversation of the
Holy Guardian Angel, which constitutes the Adept of the Inner Order.</p>
<p>The re-entry of these twin spouses into the womb of the mother is
that initiation described in Libe»* 418, which gives admission to the
Inmost Order of the A.<em>. A.</em>. Of the last step we cannot
speak.</p>
<p>It will now be recognised that to devise a practical magical ceremony
to correspond to Tetragrammaton in this exalted sense might be difficult
if not impossible. In such a ceremony the Rituals of purification alone
might occupy many incarnations.</p>
<p>It will be necessary, therefore, to revert to the simpler view of
Tetragrammaton, remembering only that the Hé final is the Throne of the
Spirit, of the Shin of Pentagrammaton.</p>
<p>The Yod will represent a swift and violent créative energy; following
this will be a calmer and more reflective but even more powerful flow of
will, the irrésistible force of a mighty river. This State of mind will
be foliowed by an expansion of the consciousness ; it will penetrate ail
space, and this will finally undergo a crystallization resplendent with
interior light. Such modifications of the original Will may be observed
in the course of the invocations when they are properly performed.</p>
<p>The peculiar dangers of each are obvious — that of the first is a
flash in the pan — a misfire; that of the second, a falling into
dreaminess or reverie; that of the third, loss of concentration. A
mistake in any of these points will prevent, or injure the proper
formation of, the fourth.</p>
<p>In the expression which will be used in Chapter XV: “Enflame
thyself”, etc., only the first stage is specified; but if that is
properly done the other stages will follow as if by necessity. So far is
it written concerning the formula of Tetragrammaton.</p>
<p>I. The formula of Tetragrammaton, as ordinarily understood, ending
with the appearance of the daughter, is indeed a dégradation.</p>
<p>23 —</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>The Formula of Alhim, and that of Alim.</p>
<p>A LH IM (Elohim) is the exoteric word for Gods. 1 It is the masculine
plural of a féminine noun, but its nature is principally féminine. 2 It
is a perfect hieroglyph of the number 5. This should be studied in “A
Note on Genesis” (Equinox LU).</p>
<p>The Eléments are ail represented, as in Tetragrammaton, but there is
no development from one into the others. They are, as it were, thrown
together — untamed, only sympathising by virtue of their wild and stormy
but elastically resistless energy. The Central letter is Hé — the letter
of breath — and represents Spirit. The first letter Àleph is the natural
letter of Air, and the Final Mem is the natural letter of Water.
Together, Aleph and Mem make Am — the mother within whose womb the
Cosmos is conceived. But Yod is not the natural letter of Fire. Its
juxta¬ position with Hé sanctifies that fire to the Yod of
Tetragrammaton. Similarly we find Lamed for Earth, where we should
expect Tau — in order to emphasize the influence of Venus, who rules
Libra.</p>
<p>ALHIMy therefore, represents rather the formula of Consécra¬ tion
than that of a complété ceremony. It is the breath of bénédiction, yet
so potent that it can give life to clay and light to darkness.</p>
<p>In consecrating a weapon, Aleph is the whirling force of the
thunderbolt, the lightning which flameth out of the East even</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Gods” are the Forces of Nature; their “Names” are the Laws of
Nature. Thus They are eternal, omnipotent, omniprésent and so on; and
thus their “Wills” are immutable and absolute.</li>
</ol>
<p>• 2. It represents Sakti, or Teh; femininity always means form,
mani¬</p>
<p>festation. The masculine Siva, or Tao, is always a concealed
force.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>into the West. This is the gift of the wielding of the thunderbolt of
Zeus or Indra, the God of Air. Lamed is the Ox-goad, the driving force;
and it is also the Balance, representing the truth and love of the
Magician. It is the loving care which he bestows upon perfecting his
instruments, and the équilibration of that fierce force which initiâtes
the ceremony  </p>
<p>Yod is the créative energy — the procreative power ; and yet Yod is
the solitude and silence of the hermitage into which the Magician has
shut himself. Mem is the letter of Water, and it is the Mem final, whose
long fiat lines suggest the Sea at peace □ ; not the ordinary (initial
and médial) Mem whose hieroglyph is a wave 2 And then, in the Centre of
ail, broods Spirit, which combines the mildness of the Lamb with the
horns of the Ram, and is the letter of Bacchus or “Christ”. 8</p>
<p>After the magician has created his instrument, and balanced it truly,
and filled it with the lightnings of his Will, then is the weapon laid
away to rest; and in this Silence, a true Consécra¬ tion cornes.</p>
<p>The Formula of Alim</p>
<p>It is extremely interesting to contrast with the above the for¬ mula
of the elemental Gods deprived of the créative spirit. One</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The letters Aleph and Lamed are infinitely important in this Aeon
of Horus; they are indeed the Key of the Book of the Law. No more can be
said in this place that that Aleph is Harpocrates, Bacchus Diphues, the
Holy Ghost, the “Pure Fool” or Innocent Babe who is also the Wandering
Singer who imprégnâtes the King’s Daughter with Himself as Her Child;
Lamed is the King’s Daughter, satisfied by Him, holding His “Sword and
Balances” in her lap. These weapons are the Judge, armed with power to
execute His Will, and Two Witnesses “in whom shall every Truth be
established” in accordance with whose testimony he gives
judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>In the symbolism above outlined, Yod is the Mercurial “Virgin
Word”, the Spermatozoon concealing its light under a cloke; and Mem is
the amniotic fluid, the flood wherein is the Life-bearing Ark. See A.
Crowley “The Ship”, Equinox I, X.</p></li>
<li><p>The letter Hé is the formula of Nuith, which makes possible the
process described in the previous notes. But it is not permissible here
to explain fully the exact matter or manner of this adjustment. I hâve
preferred the exoteric attributions, which are sufficiently informative
for the beginner.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>25</p>
<p>might suppose that, as ALIM is the masculine plural of the masculine
noun AL, its formula wouîd be more virile than that of ALHIM, which is
the masculine plural of the féminine noun ALH. A moments investigation
is sufficient to dissipate the illusion. The Word masculine has no
meaning except in relation to some féminine corrélative.</p>
<p>The word ALIM may in fact be considered as neuter. By a rather absurd
convention, neuter objects are treated as féminine on account of their
superficial resemblance in passivity and inertness with the unfertilized
female. But the female produces life by the intervention of the male,
while the neuter does so only when impregnated by Spirit. Thus we find
the féminine AM A becoming AIMA 1 through the operation of the phallic
Yod, while ALIM, the congress of dead éléments, only fructifies by the
brooding of Spirit.</p>
<p>This being so, how can we describe ALIM as containing a Magical
formula ? Inquiry discloses the fact that this formula is of a very
spécial kind.</p>
<p>The word adds up to 81, which is a number of the moon. It is thus the
formula of witchcraft, which is under Hecate 2 . It is only the romantic
mediaeval perversion of science that represents young women as partaking
in witchcraft, which is, properly speaking, restricted to the use of
such women as are no longer women in the Magical sense of the word,
because they are no longer capable of corresponding to the formula of
the male, and are therefore neuter rather than féminine. It is for this
reason that their method has always been referred to the moon, in that
sense of the term in which she appears, not as the féminine corré¬
lative of the sun, but as the burnt-out, dead, airless satellite of
earth.</p>
<p>No true Magical operation can be performed by the formula</p>
<p>of ALIM. Ail the works of witchcraft are illusory; and their apparent
effects dépend on the idea that it is possible to aiter things by the
mere rearrangement of them. One</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>AMA is 42, the number of sterility; AIMA, 52, that of fertility,

</ol>
<p>26</p>
<p>must not rely upon the false analogy of the Xylenes to rebut this
argument. It is quite true that geometrical isomers act in différent
manners towards the substances to which they are brought into relation.
And it is of course necessary sometimes to rearrange the éléments of a
molécule before that molécule can form either the masculine or the
féminine element in a true Magical combination with some other
molécule.</p>
<p>It is therefore occasionally inévitable for a Magician to re-
organize the structure of certain éléments before proceeding to his
operation proper. Although such work is technically witch- craft, it
must not be regarded as undesirable on that ground, for ail operations
which do not transmute matter fall strictly speaking under this
heading.</p>
<p>The real objection to this formula is not inhérent in its own nature.
Witchcraft consists in treating it as the exclusive préoc¬ cupation of
Magick, and especially in denying to the Holy Spirit his right to
indwell His Temple. 1</p>
<p>I. The initiate of the XI 0 of O. T. O. will remark that there is a
totaliy different formula of ALIM, complementary with that here
discussed. 8 l may be regarded as a number of Yesod rather than of Luna.
The actual meaning of the word may be taken as indicating the formula.
Aleph may be referred to Harpocrates, with allusion to the well-known
poem of Catullus. Lamed may imply the exaltation of Saturn, and suggest
the Three of Swords in a particular manner. Yod will then recall Hermes,
and Mem the Hanged Man. We hâve thus a Tetragrammaton which contains no
féminine component. The initial Force is here the Holy Spirit and its
vehicle or weapon the “Sword and Balances . Justice is then done upon
the Mercurial “Virgin”, with the resuit that the Man is “Hanged” or
extended, and is slain in this manner. Such an operation makes création
impossible — as in the former case; but here there is no question of
re-arrangement; the Creative force is employed deliberately for
destruction, and is entirely absorbed in its own sphere (or cylinder, on
Einstein’s équations) of action. This Work is to be regarded as Holiness
to the Lord”. The Hebrews, in fact, conferred the title of Qadosh (holy)
upon its adepts. Its effect is to consecrate the Magicians who perforai
it in a very spécial wav. We may take note also of the correspond¬ ance
of Nine with Teth, XI, Léo, and the Serpent. The great merits of this
formula are that it avoids contact with the inferior planes, that it is
self-sufhcient, that it involves no responsibilities, and that it leaves
its masters not only stronger in themselves, but wholly free to fulfil
their essential Natures. Its abuse is an abomination.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>CBAPTER V</p>
<p>The Formula of I.A.O.</p>
<p>This formula is the principal and most characteristic formula of
Osiris, of the Rédemption of Mankind. I is Isis, Nature, ruined by A ,
Apophis the Destroyer, and restored to life by the Redeemer Osiris. 1
The sanie idea is expressed by the Rosicrucian formula of the
Trinity:</p>
<p>Ex Deo nas ci mur.</p>
<p>In Je su morimur .</p>
<p>Per Sfiritum Sanctum reviviscimus .</p>
<p>This is also identical with the Word Lux L.V.X., which is formed by
the arrns of a cross. It is this formula which is implied in those
ancient and modem monuments in which the phallus is worshipped as the
Saviour of the World.</p>
<p>The doctrine of résurrection as vulgarly understood is false and
absurd. It is not even “Scriptural”. St. Paul does not identify the
glorified body which rises with the mortal body which dies. On the
contrary, he repeatedly insists on the distinction.</p>
<p>The same is true of a magical ceremony. The magician who is destroyed
by absorption in the Godhead is really destroyed. The</p>
<p>I. There is a quite different formula in which I is the Father, O the
Mother, A the child — and yet another, in which I. A. O. are ail fathers
of different kir.ds balanced by H. H. H., 3 Mothers, to complété the
Universe. In a third, the true formula of the Beast 666, I and O are îhe
opposites which form the field for the operation of A. But this is a
higher matter unsuited for this eîementary handbook. See, however, Liber
Samekh, Point II, Section J.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>misérable mortal automaton remains in the Circle. It is of no more
conséquence to Him than the dust of the floor. 1</p>
<p>But before entering into the details of LA.O. as a magick formula it
should be remarked that it is essentially the formula of Yoga or
méditation; in fact, of elementary mysticism in ail its branches.</p>
<p>In beginning a méditation practice, there is always 2 a quiet
pleasure, a gentle natural growth; one takes a lively interest in the
work; it seems easy; one is quite pleased to hâve started. This stage
represents Isis. Sooner or later it is suc- ceeded by dépréssion -— the
Dark Night of the Soûl, an infinité weariness and détestation of the
work. The simplest and easiest acts become almost impossible to perform.
Such impotence fills the mind with appréhension and despair. The
intensity of this loathing can hardly be understood by any person who
has not experienced it. This is the period of Apophis.</p>
<p>It is followed by the arising not of Isis, but of Osiris. The ancient
condition is not restored, but a new and superior condition is created,
a condition only rendered possible by the process of death.</p>
<p>The Alchemists themselves taught this same truth. The first matter of
the work was base and primitive, though “natural”. After passing through
various stages the “black dragon” appeared; but from this arose the pure
and perfect gold.</p>
<p>Even in the legend of Prometheus we find an identical formula
concealed; and a similar remark applies to those of Jésus Christ, and of
many other mythical god-men worshipped in different</p>
<p>countries. 3</p>
<p>A magical ceremony constructed on this formula is thus in close
essential harmony with the natural mystic process. We find it the</p>

<p>basis of many important initiations, notably the Third degree in
Masonry, and the 5®— 6 ° ceremony of the G.D. described in Equinox I,
III. A cérémonial self-initiation may be constructed with advantage on
this formula. The essence of it consists in robing yourself as a king,
then stripping and slaying vourself, and rising from that death to the
Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel  There is an
etymological identitv between Tetragrammaton and I A 0 9 but the m agi
cal formulæ are entirely different, as the descriptions here given hâve
schewn.</p>
<p>Professor William James, in his “Varieties of Religious Expérience”,
has well classified religion as the &lt;£ once~born” and the
“twice-born”; but the religion now proclaimed in Liber Legis harmonizes
these by transcending them. There is no attempt to get rid of death by
denying it, as among the once-born; nor to accept death as the gâte of a
new life, as among the twice-born. With the A.<em>. A.</em>, life and
death are equally incidents in a career, very much like day and night in
the history of a planet. But, to pursue the simile, we regard this
planet from afar. A Brother of A.<em>. A.</em>, looks at (what another
person would call) “him- self”, as one — or, rallier, sonie — among a
group of phenomena. He is that “nothing” whose consciousness is in one
sense the universe considered as a single phenomenon in time and space,
and in another sense is the négation of that consciousness. The body and
mind of the man are only important (if at ail) as the telescope of the
astronomer to him. If the telescope were destroyed it would make no
appréciable différence to the Universe which that telescope reveals.</p>
<p>It will now be understood that this formula of I A O is a formula of
Tiphareth. The magician who employa it is conscious of himself as a man
liable to suffering, and anxious to transcend that state by becoming one
with God. It will appear to him as the Suprême Ritual, as the final
stepj but, as has already been</p>
<p>I. This formula, although now superseded by that of HORUS, the
Crowned and Conquering Child, remains valid for those who hâve not yet
assimilated the point of view of the Law of Thelema. But see Appendix,
Liber SAMEKH. Compare also “The Book of the Spirit of the Living Gods,”
where there is a ritual given in extenso on slightly different lines:
Equinox I, III, pages 269-272.</p>
<p>— 30</p>
<p>pointée! out, it is but a preliminary. For the normal man to-day,
however, it represents considérable attainment; and there is a much
earlier formula whose investigation will occupy Chapter VI.</p>
<p>The Master Therion, in the Seventeenth year of the Aeon, has
reconstructed the Word I A O to satisfy the new conditions of Magick
imposed by progress. The Word of the Law being Thelema, whose number is
93, this number should be the canon of a corresponding Mass.
Accordingly, he Has expanded I A O by treating the O as an Ayin, and
then adding Vau as prefix and affix. The full Word is then</p>
<p>wn</p>
<p>whose number is 93. We may analyse this new Word in detail and
demonstrate that it is a proper hieroglyph of the Ritual of
Self-Initiation in this Aeon of Horus. For the correspondence in the

<p>Aeon of his . Matriarchal Age. The Great Work conceived as a
straightforward simple affair.</p>
<p>We find the theory reflected in the customs of Matriarchy.
Parthenogenesis is supposed to be true. The Virgin (Yod-Virgo) contains
in herself the Principle of Growth — the epicene Her- metic seed. It
becornes the Babe in the Egg (A — Harpocrates) by virtue of the Spirit
(A = Air, impregnating the Mother- Vulture) and this becomes the Sun or
Son (F = the letter of Tiphareth, 6, even when spelt as Oméga, in
Coptic. See 777).</p>
<p>Aeon of Osiris. Patriarchal âge. Two sexes. I conceived as the
Father-Wand. (Yod in Tetragrammaton). A The Babe is pursued by the
Dragon, who casts a flood from his mouth to swallow it. See Rev. VIL The
Dragon is also the Mother — the “Evil Mother” of Freud. It iâ
Harpocrates, threatened by the crocodile in the Nile. We find the
symbolism of the Ark, the Coffin of Osiris, etc. The Lotus is the Yoni;
the Water the Amniotic Fluid. In order to live his own life, the child
must leave the Mother, and overcome the temptation to return to her for
refuge. Kundry, Armida, Jocasta, Circe, etc., are svmbols of this force
Which tempts the Hero. He may take her as his servant 1 when he has
mastered her, so as to heal his father (Amfortas), avenge him (Osiris),
or pacify him (Jéhovah). But in order to grow to manhood, he must cease
to dépend on her, earning the Lance (Parzival), claiming his arms
(Achilles), or making his club (Hercules) 2 , and wander in the
waterless wilderness like Krishna, Jésus, Oedipus, x. t. A. — until the
hour when, as the “King’s Son” or knight-errant, he must win the
Princess, and set himself upon a strange throne. Almost ail the legends
of heroes imply this formula in strikingly similar symbols. F. Vau the
Sun — Son. He is supposed to be mortal ; but how is this shewn? It seems
an absolute perversion of truth: the sacred symbols hâve no hint of it.
This lie is the essence of the Great Sorcery. Osirian religion is a
Freudian phantasy fashioned of man’s dread of death and ignorance of
nature. The partheno-</p>

<p>O The exalted “Devil” (also the other secret Eye) by the formula of
the Initiation of Horus elsewhere described in detail. This “Devil” is
called Satan or Shaitan, and regarded with horror by people who are
ignorant of his formula, and, imagining themselves to be evil, accuse
Nature herself of their own phantasmal crime. Satan is Saturn, Set,
Abrasax, Adad, Adonis, Attis, Adam, Adonai, etc. The most serious charge
against him is only that he is the Sun in the South. The Ancient

<p>dwelling as they did in lands whose blood was the water of thé Nile
or the Euphrates, connectée! the South with life-withering heat ? and
cursed that quarter where the solar darts were deadliest. Even in the
legend of Hiram, it is at high noon that he is stricken down and slain.
Capricornus is moreover the sign which the Sun enters when he reaches
his extreme Southern déclination at the Winter Solstice, the season of
the death of végétation, for the folk of the Northern hemisphere. This
gave them a second cause for cursing the South. A third; the tyranny of
hot, dry, poisonous windsj the menace of deserts or océans dreadful
because mysterious and impassable; these also were connected in their
minds with the South. But to us, aw^are of astronomical facts, this
antagonism to the South is a silly superstition which the accidents of
their local conditions suggested to our animistic ancestors. We see no
enmitv between Right and Left, Up and Down, and similar pairs of
opposites. These antithèses are real only as a statement of relation;
they are the conventions of an arbitrary device for representing our
icleas in a pluralistic symbolism based on duality. “Good” must be
defined in terms of human ideals and instincts. “East” has no meaning
except with reference to the earth’s internai aff airs ; as an absolute
direction in space it changes a degree every four minutes. “Up” is the
same for no two men, unless one chance to be in the line joining the
other with the centre of the earth. “Hard” is the private opinion of our
muscles. “True” is an utterly unintelligible epithet which has proved
refractory to the analysis of our ablest philosophers.</p>
<p>We hâve therefore no scruple in restoring the “devil-worship” of such
ideas as those which the laws of sound, and the phenomena of speech and
hearing, compel us to connect with the group of “Gods” whose names are
based upon ShT or D, vocalized by the free breath A. For these Names
imply the qualifies of courage, frankness, energy, pride, power and
triumph; they are the words which express the créative and paternal
will.</p>
<p>Thus “the Devil” is Capricornus, the Goat who leaps upon the loftiest
mountains, the Godhead which, if it become manifest in man, makes him
Aegipan, the Ail.</p>
<p>The Sun enters this sign when he turns to renew the year in the
North. He is also the vowel O, proper to roar, to boom, and</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>to command, being a forcible breath controlled by the firm circle of
the mouth.</p>
<p>He is the Open Eye of the exalted Sun, before whom ail shadows flee
away: also that Secret Eye which makes an image of its God, the Light,
and gives it power to utter oracles, enlightening the mind.</p>
<p>Thus, he is Man made God, exalted, eager; he has corne consciously to
his full stature, and so is ready to set out on his journey to redeem
the world. But he may not appear in this true form; the Vision of Pan
would drive men mad with fear. He must conceal Himself in his original
guise.</p>
<p>He therefore becomes apparently the man that he was at the beginning;
he lives the life of a man; indeed, he is wholly man. But his initiation
has made him master of the Event by giving him the understanding that
whatever happens to him is the execution of his true will. Thus the last
stage of his initiation is expressed in our formula as the final:</p>
<p>F — The sériés of transformations has not affected his identity; but
it has explained him to himself. Similarly, Copper is still Copper after
Cu 4-0 = CuO : -h H 2 S0 4 = CuS.Oi^O): -h K 2 S = CuS(K 2 S0 4 ) l 4-
blowpipe and reducing agent</p>
<p>= Cu(S).</p>
<p>It is the same copper; but we hâve learnt some of its properties. We
observe especially that it is indestructible, inviolably itself
throughout ail its adventures, and in ail its disguises. We see moreover
that it can only make use of its powers, fulfil the possi¬ bilités of
its nature, and satisfy its équations, by thus combining with its
counterparts. Its existence as a separate substance is evidence of its
subjection to stress; and this is felt as the ache of an
incompréhensible yearning until it réalisés that every expérience is a
relief, an expression of itself; and that it cannot be injured by aught
that may befall it. In the Aeon of Osiris it was indeed’ realised that
Man must die in order to live. But now in the Aeon of Horus we know that
every event is a death; subject and object slay each other in “love
under will”; each such death is itself life, the means by which one
réalisés oneself in a sériés of épisodes.</p>
<p>The second main point is the completion of the A babe Bacchus by the
O Pan (Parzival wins the Lance, etc.).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>The first process is to find the I in the V — initiation, purifica¬
tion, finding the Secret Root of oneself, the epicene Virgin who is io
(Malkuth) but spelt in fui! 20 (Jupiter).</p>
<p>This Yod in the Virgin expands to the Babe in the Egg by formulating
the Secret Wisdom of Truth of Hermes in the Silence of the Fool. He
acquires the Eye-Wand, beholding and acting and being adored. The
Inverted Pentagram — Baphomet — the Hermaphrodite fully grown — begets
himself on himself as V again.</p>
<p>Note that there are now two sexes in one person throughout, so that
each individual is self-procreative sexually, whereas Isis knew only one
sex, and Osiris thought the two sexes opposed. Also the formula is now
Love in ail cases; and the end is the beginning, on a higher plane.</p>
<p>The I is formed from the V by removing its tail, the A by balancing 4
Yods, the O by making an inverted triangle of Yods, which suggests the
formula of Nuit — Hadit — Ra-Hoor-Khuit. A is the éléments whirling as a
Svastika — the créative Energy in equilibrated action.</p>
<p>3 »</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>The Formula of the Néophyte  </p>
<p>This formula has for its “first matter” the ordinary man entirely
ignorant of everything and incapable of anything. He is therefore
represented as blindfolded and bound. His only aid is his aspira¬ tion,
represented by the officer who is to lead him into the Temple. Before
entering, he must be purified and consecrated. Once within the Temple,
he is required to bind himself by an oath. His aspiration is now
formulated as Will. He makes the mystic circumambulation of the Temple
for the reasons to be described in the Chapter on “Gesture”. After
further purification and consécra¬ tion, he is allowed for one moment to
see the Lord of the West, and gains courage 1 2 to persist. For the
third time he is purified and consecrated, and he sees the Lord of the
East, who holds the balance, keeping him in a straight line. In the West
he gains energy. In the East he is prevented from dissipating the same.
So fortified, he may be received into the order as a néophyte by the
three principal officers, thus uniting the Cross with the Triangle. He
may then be placed between the pillars of the Temple, to receive the
fourth and final consécration. In this position the secrets of the grade
are communicated to him, and the last of his fetters is removed. Ail
this is sealed by the sacrament of the Four Eléments.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the effect of this whole ceremony is to endow a
thing inert and impotent with balanced motion in a given direction.
Numerous examples of this formula are given</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See the Néophyte Ceremony, Equinox I, II.</p></li>
<li><p>Fear is the source of ail false perception. Even Freud had a
glimpse of this fact.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>39</p>
<p>in Equinox I, Nos. II and III. It is the formula of the Néophyte
Ceremony of G.D. It should be employed in the consécration of the actual
weapons usecl by the magician, and may also be used as the first formula
of initiation.</p>
<p>In the book called Z 2 1 (Equinox I, III) are given full details of
this formula, which cannot be too carefully studied and practised. It is
unfortunately, the most complex of ail of them. But this is the fault of
the first matter of the work, which is so muddled that many operations
are required to unify it.</p>
<ol type="i">

grotesque rubbish in the îatter case, and in the former obscure and

<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>The Formula of the Holy Graal:</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>Abrahadabra: and of certain other Words.</p>
<p>Also : The Magicai. Memory.</p>
<p>The Hieroglyph shewn in the Seventh Key of the Tarot (des- cribed in
the I2th Aethyr, Liber 418, Equinox I, V) is the Charioteer of Our Lady
Babalon, whose Cup or Graal he bears.</p>
<p>Now this is an important formula. It is the First of the Formulæ, in
a sense, for it is the formula of Renunciation. 1 2 It is also the Last
!</p>
<p>This Cup is said to be full of the Blood of the Saints ; that is,</p>
<p>every “sainC’ or magician must give the last drop of his life’s blood
to tliat cup. It is the original price paid for magick power. And if by
magick power we mean the true power, the assimilation of ail force with
the Ultimate Light, the true Bridai of the Rosy Cross, then is that
blood the offering of Virginity, the sole sacrifice well-pleasing to the
Master, the sacrifice whose only reward is the pain of child-bearing
unto him.</p>
<p>But “to sell one’s soûl to the devil”, to renounce no matter what for
an équivalent in personal gain % is hlack magic. You are no longer a
noble giver of your ail, but a mean huckster.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is no moral implication here. But to choose A implies to
refuse not-A: at least, that is so, below the Abyss.</p></li>
<li><p>Supfosed personal gain. There is really no person to gain; so the
whole transaction is a swindle on both sides.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This formula is, however, a little different in symbolism, since it
is a Woman whose Cup must be filled. It is rather the sacrifice of the
Man, who transfers life to his descendants. For a woman does not carry
in herself the principle of new life, except tem- porarily, when it is
given her.</p>
<p>But here the formula implies much more even than this. For it is his
whole life that the Magus offers to Our Lady. The Cross is both Death
and Génération, and it is on the Cross that the Rose blooms. The full
significance of these symbols is so lofty that it is hardly fitted for
an elementary treatise of this type. One must be an Exempt Adept, and
hâve become ready to pass on, before one can see the symbols even from
the lower plane. Only a Master of the Temple can fully understand
them.</p>
<p>(However, the reader may study Liber CLVI in Equinox I, VI, the I2th
and 2nd Aethyrs in Liber 418 in Equinox I, V, and the Symbolism of the
V° and VI° in O.T.O.)</p>
<p>Of the préservation of this blood which Our Lady offers to the
Ancient one, Chaos 1 the All-Father, to revive him, and of how his
divine Essence fills the Daughter (the soûl of Man) and places her upon
the Throne of the Mother, fulfilling the Economy of the Universe, and
thus ultimately rewarding the Magician (the Son) ten thousandfold, it
would be still more improper to speak in this place. So holy a mystery
is the Arcanum of the Masters of the Temple, that it is here hinted at
in order to blind the presumptuous who may, unworthy, seek to lift the
veil, and at the same time to lighten the darkness of such as may be
requiring only one ray of the Sun in order to spring into life and
light.</p>
<p>Il</p>
<p>Abrahadabra is a Word to be studied in Equinox I, V., a The Temple of
Solomon the King”. It represents the Great Work complété, and it is
therefore an archétype of ail lesser magical operations. It is in a way
too perfect to be applied in</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Chaos is a general name for the totality of the Units of Existence;
it is thus a name féminine in form. Each unit of Chaos is itself All-
Father.</li>
</ol>
<p>42</p>
<p>advance to any of them. But an example of such an operation may be
studied in Equinox I, VII, “The Temple of Solomon the King”, where an
invocation of Horus on this formula is given in full. Note the
réverbération of the ideas one against another. The formula of Horus has
not yet been so fully worked out in details as to justify a treatise
upon its exoteric theory and practice; but one may say that it is, to
the formula of Osiris, what the turbine is to the reciprocating
engine.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>There are many other sacred words which enshrine formulæ of great
efficacity in particular operations.</p>
<p>For example, V.I.T.R.I.O.L gives a certain Regimen of the Planets
useful in Alchemical work. Ararita is a formula of the macrocosm potent
in certain very lofty Operations of the Magick of the Inmost Light. (See
Liber 813.)</p>
<p>The formula of Thelema may be summarized thus: Q “Babalon and The
Beast conjoined” — £ unto Nuith (CCXX, 1, 51) — A The Work accomplished
in Justice — y) the Holy Graal — p. The Water therein — a The Babe in
the Egg (Harpocrates on the Lotus.)</p>
<p>That of Agape is as follows:</p>
<p>Dionysus (Capital A) — The Virgin Earth y — The Babe in the Egg
(small a — the image of the Father) — The Massacre of the Innocents, tz
(winepress) — The Draught of Ecstasy, y).</p>
<p>The student will find it well worth his while to seek out these ideas
in detail, and develop the technique of their application.</p>
<p>There is also the Gnostic Name of the Seven Vowels, which gives a
musical formula most puissant in évocations of the Soûl of Nature. There
is moreover ABRAXAS; there is XNOUBIS; there is MEITHRAS; and indeed it
may briefly be stated that every true name of God gives the formula of
the invocation of that God. 1 It would therefore be impossible, even
were it désirable, to analyse ail such names. The general method of
doing so has been</p>
<p>I. Members of the IV° of the O. T. O . are well aware of a Magick
Word whose analysis contains ail Truth, human and Divine, a Word indeed
potent for any group which dares to use it.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>given, and the magician must himself work out his own formula for
particular cases. 1</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It should also be remarked that every grade bas its peculiar magical
formula. Thus, the formula of Abrahadabra concerns us, as men,
principally because each of us represents the pentagram or microcosm ;
and our équilibration must therefore be with the hexa- gram or
macrocosm. In other words, 5 0 = 6° is the formula of the Solar
operation $ but then 6°=5° is the formula of the Martial operation, and
this reversai of the figures implies a very different Work. In the
former instance the problem was to dissolve the microcosm in the
macrocosm 5 but this other problem is to separate a particular force
from the macrocosm, just as a savage might hew out a flint axe from the
deposits in a chalk cliff. Similarly, an operation of Jupiter will be of
the nature of the équilibration of him with Venus. Its graphie formula
will be 7°=4°, and there will be a Word in which the character of this
operation is described, just as Abrahadabra describes the Operation of
the Great Work.</p>
<p>It may be stated without unfairness, as a rough general principie,
that the farther from original equality are the two sides of the
équation, the more difficult is the operation to perform.</p>
<p>Thus, to take the case of the personal operation symbolized by the
grades, it is harder to become a Néophyte, i° = io°, than to pass from
that grade to Zelator, 2° = 9 0 .</p>
<p>Initiation is, therefore, progressively easier, in a certain sense,
after the first step is taken. But (especially after the passing of
Tiphareth) the distance between grade and grade increases as it were by
a geometrical progression with an enormously high factor, which itself
progresses. 2</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Holy Qabalah (see Liber D in Eqiiinox I, VIII, Supplément,
and Liber 777) affords the means of analysis and application required.
See also Equinox I, V, “The Temple of Solomon The King”.</p></li>
<li><p>A suggestion has recently been made that the Hierarchy of the
Grades should be “destroyed, and replaced by”—a ring System of 13 grades
ail equal. There is, of course, one sense in which every grade is a Th
in g-in-Itself. But the Hierarchy is only a convenient method</p></li>
</ol>
<p>44</p>
<p>It is evidently impossible to give details of ail these formulæ.
Before beginning any operation soever the magician must make a thorough
Qabalistic study of it so as to work out its theory in symmetry of
perfection. Preparedness in Magick is as important as it is in War.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>It should be profitable to make a somewhat detailed study of the
strange-looking word AUMGN, for its analysis affords an excellent
illustration of the principles on which the Practicus may construct his
own Sacred Words.</p>
<p>This word has been uttered by the Master Therion himself, as a means
of declaring his own personal work as the Beast, the Logos of the Aeon.
To understand it, we must make a preliminary considération of the word
which it replaces and from which it was developed: the word AUM.</p>
<p>The word AUM is the sacred Hindu mantra which was the suprême
hieroglyph of Truth, a compendium of the Sacred Knowledge. Many volumes
hâve been written with regard to it j but, for our présent purpose, it
will be necessary only to explain how it came to serve for the
représentation of the principal philosophical tenets of the Rishis.</p>
<p>of classifying observed facts. One is reminded of the Democracy, who,
on being informed by the Minister of the Interior that the scarcity of
provisions was due to the Law of Supply and Demand, passed a unanimous
resolution calling for the immédiate repeal of that iniquitous
measure!</p>
<p>Every person, whatever his grade in the Order, has also a “natural”
grade appropriate to his intrinsic virtue. He may expect to be “cast
out” into that grade when he becomes 8° = 3 0 . Thus one man, throughout
his career, may be essentially of the type of Netzach; another, of Hod.
In the same way Rembrandt and Raphaël retained their respective points
of view in ail stages of their art. The practical considération is that
some aspirants may find it unusually difficult to attain certain grades;
or, worse, allow their inhérent prédispositions to influence them to
neglect anti- pathetic, and indulge sympathetic, types of work. They may
thus become more unbalanced than ever, with disastrous results. Success
in one’s favourite pursuit is a temptress; whose yields to her wiles
limits his own growth. True, every Will is partial; but, even so, it can
only fulfil itself by symmetrical expansion. It must be adjusted to the
Universe, or fail of perfection.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Firstly, it represents the complété course of sound. It is pro-
nounced by forcing the breath from the back of the throat with the mouth
wide open, through the buccal cavity with the lips so shaped as to
modify the sound from A to O (or U), to the closed lips, when it becomes
M. Symbolically, this announces the course of Nature as proceeding from
free and formless création through controlled and formed préservation to
the silence of destruction. The three sounds are harmonized into one;
and thus the Word represents the Hindu Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and
Shiva; and the operations in the Universe of their triune energy. It is
thus the formula of a Manvantara, or period of manifested existence,
which alternâtes with a Pralaya, during which création is latent.</p>
<p>Analysed Qabalistically, the Word is found to possess similar
properties. A is the négative, and also the unity which concentrâtes it
into a positive form. A is the Holy Spirit who begets God in flesh upon
the Virgin, according to the formula familial* to students of “The
Golden Bough”. A is also the “babe in the Egg” thus produced. The
quality of A is thus bisexual. It is the original being — Zeus
Arrhenothelus, Bacchus Diphues, or Baphomet.</p>
<p>U or V is the manifested son himself. Its number is 6. It refers
therefore, to the dual nature of the Logos as divine and human; the
interlacing of the upright and averse triangles in the hexagram. It is
the first number of the Sun, whose last number 1 is 666, “the number of
a man”.</p>
<p>The letter M exhibits the termination of this process. It is the
Hanged Man of the Tarot ; the formation of the individual from the
absolute is closed by his death.</p>
<p>We see accordingly how AUM is, on either System, the expres¬ sion of
a dogma which implies catastrophe in nature. It is cognate with the
formula of the Slain God. The “résurrection” and “ascension” are not
implied in it. They are later inventions without basis in necessity;
they may be described indeed as Freudian phantasms conjured up by the
fear of facing reality. To</p>
<p>I. The Sun being 6, a square 6X6 contains 36 squares. We arrange the
numbers fiom I to 36 in this square, so that each line, file, and
diagonal adds to the same number. This number is 111 ; the total of ail
is 666.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>the Hindu, indeed, they are still less respectable. In his view,
existence is essentially objectionable 1 2 j and his principal concern
is to invoke Shiva ” to destroy the illusion whose thrall is the curse
of the Manvantara.</p>
<p>The cardinal révélation of the Great Aeon of Horus is that this
formula AUM does not represent the facts of nature. 1 he point of view
is based upon misapprehension of the character of existence. It soon
became obvious to The Master Fherion that AUM was an inadéquate and
misleading hieroglyph. It stated only part of the truth, and it implied
a fundamental falsehood. He consequently determined to modify the Word
in such a manner as to fit it to represent the Arcana unveiled by the
Aeon of which He had attained to be the Logos.</p>
<p>The essential task was to emphasize the fact that nature is not
catastrophic, but proceeds by means of undulations. It might be
suggested that Manvantara and Pralaya are in reality com- plementary
curvesj but the Hindu doctrine insists strongly on denying continuity to
the successive phases. It was nevertheless important to avoid disturbing
the Trinitarian arrangement of the word, as would be done by the
addition of other letters. It was equally désirable to make it clear
that the letter M represents an operation which does not actually occur
in nature except as the withdrawal of phenomena into the absolute; which
process, even when so understood, is not a true destruction, but, on the
contrary, the émancipation of anything from the modifications which it
had mistaken for itself. It occurred to him that the true nature of
Silence was to permit the uninterrupted vibration of the undulatory
energy, free from the false conceptions attached to it by the Ahamkara
or Ego-making faculty, whose assumption that conscious individuality
constitutes existence led it to consider its own apparently catastrophic
character as pertaining to the order of nature.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Thelemites agréé that manifested existence implies Imperfection.
But they understand why Perfection devises this disguise. The Theory is
developed fully in Liber Aleph, and in Part IV of this Book 4. See also
Cap V Paragraph on F final of Fiaof.</p></li>
<li><p>The Vaishnava theory, superficially opposed to this, turns out on
analysis to be practically identical.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>47</p>
<p>The undulatory formula of putréfaction is represented in the Qabalah
by the letter N, which refers to Scorpio, whose triune nature combines
the Eagle, Snake and Scorpion. These hiero- glyphs themselves indicate
the spiritual formulæ of incarnation. He was also anxious to use the
letter G, another triune formula expressive of the aspects of the moon,
which further déclarés the nature of human existence in the following
manner. The moon is in itself a dark orb; but an appearance of light is
communicatec! to it by the surij and it is exactly in this way that
successive incarnations create the appearance, just as the individual
star, which every man is, remains itself, irrespective of whether earth
perceives it or not.</p>
<p>Now it so happens that the root GN signifies both knowledge and
génération combined in a single idea, in an absolute form independent of
personality. The G is a silent letter, as in oür word Gnosisj and the
sound GN is nasal, suggesting therefore the breath of life as opposed to
that of speech. Impelled by these considérations, the Master Therion
proposed to replace the M of AUM by a compound letter MGN, symbolizing
thereby jthe subtle transformation of the apparent silence and death
which terminâtes the manifested life of Vau by a continuous vibration of
an impersonal energy of the nature of génération and knowledge, the
Virgin Moon and the Serpent furthermore operating to include in the idea
a commémoration of the legend so grossly deformed in the Hebrew legend
of the Garden of Eden, and its even more malignantly debased
falsification in that bitterly sectarian broadside, the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Sound work invariably vindicates itself by furnishing confirmatory
corollaries not contemplâted by the Qabalist. In the présent instance,
the Master Therion was delighted to remark that his compound letter MGN,
constructed on theoretical principles with the idea of incorporating the
new knowledge of the Aeon, had the value of 93 (M = 40, G = 3, N = 50).
93 is the number of the word of the Law — T helema — Will, and of Agapé
-— Love, which indicates the nature of Will. It is further¬ more the
number of the Word which overcomes death, as members of the degree of
M.M. of the O.T.O. are well awarej and it is also that of the complété
formula of existence as expressed in the</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Irue Word of the Néophyte, where existence is taken to import that
phase of the whole which is the finite resolution of the Qabalistic
Zéro.</p>
<p>Finally, the total numération of the Word AUMGN is ioo, which, as
initiâtes of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the O.T.O. are taught,
expresses the unity under the form of complété mani¬ festation by the
symbolism of pure number, being Kether by Aiq Bkr 1 2 ; also Malkuth
multiplied by itself ~, and thus estab- lished in the phénoménal
universe. But, moreover, this number IOO mysteriously indicates the
Magical formula of the Universe as a reverberatory engine for the
extension of Nothingness through the device of equilibrated opposites.
3</p>
<p>It is moreover the value of the letter Qoph, which means “the back of
the head”, the cerebellum, where the créative or repro¬ ductive force is
primarily situated. Qoph in the Tarot is “the Moon”, a card suggesting
illusion, yet shewing counterpartal forces operating in darkness, and
the Winged Beetle or Midnight Sun in his Bark travelling through the
Nadir. Its Yetziratic attribution is Pisces, symbolic of the positive
and négative currents of fluidic energy, the male Ichthus or “Pesce” and
the female Vesica, seeking respectively the anode and kathode. The
number ioo is therefore a synthetic glyph of the subtle energies
employed in creating the Illusion, or Reflection of Reality, which we
call manifested existence.</p>
<p>The above are the principal considérations in the matter of AUMGN.
They should suffice to illustrate to the student the methods employed in
the construction of the hieroglyphics of Magick, and to arm him with a
mantra of terrifie power by virtue whereof he may apprehend the
Universe, and control in himself its Karmic conséquences.</p>

<p>The M agi cal Memory.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>There is no more important task than the exploration of one’s
previous incarnations  As Zoroaster says: “Explore the river of the
soûl; whence and in what order thou hast corne.” One cannot do one’s
True Will intelligently unless one knows what it is. Liber Thisarb,
Equinox I, VII, gives instructions for determining this by calculating
the résultant of the forces which hâve made one what one is. But this
practice is confined to one’s présent incarnation.</p>
<p>If one were to wake up in a boat on a strange river, it would be rash
to conclude that the direction of the one reach visible was that of the
whole stream. It would help very much if one remembered the bearings of
previous reaches traversed before one’s nap. It would further relieve
one’s anxiety when one became aware that a uniform and constant force
was the single déterminant of ail the flindings of the stream:
gravitation. We could rejoice “that even the weariest river winds
somewhere safe to sea.”</p>
<p>Liber Thisarb describes a method of obtaining the Magical Memory by
learning to remember backwards. But the careful</p>
<p>I. It has been objected to reincarnation that the population of this
planet has been increasing rapidly. Where do the new soûls corne from?
It is not necessary to invent théories about other planets; it is enough
to say that the earth is passing through a period when human units are
being built up from the éléments with increased frequency. The evidence
for this theory springs to the eye: in what other âge was there such
puerility, such lack of race-experience, such reliance upon incohérent
formulas? (Contrast the infantile emotionalism and credulity of the
average “well-educated” Anglo-Saxon with the shrewd common sense of the
normal illiterate peasant.) A large proportion of mankind to-day is
composed of “soûls’ who are living the human life for the fîrst time.
Note especially the incredible spread of congénital homosexuality and
other sexual deficiencies in many forms. These are the people who hâve
not understood, accepted, and used even the Formula of Osiris. Kin to
them are the ‘once-born’ of William James, who are incapable of
philosophy, magick, or even religion, but seek instinctively a refuge
from the horror of contemplating Nature, which they do not comprehend,
in soothing-syrup affirmations such as those of Christian Science,
Spiritualism, and ail the sham ‘occult’ creeds, as well as the
emasculated forms of so-called Christianity.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>practice of Dharana is perhaps more generally useful. As one prevents
the more accessible thoughts from arising, we strike deeper strata —
memories of childhood reawaken. Still deeper lies a class of thoughts
whose origin puzzles us. Sojne of these apparently belong to former
incarnations. By cultivating these departments of one’s mind we can
develop them; we become expert ; we form an organized cohérence of these
originally disconnected éléments ; the faculty grows with astonishing
rapidity, once the knack of the business is mastered.</p>
<p>It is much easier (for obvious reasons) to acquire the Magical Memory
when one has been sworn for many lives to reincarnate immediately. The
great obstacle is the phenomenon called Freudian forgetfulness; that is
to say, that, though an unpleasant event may be recorded faithfully
enough by the mechanism of the brain, we fail to recall it, or recall it
wrong, because it is painful. “The Psychopathology of Everyday Life”
analyses and illustrâtes this phenomenon in detail. Now, the King of
Terrors being Death, it is hard indeed to look it in the face. Mankind
has created a host of phantastic masks; people talk of “going to
heaven”, “passing over”, and so on; banners flaunted from paste- board
towers of baseless théories. One instinctively flinches from remembering
one’s last, as one does from imagining one’s next, death. 1 The point of
view of the initiate helps one immensely.</p>
<p>As soon as one has passed this Pons Asinorum, the practice becomes
much easier. It is much less trouble to reach the life before the last;
familiarity with death breeds contempt for it.</p>
<p>It is a very great assistance to the beginner if he happens to hâve
some intellectual grounds for identifying himself with some definite
person in the immédiate past. A brief account of Aleister Crowley’s good
fortune in this matter should be instructive. It will be seen that the
points of contact vary greatly in character.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>The date of Eliphas Levi’s death was about six months previous to
that of Aleister Crowley s birth. The reincarnating ego is supposed to
take possession of the foetus at about this stage of
development.</p></li>
<li><p>This latter is a very valuable practice to perforai. See Liber
HHH; also read up the Buddhist méditations on the Ten
Impurities.</p></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Eliphas Levi had a striking personal resemblarice td Aleister
Growley’s father. This of course merely suggests a certain degree of
suitability from a physical point of view.</p></li>
<li><p>Aleister Crowley wrote a play called “The Fatal Force” at a time
when he had not read any of Eliphas Levi’s Works. The motive of this
play is a Magical Operation of a very peculiar kincl The formula which
Aleister Crowley supposed to be his original idea is mentioned by Levi.
We hâve not been able to trace it anywhere else with such exact
correspondent in every dtail.</p></li>
<li><p>Aleister Crowley found a certain quarter of Paris incom-
prehensibly familiar and attractive to him. This was not the ordinary
phenomenon of the déjà vu, it was chiefly a sense of being at home
again. He discovered long after that Levi had lived in the neighbourhood
for many years.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many curious similarities between the events of Eliphas
Levi’s life and that of Aleister Crowley. The intention 6f the parents
that their son should hâve a religious career; the inability to make use
of very remarkable talents in any regular wây; the inexplicable
ostracism which afflicted him, and whose authors seemed somehow to be
ashamed of themselves; the events relative to marriage 1 : ail these
offer surprisingly close parallels.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>6 . The characters of the two men présent subtle identities in many
points. Both seem to be constantly trying to reconcile insuperable
antagonisms. Both find it hard to destroy the delusion that men’s fixed
beliefs and customs may be radically altered by a féw friendly
explanations. Both show a curious fondness for oüt-the-way learning,
preferring recondite sources of knowledge they adopt eccentric
appearances. Both inspire what can only be called panic fear in absolute
strangers, who can give no reason wFatever for a repulsion which
sometimes almost amounts to</p>
<p>I. Levi, on her deliberately abandoning him, withdrew his protection
from his wife; she lost her beauty and intelligence, and became the prey
of an aged and hideous pithecoid. Aleister Crowley’s wife insisted upon
doing her own will, as she defined it; this compelled him to stand
aside. What happened to Mme. Constant happened to her, although in a
more violent and disastrous form.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>temporary insanity. The ruling passion in each case is that of
helping humanity. Both show quixotic disregard of their personal
prosperity, and even comfort, yet both display love of luxury and
splendour. Both hâve the pride of Satan.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>When Aleister Crowley became Frater OT MH and had to write his
thesis for the grade of Adeptus Exemptus, he had already collected his
ideas when Levi s “Clef des Grands Mystères” fell ipto his hands. It was
remarkable that he, having admired Levi for many years, and even begun
to suspect the identity, had not troubled (although an extravagant buyer
of books) to get this particular work. He found, to his astonishment,
tha^t almost everything that he had himself intended to say was there
written. The resuit of this was that he abandoned writing his original
work, and instead translated the masterpiece in question.</p></li>
<li><p>The style of the two men is strikingly similar in numerous subtle
and deep-seated ways. The general point of view is almost identical. The
quality of the irony is the same. Both take a perverse pleasure in
playing practical jokes on the reader. In one point, above ail, the
identity is absolute — there is no third name in literature which can be
put in the same class. The point is this: In a single sentence is
combined sublimity and enthusiasm with sneering bitterness, scepticism,
grossness and scorn. It is evidently the suprême enjoyment to strike a
chord composed of as many conflicting éléments as possible. The pleasure
seems to be derived from gratifying the sense of power, the power to
compel every possible element of thought to contribute to the
spasm.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the theory of reincarnation were generally accepted, the above
considérations would make out a strong case. Frater Perdurabo was quite
convinced in one part of his mind of this identity, long before he got
any actual memories as such. 1</p>

<p>Unless one has a groundwork of this sort to start with, one must get
back to one’s life as best one can by the methods above indicated.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Long since writing the above, the publication of the biography of
Eliphas Levi by M. Paul Chacornat has confirmed the hypothesis in
innumerable striking ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>53</p>
<p>It may be of sortie assistance to give a few characteristics of
geunine Magical Memory; to mention a few sources of error, and to lay
down critical mies for the vérification of one’s results.</p>
<p>The first great danger arises from vanity. One should always beware
of “remembering” that one was Cleopatra or Shakespeare.</p>
<p>x4gain, superficial resemblances are usually misleading.</p>
<p>One of the great tests of the genuineness of any recollection is that
one remembers the really important things in one’s life, not those which
mankind commonly classes as such. For instance, iUeister Crowley does
not remember any of the décisive events in the life of Eliphas Levi. He
recalls intimate trivialities of childhood. He has a vivid recollection
of certain spiritual crises; in particular, one which was fought out as
he paced up and down a lonely stretch of road in a fiat and desolate
district. He remembers ridiculous incidents, such as often happen at
suppers when the conversation takes a turn such that its gaiety somehow
strikes to the soûl, and one receives a suprême révélation which is yet
perfectly inarticulate. He has forgotten his marriage and its tragic
results *, although the plagiarism which Fate has been shame- less
enough to perpetrate in his présent life, would naturally, one might
think, reopen the wound.</p>
<p>There is a sense which assures us intuitively when we are running on
a scent breast high. There is an oddness about’ the memory which is
somehow annoying. It gives a feeling of shame and guiltiness. There is a
tendency to blush. One feels like a schoolboy caught red-handed in the
act of writing poetry. There is the same sort of feeling as one has when
one finds a faded photo- graph or a lock of hair twenty years old among
the rubbish in some forgotten cabinet. This feeling is independent of
the ques¬ tion whether the thing remember was in itself a source of
pleasure or of pain. Can it be that we resent the idea of our “previoüs
condition of servitude”? We want to forget the past, however good reason
we may hâve to be proud of it. It is well known that many men are
embarrassed in the presence of a monkey.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>It is perhaps signifïcant that although the name of the woman has
been familiar to him since 1898, he has never been able to commit it to
memory.</li>
</ol>
<p>54</p>
<p>When this “loss of face” does not occur, distrust the accuracy of the
item which you recall. The only reliable recollections* which présent
themselves with serenity are invariably connected with what men call
disasters. Instead of the feeling of being caught in the slips, one has
that of being missed at the wicket. One has the sly satisfaction of
having done an outrageously foolish thing and got off scot free. When
one sees life in perspective, it is an immense relief to discover that
things like bankruptcy, wedlock, and the gallows made no particular
différence. They were only accidents such as might happen to anybody;
they had no real bearing on the point at issue. One consequently
remembers having one’s ears cropped as a lucky escape, while the casual
jest of a drunken skeinsmate in an all-night café stings one with the
shame of the parvenu to whom a poli te stranger has unsuspectingly
mentioned “Mine Uncle”.</p>
<p>The testimony of intuitions is, however, strictly subjective, and
shrieks for collateral security. It would be a great error to ask too
much. In conséquence of the peculiar character of the recol¬ lections
which are under the microscope, anything in the shape of gross
confirmation almost présumés per jury. A pathologist would arouse
suspicion if he said that his bacilli had arranged themselves on the
slide so as to spell Staphylococcus. We distrust an arrange¬ ment of
flowers which tells us that “Life is worth living in Detroit, Michigan”.
Suppose that Aleister Crowley remembers that he was Sir Edward Kelly. It
does not follow that he will be able to give us details of Cracow in the
time of James I of» England. Material events are the words of an
arbitrary languagej the symbols of a cipher previously agreed on. What
happened to Kelly in Cracow may hâve meant something to him, but there
is no reason to présumé that it has any meaning for his successor.</p>
<p>There is an obvious line of criticism about any recollection. It must
not clash with ascertained facts. F or example one cannot hâve two lives
which overlap, unless there is reason to suppose that the earlier died
spiritually before his body ceased to breathe. This might happen in
certain cases, such as insanity.</p>
<p>It is not conclusive against a previous incarnation that the présent
should be inferior to the past. One’s life may represent the full
possibilities of a certain partial Karma. One may hâve</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>devoted one’s incarnation to discharging the liabilities of one part
of one’s previous character. For instance, one might devote a lifetime
to settling the bill run up b y Napoléon for causing un- necessary
suffering, with the object of starting afresh, clear of debt, in a life
devoted to reaping the reward of the Corsican’s invaluable services to
the race.</p>
<p>The Master Therion, in fact, rernembers several incarnations of
almost uncompensated wretchedness, anguish and humiliation, voluntarily
undertaken so that he might résumé his work un- hampered by spiritual
creditors.</p>
<p>These are the stigmata. Memory is hall-marked by its corre- spondence
with the facts actually observed in the présent. This correspondence may
be of two kinds. It is rare (and it is unimpor- tant for the reasons
stated above) that one s memory should be confirmed by what may be
called, contemptuously, external evidence. It was indeed a reliable
contribution to psychology to remark that an evil and adulterous
génération sought for a sign.</p>
<p>(Even so, the permanent value of the observation is to trace the
genealogy of the Pharisee — from Caiaphas to the modem Christian.)</p>
<p>Signs mislead, from “Painless Dentistry” upwards. The fact that
anything is intelligible proves that it is addressed to the wrong
quarter, because the very existence of language présupposés impotence to
communicate directly. When Walter Raleigh flung his cloak upon the muddy
road, he merely expressed, in a cipher contrived by a combination of
circumstances, his otherwise inex- pressible wish to get on good terms
with Queen Elizabeth. The significance of his action was determined by
the concourse of circumstances. The reality can hâve no reason for
reproducing itself exclusively in that especial form. It can hâve no
reason for remembering that so extravagant a ritual happened to be
necessary to worship. Therefore, however well a man might remember his
incarnation as Julius Caesar, there is no necessity for his representing
his power to set ail upon the hazard of a die by imagining the Rubicon.
Any spiritual State can be symbolized by an infinité variety of actions
in an infinité variety of circum¬ stances. One should recollect only
those events which happen to</p>
<p>56 —</p>
<p>be immediately linked with one’s peculiar tendencies to imagine one
thing rather than another. 1</p>
<p>Genuine recollections almost invariably explain oneself to oneself.
Suppose, for example, that you feel an instinctive aversion to some
particular kind of wine. Try as you will, you can find no reason for
your idiosyncrasy. Suppose, then, that when you explore some previous
incarnation, you remember that you died by a poison administered in a
wine of that character, your aversion is explained by the proverb, a A
burnt. child dreads the fire.” It may be objected that in such a case
your libido has created a phantasm of itself in the manner which Freud
has explained. The criticism is just, but its value is reduced if it
should happen that you were not aware of its existence until your
Magical Memory attracted your attention to it. In fact, the essence of
the test consists in this: that your memory notifies you of something
which is the logical conclusion of the prémisses postulated by the
past.</p>
<p>As an example, we may cite certain memories of the Master Therion. He
followed a train of thought which led him to remember his life as a
Roman named Marius de Aquila. It would be straining probability to
présumé a connection between (a) this hieroglyphically recorded mode of
self-analysis and (J 3 ) ordinary introspection conducted on principles
intelligible to himself. He remembers directly various people and
various events connected with this incarnation ; and they are in
themselves to ail appearance actual. There is no particular reason why
they, rather than any others, should hâve entered his sphere. In the act
of remembering them, they are absolute. He can find no reason for
correlating them with anything in the présent. But a subséquent examina¬
tion of the record shows that the logical resuit of the Work of Marius
de Aquila did not occur to that romantic reprobate; in point of fact, he
died before anything could happen. Can we suppose that any cause can be
baulked of effect? The Universe is unanimous in rebuttal. If then the
exact effects which might be expected to resuit from these causes are
manifested in the career</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The exception is when some whimsical circumstance ties a knot in the
corner of one’s mnemonic handkerchief.</li>
</ol>
<p>57</p>
<p>of the Master Therion, it is assuredly the easiest and most reasona-
ble explanation to assume an identity between the two men. Nobodv is
shocked to observe that the ambition of Napoléon has diminished the
average stature of Frenchmen. We Know that somehow or other every force
must find its fulfilment; and those people who hâve grasped the fact
that external events are merely symptoms of external ideas, cannot find
any difficulty in attributing the correspondences of the one to the
identities of the other.</p>
<p>Far be it from any apologist for Magick to insist upon the objective
validity of these concaténations! It would be childish to cling to the
belief that Marius de Aquila actually existed; it matters no more than
it matters to the mathematician whether the use of the symbol X 22
involves the ‘reality* of 22 dimensions of space. The Master Therion
does not care a scrap of yesterday’s newspaper whether he was Marius de
Aquila, or whether there ever was such a person, or whether the Universe
itself is anything more than a nightmare created by his own imprudence
in the matter of rum and water. His memory of Marius de Aquila, of the
adventures of that person in Rome and the Black Forest, matters nothing,
either to him or to anybody else. What matters is this: True or false,
he has found a symbolic form which has enabled him to govern himself to
the best advantage. “Quantum nobis prodest haec fabula Christi!” The
‘falsity’ of Aesop’s bables does not diminish their value to
mankind.</p>
<p>The above réduction of the Magical Memory to a device for
externalizing one’s interior wisdom need not be regarded as sceptical,
save only in the last resort. No scientific hypothesis can adduce
stronger evidence of its validity than the confirmation of its
prédictions by experimental evidence. The objective can always be
expressed in subjective symbols if necessary. The cori- troversy is
ultimately unmeaning. However we interpret the evidence, its relative
truth dépends in its internai cohérence. We may therefore say that any
magical recollection is genuine if it gives the explanation of our
external or internai conditions. Anything which throws light upon the
Universe, anything which reveals us to ourselves, should be welcome in
this world of riddles.</p>
<p>As our record extends into the past, the evidence of its truth is
cumulative. Every incarnation that we remember must increase</p>
<p>our compréhension of ourselves as we are. Each accession of knowledge
must indicate with unmistakable accuracy the solution of some enigma
which is propounded by the Sphynx of our own unknown birth-city, Thebes.
The complicated situation in which we find ourselves is composed of
éléments  and no element of it came out of nothing. Newton’s First Law
applies to every plane of thought. The theory of évolution is omniform.
There is a reason for one’s prédisposition to goût, or the shape of
one’s ear, in the past. The symbolism may change ; the facts do not. In
one form or another, everything that exists is derived from some
previous manifestation. Hâve it, if you will, fhat the memories of other
incarnations are dreamsj but dreams are determined by reality just as
much as the events of the day. The truth is to be apprehended by the
correct translation of the symbolic language. The last section of the
Oath of the Master of the Temple is: “I swear to interpret every
phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my soûl.” The Magical
Memory is (in the last analysis) one manner, and, as expérience
testifies, one of the most important manners, of performing this
vow.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>Of Equilibrium, and of the General and Particular Method of
Préparation of the Furniture of the Temple and of the Instruments of
Art.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>“Before there was equilibrium, countenance beheld not count¬ enance.”
1 So sayeth the holiest of the Books of the ancient Qabalah. (Siphra
Tzeniutha I. 2.) One countenance here spoken of is the Macrocosm, the
other the Microcosm. 2</p>
<p>As said above, the object of any magick ceremony is to unité the
Macrocosm and the Microcosm.</p>
<p>It is as in optics; the angles of incidence and reflection are
equal.</p>
<p>You must get your Macrocosm and Microcosm exactly balanced,
vertically and horizontally, or the images will not coincide.</p>
<p>This equilibrium is affirmed by the magician in arranging the Temple.
Nothing must be lop-sided. If you hâve anything in the North, you must
put something equal and opposite to it in the</p>
<p>South. The importance of this is so great, and the truth of it so
obvious, that no one with the most médiocre capacity</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The full significance of this aphorism is an Arcanum of the grade
of Ipsissimus. It may, however, be partially apprehended by study of
Liber Aleph, and the Book of the Law and the Commentaries thereon. It
explains Existence.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the case because we happen ourselves to be Microcosms
whose Law is “love under will”. But it is aîso Magick for an unit which
has attained Perfection (in absolute nothingness, 0 °), to become
“divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>6 o</p>
<p>for magick can lolerate any unbalanced object for a moment. His
instinct instantly revolts. 1 For this reason the weapons, altar,
circle, and magus are ail carefully proportioned one with another. It
will not do to hâve a cup like a thimble and a wand like a weaver’s
beam. 1 2 3</p>
<p>Again, the arrangement of the weapons on the altar must be such that
they look balanced. Nor should the magician hâve any unbalanced
ornament. If he hâve the wand in his right hand, let him hâve the Ring ”
on his left, or let him take the Ankh, or the Bell, or the Cup. And
however little he move to the right, let him balance it by an équivalent
movement to the left; or if forwards, backwards; and let him correct
each idea by implying the contradictory contained therein. If he invoke
Severity, let him recount that Severity is the instrument of Mercy; 4 if
Stability, let him show the basis of that Stability to be constant
change, just as the stability of a molécule is secured by the momentum
of the swift atoms contained in it. 5</p>
<p>In this way let every idea go forth as a triangle on the base of two
opposites, making an apex transcending their contradiction in a higher
harmony.</p>
<p>It is not safe to use any thought in Magick, unless that thought bas
been thus equilibrated and destroyed.</p>
<p>Thus again with the instruments themselves; the Wand must be ready to
change into a Serpent, the Pantacle into the whirling Svastika or Disk
of Jove, as if to fulfil the functions of the Sword.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This is becausc the essence of his being a Magician is his
intuitive appréhension of the fundamental principles of the Universe.
His instinct is a subconscious assertion of the structural identity of
the Macrocosm and the Microcosm. Equilibrium is the condition of
manifested existence.</p></li>
<li><p>See Bagh-i-Muattar, V, par. 2.</p></li>
<li><p>The Ring has not been described in Part II of this book, for
reasons which may be or may not be apparent to the reader. It is the
Symbol of Nuit, the totality of the possible ways in which he may repo¬
sent himself and fulfil himself.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, as when Firmness with one’s self or another is the
truest kindness; or when amputation saves life.</p></li>
<li><p>See Liber 418, nth Aethyr.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>61</p>
<p>The Cross is both the death of the “Saviour” 1 and the Phallic symbol
of Résurrection. Will itself must be ready to culminate in the surrender
of that Will: 2 the aspirations arrow that is shot against the Holy Dove
must transmute itself into the wondering Virgin that receives in her
womb the quickening of that same Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Any idea that is thus in itself positive and négative, active and
passive, male and female, is fit to exist above the Abyss; any idea not
so equilibrated is below the Abyss, contains in itself an unmitigated
duality or falsehood, and is to that extent qliphotic 3 and dangerous.
Even an idea like “truth” is unsafe unless it is realized that ail Truth
is in one sense falsehood. For ail Truth is relative ; and if it be
supposed absolute, will mislead. 4 “The Book of Lies falsely so called”
(Liber 333) is worthy of close and careful study in this respect. The
reader should also consult Konx Om Pax, “Introduction”, and “Thien Tao”
in the same volume.</p>
<p>Ail this is to be expressed in the words of the ritual itself, and
symbolised in every act performed.</p>

<p>It is said in the ancient books of Magick that everything used by the
Magician must be “virgin”. That is: it must never hâve been used by any
other person or for any other purpose. The</p>

<li><p>See The Qabalah for the use of this Word, and study the doctrine
concerning the Kings of Edom.</p></li>
<li><p>See Poincaré for the mathematical proof of this thesis. But
Spiritual Expérience goes yet deeper, and destroys the Canon of the Law
of Contradiction. There is an immense amount of work by the Master
Therion on this subject; it pertains especially to His grade of 9 0 =
2°. Such profundities are unsuited to the Student, and may unsettle him
seriously. It will be best for him to consider (provisionally) Truth in
the sense in which it is taken by Physical Sicence.</p></li>

<p>62</p>
<p>greatest importance was attached by the Adepts of old to this, and it
made the task of the Magician no easy one. He wanted a wand; and in
order to eut and trim it he needed a knife. It was not sufficient merely
to buy a new knife; he felt that he had to make it himself. In order to
make the knife, he would require a hundred other things, the acquisition
of each of which might require a hundred more; and so on. This shows the
impossibility of disentangling one’s self from one’s environment. Even
in Magick we cannot get on without the Help of others. 1</p>
<p>There was, however, a further object in this recommendation. Ihe more
trouble and difficulty your weapon costs, the more useful you will find
it. “If you want a thing well done, do it yourself.” It would be quite
useless to take this book to a départ¬ aient store, and instruct them to
furnish you a Temple according to spécification. It is really worth the
while of the Student who requires a sword to go and dig out iron ore
from the earth, to* smelt it himself with charcoal that he has himself
prepared, to forge the weapon with his own hand: and even to take the
trouble of synthesizing the oil of vitriol with which it is engraved. He
will hâve learnt a lot of useful things in his attempt to make a really
virgin sword; he will understand how one thing dépends upon another; he
will begin to appreciate the meaning of the words “the harmony of the
Universe”, so often used so stupidly and superficially by the ordinary
apologist for Nature, and he will also perceive the true operation of
the law of Karma. 2</p>
<p>Another notable injunction of the ancient Magick was that whatever
appertained to the Work should be single. The Wand was to be eut with a
single stroke of the knife. There must be no</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is, and the fact is still more important, utterly fatal and
demora- lizing to acquire the habit of reliance on others. The Magician
must know every detail of his work, and be able and willing to roll up
his shirt- sleeves and do it, no matter how trivial or menial it may
seem. Abra- melin (it is true) forbids the Aspirant to perform any tasks
of an humilia- ting type; but he will never be able to command perfect
service unless he has expérience of such necessary work, mastered during
his early training.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . In this sense especially: any one thing in volves, and is
involved in, others apparently altogether alien.</p>
<p>63 —</p>
<p>boggling and hacking at things, no clumsiness and no hésitation. If
you strike a blow at ail, strike with your strength! “Whatsoever thy
hand findeth to do, do it with ail thy might!” If you are going to take
up Magick, rnake no compromise. You cannot make révolutions with
rose-water, or wrestle in a silk hat. You will find very soon that you
must either iose the hat or stop wrestling. Most people do both. They
take up the magical path with ou t sufficient reflection, without that
détermination of adamant which made the author of this book exclaim, as
he took the first oath, “PERDURABO” — “I will endure unto the end!” 3
They start on it at a great pace, and then find that their boots are
covered with mud. Instead of persisting, they go back to Piccadilly.
Such persons hâve only themselves to thank if the very street-boys mock
at them.</p>
<p>Another recommendation was this: buy whatever may be necessary
without haggling!</p>
<p>You must not try to strike a proportion between the values of
incommensurable things. * 2 The least of the Magical Instruments is
worth infinitely more than ail that</p>
<p>you possess, or, if you like, than ail that you stupidly suppose
yourself to possess. Break this rule, and the usual Nemesis of the
half-hearted awaits you. Not only do you get inferior instruments, but
you lose in some other way what you thought you were so clever to hâve
saved. Remember Ananias!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you purchase without haggling you will find
that along with your purchase the vendor has thrown in</p>
<p>ï. “For, enduring unto the End, at the End was Naught to endure.”

<li>Observe well that there is never any real équivalence or measurable
relation between any two things, for each is impregnably Itself. The
exchange of property is not a mathematically accurate équation. The Wand
is merely a conventional expression of the Will, just as a word is of a
thought. It can never be anything else; thus, though the process of
making it, whether it involves time, money, or labour, is a spiritual
and moral synthesis, it is not measurable in terms of its éléments.</li>

<p>the purse of Fortunatus. No matter in what extremity you may seem to
be, at the last moment your difficulties will be solved. For there is no
power either of the firmament or of the etlier, or of the eartli or
under the earth, on dry land or in the water, of whirling air or of
rushing fire, or any spell or scourge of God which is not obedient to
the necessity of the Magician! That which he has, he has not; but that
which he is, he is; and that which he will be, he will be. And neither
God nor Man, nor ail the malice of Choronzon, can either check him, or
cause him to waver for one instant upon the Path. This command and this
promise hâve been given by ail the Magi without exception. And where
this command has been obeyed, this promise has been most certainly
fulfilled.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>In ail actions the same formulae are applicable. To invoke a god,
i.e. to raise yourself to that godhead, the process is threefold,
PURIFICATION, CONSECRATION and INI¬ TIATION.</p>
<p>Therefore every magical weapon, and even the furniture of the Temple,
must be passed through this threefold regimen. The details only vary on
inessential points. E.g. to préparé the magician, he purifies himself by
maintaining his chastity 1 and abstaining from any défilement. But to do
the same with, let us say, the Cup, we assure ourselves that the métal
has never been employed for any other purpose — we smelt virgin ore, and
we take ail possible pains in refining the métal — it must be chemically
pure.</p>
<p>To sum up this whole matter in a phrase, every article employed is
treated as if it were a candidate for initiation; but in those parts of
the ritual in which the candidate is blindfolded, we wrap the weapon in
a black cloth 2 . The oath which he takes is replaced by a “charge” in
similar terms. The details of the préparation of each weapon should be
thought out carefully by the magician.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See The Book of the Law and the Commentaries thereon for the true
définition of this virtue.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . This refers to the “formula of the Néophyte”. There are alter¬
natives.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Further, the attitude of the magician to his weapous should be tliat
of the God to the suppliant who invokes Him. It should he the love of
the father for his child, the tenderness and care of the hridegroom for
his bride, and that peculiar feeling which the creator of every work of
art feeïs for his masterpieee.</p>
<p>Where this is clearly understood, the magician will find no
difficulty in observing the proper ritual, not only in the actual
cérémonial consécration of each weapon, but in the actuai prépara¬ tion,
a process which should adumbrate this ceremony; e.g., the magician will
eut the wand from the tree, will strip it of leaves and twigs, will
remove the bark. He will trim the ends neatly, and smooth down the
knots: —this is the banishing.</p>
<p>He will then rub it with the consecrated oil until it becomes smooth
and glistening and golden. - He will then wrap it in silk of the
appropriate colour: —this is the Consécration.</p>
<p>He will then take it, and imagine that it is that hollow tube in
which Prometheus brought down fire from Heaven, formulating to himself
the passing of the Holy Influence through it. In this and other ways he
will perform the initiation; and, this being accomplished, he will
repeat the whole process in an elaborate ceremony. 1</p>
<p>To take an entirely different case, that of the Circle; the magician
will synthesize the Vermilion required from Mercury and Sulphur which he
has himself sublimated. This pure</p>
<p>I. I hâve omitted to say that the whole subject of Magick is an
example of Mythopoeia in that particular form called Disease of Lan-
miage. Thoth, God of Magick, was merely a man who invented writing, as
his monuments déclaré clearly enough. “Gramarye”, Magick, is.only the
Greek “Gramma”. So also the old name of a Magical Ritual, “Grimoire”, is
merely a Grammar.</p>
<p>It appeared marvellous to the vulgar that men should be able to
communicate at a distance, and they began to attribute other powers,
merely invented, to the people who were able to Write. The Wand is then
nothing but the pen; the Cup, the Inkpot; the Dagger, the knife for
sharpening the pen; and the disk (Pantacle) is either the papyrus roll
itself; or the weight which kept it in position, or the sandbox for
soaking up the ink. And, of course, the “Papyrus of Ani is only the
Latin for toilet-paper.</p>
<p>— 66 —</p>
<p>vermilion he will himself mix with the consecrated oïl, and as he
uses this paint he will think intently and with dévotion of the symbols
which he draws. This circle may then be initiated by a circumambulation,
during which the magician invokes the names of God that are on it.</p>
<p>Any person without sufficient ingenuity to devise proper methods of
préparation for the other articles required is unlikely to make much of
a magician; and we shall only waste space if we deal in detail with the
préparation of each instrument.</p>
<p>There is a definite instruction in Liber A vel Armorum, in the
Equinox, Volume I, Number IV, as to the Lamp and the Four Elemental
Weapons.</p>
<p>— 6?</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>Of Silence and Secrecy :</p>
<p>AND OF</p>
<p>The Barbarous names of Evocation</p>
<p>It is found by expérience (confirming the statement of Zoro- aster)
that the most potent conjurations are those in an ancient and perhaps
forgotten language, or even those couched in a corrupt and possibly
always meaningless jargon. Of these there are several main types. The
“preliminary invocation” in the “Goetia” consists principally of
corruptions of Greek and Egyptian names. For example, we find
“Osorronnophris” for “Asor Un-Nefer”. 1 The conjurations given by
Dr. Dee (vide Equinox I, VIII) are an a language called Angelic, or
Enochian. Its source has hnherto baffled research, but it is a language
and not a jargon, for it possesses a structure of its own, and there are
traces or grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>However this may be, it works. Even the beginner finds that “things
happen” when he uses it: and this is an advantage or disadvantage !
—shared by no other type of language. The rest</p>
<p>need skill. This needs Prudence!</p>
<p>The Egyptian Invocations are much purer, but their meaning has not
been sufficiently studied by persons magically competent. We possess a
number of Invocations in Greek of every degree of excellence ; in Latin
but few, and those of inferioi quality. It will be noticed that in every
case the conjurations are very sonorous,</p>
<p>I.. See appendix 4, Liber Samekh; this is an édition of this Invoca¬
tion, with an elaborate Rubric, translation, scholia, and
instruction.</p>
<p>68 —</p>
<p>and there is a certain magical voice in which they should be recited.
This spécial voice was a natural gift of the Master Therion; but it can
be easily taught — to the right people.</p>
<p>Various considérations impelled Him to attempt conjurations in the
English language. There already existed one example, the charm of the
witches in Macbeth ; although this was perhaps not meant seriously, its
effect is indubitable. * 1</p>
<p>He has found iambic tetrameters enriched with many rimec both
internai and external very useful. “The Wizard Way” (Equinox 1 , 1 )
gives a good idea of the sort of thing. So does the Evocation of
Bartzabel in Equinox I, IX. There are many extant invocations throughout
his works, in many kinds of métré, of many kinds of being, and for many
kinds of purposes. (See Appendix).</p>
<p>Other methods of incantation are on record as efficacious. For
instance Frater I. A., when a child, was told that he could invoke the
devil by repeating the “Lord’s Prayer” backwards. He went into the
garden and did so. The Devil appeared., and almost scared him out of his
life.</p>
<p>It is therefore not quite certain in what the efficacy of conjura¬
tions really lies. The peculiar mental excitement required may even be
aroused by the perception of the absurdity of the process, and the
persistence in it, as when once Frater Perdurabo (at the end of His
magical resources) recited “From Greenland’s Icy Mountains”, and
obtained His resuit. 1</p>
<p>It may be conceded in any case that the long strings of formidable
words which roar and moan through so many conjurations hâve a real
effect in exalting the consciousness of the magician to the proper pitch
— that they should do so is no more extraordinary than music of any kind
should do so.</p>
<p>Magicians hâve not confined themselves to the use of the human voice.
The Pan-pipe with its seven stops, corresponding to the seven planets,
the bull-roarer, the tom-tom, and even the violin, hâve ail been used,
as well as many others, of which the</p>
<p>I. A true poet cannot help revealing himself and the truth of things
in his art, whether he be aware of what he is writing, or no.</p>
<p>I. See “Eleusis”, A. Crowley, Collected Works, Vol. III Epilogue.</p>
<p>— 69</p>
<p>most important is the bell  though this is used not so much for
actual conjuration as to mark stages in the ceremony. Of ail these the
tom-tom will be found to be the most generally useful.</p>
<p>While on the subject of barbarous names of évocation we should not
omit the utterance of certain suprême words which enshrine (a) the
complété formula of the God invoked, or (3 the whole ceremony.</p>
<p>Examples of the former kind are Tetragrammaton, I.A.O., and
Abrahadabra.</p>
<p>An example of the latter kind is the great Word StiBeTTChe-
PhMeFSHiSS, which is a line drawn on the Tree of Life (Coptic
attributions) in a certain manner. 1 2</p>
<p>With ail such words it is of the utmost importance that they should
never be spoken until the suprême moment, and even then they should
burst from the magician almost despite himself — so great should be his
réluctance 3 to utter them. In fact, they should be the utterance of the
God in him at the first onset of the divine possession. So uttered, they
cannot fail of effect, for they hâve become the effect.</p>
<p>Every wise magician will hâve constructed (according to the
principles of the Holy Qabalah) many such words, and he should hâve
quintessentialised them ail in one Word, which last Word, once he has
formed it, he should never utter consciously even in thought, until
perhaps with it he gives up the ghost. Such a Word should in fact be so
potent that man cannot hear it and live.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See Part II. It should be said that in expérience no bell save
His own Tibetan bell of Electrum Magicum has ever sounded satisfactory
to the Master Therion. Most bells jar and repel.</p></li>
<li><p>It represents the descent of a certain Influnce. See the
Evocation of Taphtatharath, Equinox I, III. The attributions are given
in 777. This Word expresses the current Kether - Beth - Binah - Cheth -
Geburch - Mem - Hod - Shin - Malkuth, the descent from 1 to 10 via the
Pillar of Severity.</p></li>
<li><p>This réluctance is Freudian, due to the power of these words to
awaken the suppressed subconscious libido.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 70 —</p>
<p>Such a word was indeed the lost Tetragrammaton  It is said that at
the utterance of this name the Universe crashes into dis¬ solution. Let
the Magician eamestly seek this Lost Word, for its pronunciation is
synonymous with the accomplish- ment of the Great Work. 1 2</p>
<p>In this matter of the efficacity of words there are again two formulæ
exactly opposite in nature. A word may become potent and terrible by
virtue of constant répétition. It is in this way that most religions
gain strength. At first the statement “So and so is God” excites no
interest. Continue, and you meet scora and scepticism: possibly
persécution. Continue, and the controversy has so far died out that no
one troubles to contradict your assertion.</p>
<p>No superstition is so dangerous and so lively as an exploded
superstition. The newspapers of to-day (written and edited almost
exclusively by men without a spark of either religion or morality) dare
not hint that any one disbelieves in the ostensibly prevailing cuit j
they déploré Atheism — ail but universal in practice and implicit in the
theory of practically ail intelligent people — as if it were the
eccentricity of a few negligible or objectionable persons. This is the
ordinary story of advertisement ; the sham has exactly the same chance
as the real. Persistence is the only quality required for success.</p>
<p>The opposite formula is that of secrecy. An idea is perpetuated
because it must never be mentioned. A Freemason never forgets the secret
words entrusted to him, though these words mean, absolutely nothing to
him, in the vast majority of cases; the only reason for this is that he
has been forbidden to mention them, although they hâve been published
again and again, and are as accessible to the profane as to the
initiate.</p>
<p>In such a work of practical Magick as the preaching of a new</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Master Therion has received this Word; it is communicated by Him
to the proper postulants, at the proper time and place, in the proper
circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . Each man has a different Great Work, just as no two points on the
circumference of a circle are connected with the centre by the same
radius. The Word will be correspondingly unique.</p>
<p>7 1 —</p>
<p>Law, these methods may be advantageously combined ; en the one hand
infinité frankness and readiness to communicate ail secrets ; on the
other the sublime and terrible knowledge that ail real secrets are
incommunicable. 1</p>
<p>It is, according to tradition, a certain advantage in conjurations to
employ more than one language. In ail probability the reason of this is
that any change spurs the flagging attention. A man engaged in intense
mental labour will frequently stop and walk up and down the room — one
may suppose for this cause — but it is a sign of weakness that this
should be necessary. For the; beginner in Magick, however, it is
permissible 2 to employ any device to secure the resuit.</p>
<p>Conjurations should be recited, not readj 3 4 and the entire ceremony
should be so perfectly performed that one is hardly conscious of any
effort of memory. The ceremony should be constructed with such logical
fatality that a mistake is im¬ possible/ The conscious ego of the
Magician is to be destroyed to be absorbed in that of the God whom he
invokes, and the process should not interfère with the automaton who is
performing the ceremony.</p>
<p>But this ego of which it is here spoken is the true ultimate ego. The
automaton should possess will, energy, intelligence, reason, and
resource. This automaton should be the perfect man far more</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If this were not the case, individuality wouid not be inviolable.
No man can communicate even the simplest thought to any other man in any
full and accurate sense. For that thought is sown in a different soil,
and cannot produce an identical effect. I cannot put a spot of red upon
two pictures without altering each in diverse ways. It might hâve little
effect on a sunset by Turner, but much on a nocturne by Whistler. The
ïdentity of the two spots as spots wouid thus be fallacious.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not to say that it is advisable. O how shameful is human
weakness! But it does encourage one — it is useless to deny it — to be
knocked down by a Démon of whose existence one was not really quite
sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Even this is for the weaker brethren. The really great Magus
speaks and acts impromptu and extempore.</p></li>
<li><p>First-rate poetry is easily memorized because the ideas and the
musical values correspond to man’s mental and sensory
structure.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 72 —</p>
<p>than any other man can be. It is only the divine self within the man,
a self as far above the possession of will or any other qualities
whatsoever as the heavens are high above the earth, that should reabsorb
itself into that illimitable radiance of which it is a spark. 1</p>
<p>The great difficulty for the single Magician is so to perfect himself
that these multifarious duties of the Ritual are adequately performed.
At first he will find that the exaltation destroys memory and paralyses
muscle. This is an essential difficulty of the magical process, and can
only be overcome by practice and expérience. 2</p>
<p>In order to aid concentration, and to increase the supply of Energy,
it has been customary for the Magician to employ assist¬ ants or
colleagues. It is doubtful whether the obvious advantages of this plan
compensate the difficulty of procuring suitable persons 3 , and the
chance of a conflict of will or a misunderstanding in the circle itself.
On one occasion Frater Perdurabo was disobeyed by an assistant ; and had
it not been for His promp¬ titude in using the physical compulsion of
the sword, it is probable that the circle would hâve been broken. As it
was, the affair fortunately terminated in nothing more serious than the
destruc¬ tion of the culprit.</p>
<p>However, there is no doubt that an assemblage of persons who really
are in harmony can much more easily produce an effect than a magician
working by himself. The psychology of a Revival meetings” will be
familiar to almost every one, and though such</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This is said of the partial or lesser Works of Magick. This is an
elementary treatise; one cannot discuss higher Works as for example
those of “The Hermit of Aesopus Island”.</p></li>
<li><p>See “The Book of Lies”; there are several chapters on this
subject. But Right Exaltation should produce spontaneously the proper
mental and physical reactions. As soon as tho development is secured,
there will be automatic reflex “justesse”, exactly as in normal aEairs
mind and body respond with free unconscious rightness to the
Will.</p></li>
<li><p>The organic development of Magick in the world due to the
créative Will of the Master Therion makes it with every year that passes
easier to find scientifically trained co-workers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>73</p>
<p>meetings 1 are the foulest and most degraded rituals of black magic,
the laws of Magick are not thereby suspended. The iaws of Magick are the
iaws of Nature.</p>
<p>A singular and world-famous exampie of this is of sufficiently recent
date to be fresh in the memory of many people now living. At a nigger
camp meeting in the “United” States of America, devotees were worked up
to such a pitch of excitement that the whole assembly deveioped a
furious form of hysteria. The comparatively intelligible Cries of
“Glory” and “Hallelujah” no longer expressed the situation. Somebody
screamed out “Ta- ra-ra-boom-de-ay!”, and this was taken up by the whole
meeting and yelled continuously, until reaction set in. The affair got
into the papers, and some particularly bright disciple of John Stuart
Mill, logician and economist, thought that these words, having set one
set of fools crazy, might do the same to ail the other fools in the
world. He accordingly wrote a song, and produced the desired resuit.
This is the most notorious example in recent times of the power exerted
by a barbarous name of évocation.</p>
<p>A few words may be useful to reconcile the general notion of
Causality with that of Magick. How can we be sure that a person waving a
stick and howling thereby produces thunderstorms ? In no other way than
that familiar to Science ; we note that whenever we put a lighted match
to dry gunpowder, an unintelligibly arbitrary phenomenon, that of sound,
is observedj and so forth.</p>
<p>We need not dwell upon this point ; but it seems worth while to
answer one of the objections to the possibility of Magick, chosing one
which is at first sight of an obviously “fatal” character. It is
convenient to quote Verbatim from the Diary 2 of a distinguished
Magician and philosopher.</p>
<p>“I hâve noticed that the effect of a Magical Work has followed</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See, for an account of properly-conducted congregational cérémo¬
nial, Equinox I, IX. “Energized Enthusiasm”, and Equinox III. I.
Liber</li>

<li>Ecclesiae Gnosticae Catholicae Canon Missae. The “Revival meetings”
here in question were deliberate exploitations of religious
hysteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . In a later entry we read that the diarist has found a similar
train of argument in “Space, Time, and Gravitation ’, page 5 1 * He was
m uch encouraged by the confirmation of his thesis in so independent a
System of thought.</p>
<p>— 74</p>
<p>it so closely that it must hâve been started before the time of the
Work. E. g. I work to night to make X in Paris Write to me. I get the
letter the next morning, so that it must hâve been written before the
Work. Does this deny that the Work caused the effect?</p>
<p>“If I strike a billiard-ball, and it moves, both my will and its
motion are due to causes long antécédent to the act. I may consider both
my Work and its reaction as twin effects of the eternal Universe. The
moved arm and bail are parts of a State of the Cosmos which resulted
necessarily from its momentarily previous State, and so, back for
ever.</p>
<p>“Thus, my Magical Work is only one of the cause-effects necessarily
concomitant with the cause-effects which set the bail in motion. I may
therefore regard the act of striking as a cause- effect of my original
Will to move the bail, though necessarily previous to its motion. But
the case of magical Work is not quite analogous. For my nature is such
that I am compelled to perform Magick in order to make my will to
prevail; so that the cause of my doing the Work is also the cause of the
balPs motion, and there is no reason why one should précédé the other.
(Cf. Lewis Carroll , where the Red Queen screams before she pricks her
finger.)</p>
<p>“Let me illustrate the theory by an actual example.</p>
<p>“I Write from Italy to a a man in France and another in Australia on
the same day, telling them to join me. Both arrive ten days later; the
first in answer to my letter, which he received, the second on “his own
initiative”, as it would seem. But I summoned him because I wanted him;
and I wanted him because he was my représentative ; and his intelligence
made him résolve to join me because it judged rightly that the situation
(so far as he knew it) was such as to make me desire his presence.</p>
<p>“The same cause, therefore, which made me Write to him made him corne
to me; and through it would be improper to say that the writing of the
letter was the direct cause of his arrivai, it is évident that if I had
not written I should hâve been different from what I actually am, and
therefore my relations with him would hâve been otherwise than they are.
In this sense, therefore, the letter and the journey are causally
connected.</p>
<p>“One cannot go farther, and say that in this case I ought to Write
the letter even if he had arrived before I did so; for it</p>
<p>75 —</p>
<p>is part of the whole set of circumstances that I do not use a crowbar
on an open door.</p>
<p>“The conclusion is that one should do one’s Will ‘without lust of
resuit’. If one is working in accordance with the laws of one’s own
nature, one is doing ‘right’; and no such Wo^k can be criticised as
‘useless’, even in cases of the character here discussed. So long as
one’s Will prevails, there is no cause for complaint.</p>
<p>“To abandon one’s Magick would shew lack of self-confidence in one’s
powers, and doubt as to one’s inmost faith in Self and in Nature. 1 Of
course one changes one’s methods as expérience indicates; but there is
no need to change them on any such ground as the above.</p>
<p>“Further, the argument here set forth disposes of the need to explain
the modus operandi of Magick. A successful operation does not involve
any theory soever, not even that of the existence of causality itself.
The whole set of phenomena may be con- ceived as single.</p>
<p>“For instance, if I see a star (as it was years ago) I need not
assume causal relations as existing between it, the earth, and myself.
The connexion existsj I can predicate nothing beyond that. I cannot
postulate purpose, or even détermine the manner in which the event
cornes to be. Similarly, when I do Magick, it is in vain to inquire why
I so act, or why the desired resuit does or does not follow. Nor can I
know how the previous and subséquent conditions are connected. At most I
can describe the consciousness which I interpret as a picture of the
facts, and make empirical generalizations of the superficial aspects of
the case.</p>
<p>“Thus, I hâve my own personal impressions of the act of telephoning;
but I cannot be aware of what consciousness, electri- city, mechanics,
sound, etc., actually are in themselves. And although I can appeal to
expérience to lay down ‘laws’ as to what</p>
<p>I. i. e. on the ground that one cannot understand how Magick can
produce the desired effects. For if one possesses the inclination to do
Magick, it is evidence of a tendency in one’s Nature. Nobody under-
ftands fully how the mind moves the muscles; but we know that lack of
confidence on this point means paralysis. “If the Sun and Moon should
doubt, They’d immediately go out”, as Blake said. Also, as I said
myself. “Who hath the How is careless of the Why”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>conditions accompany the act, I can never be sure that they hâve
always been, or ever will again be, identical. (In fact, it is certain
that an event can never occur twice in precisely the same circum-
stances.) 1</p>
<p>“Further, my ‘laws’ must always take nearly ail the more important
éléments of knowledge for granted. I cannot say — finally — how an
electric current is generated. I cannot be sure that some totally
unsuspected force is not at work in some entirely arbitrary way. For
example, it was formerly supposed that Hydrogen and Chlorine would unité
when an electric spark was passed through the mixture ; now we “know J
that the presence of a minute quantity of aqueous vapour (or some
tertium quid) is essential to the reaction. We formulated before the
days of Ross the ‘laws’ of malarial fever, without reference to the
mosquitoj we might discover one day that the germ is only active when
certain events are transpiring in some nebula 2 , or when so apparently
inert a substance as Argon is présent in the air in certain
proportions.</p>
<p>“We may therefore admit quite cheerfully that Magick is as mysterious
as mathematics, as empirical as poetry, as uncertain as golf, and as
dépendent on the personal équation as Love.</p>
<p>“That is no reason why we should not study, practice and enjoy it •
for it is a Science in exactly the same sense as biology; it is no less
an Art than Sculpture 5 and it is a Sport as much as Moun-
taineering.</p>

<li><p>Magick is less liable to lead to error than any other Science,
because its terms are interchangeable, by définition, so that it is
based on relativity from the start. We run no risk of asserting absolute

the nature of oui senses and our minds necessanly détermines our
observations, so that the limit of our knowledge is subjective, just as
a thermometer can record nothing but its own reaction to one particular
type of Energy.</p>
<p>Magick recognizes frankly (i) that truth is relative, subjective, and
apparent; (2) that Truth implies Omniscience, which is unattainable by
mind, being transfînite; just as if one tried to malce an exact map of
Engiand in England, that map must contain a map of the map, and so on,

law that the method of accomplishing this operation is to realize, and
to acquiesce in, the order of the Universe, and to refrain from
attempting the impossible task of overcoming the inertia of the forces

<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>Of THE GESTURES.</p>
<p>This chapter may be divided into the foliowing parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Attitudes.</p></li>
<li><p>Circumambulations (and similar movements).</p></li>
<li><p>Changes of position (This dépends upon the theory of the
construction of the circle).</p></li>
<li><p>The Knocks or Knells.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I</p>
<p>Attitudes are of two Kinds: natural and artificial. Of the first
kind, prostration is the obvious example. It cornes natural to man (poor
créature!) to throw himself to the ground in the presence of the object
of his adoration. 1</p>
<p>Intermediate between this and the purely artificial form of gestures
cornes a class which dépends on acquired habit. Thus it is natural to an
European officer to offer his sword in token of surrender. A Tibetan
would, however, squat, put out his tongue* and place his hand behind his
right ear.</p>
<p>Purely artificial gestures comprehend in their class the majority of
definitely magick signs, though some of these simulate a natural action
— e.g. the sign of the Rending of the Veil. But the sign of Auramoth
(see Equinox I, II, Illustration “The Signs of the Grades”) merely
imitâtes a hieroglyph which has only a remote connection with any fact
in nature. Ail signs must of course be studied with infinité patience,
and practised until the connection</p>

knee in supplication”, as infamous and ignominious, an abdication of his
sovereignty.</li>
</ol>
<p>79 —</p>
<p>between them and the mental attitude which they represent appears
necessary.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The principal movement in the circle is circumambulation. 1 This has
a very definite resuit, but one which is verv difficult to describe. An
analogy is the dynamo. Circumambulation pro- perly performed in
combination with the Sign of Horus (or “The Enterer”) on passing the
East is one of the best methods of arousing the macrocosmic force in the
Circle. It should never be omitted unless there be some spécial reason
against it.</p>
<p>A particular tread seems appropriate to it. This tread should be
light and stealthy, almost furtive, and yet very purposeful. It is the
pace of the tiger who stalks the deer.</p>
<p>The number of circumambulations should of course correspond to the
nature of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Another important movement is the spiral, of which there are two
principal forms, one inward, one outward. They can be performed in
either direction ; and, like the circumambulation, if performed deosil 2
they invoke — if widdershins 3 they banish 4 . In the spiral the tread
is light and tripping, almost approximating to a dance : while
performing it the magician will usually turn on his own axis, either in
the same direction as</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Part II of this Book 4 it was assumed that the Magician went
barefoot. This would imply his intention to make intimate contact with
his Circle. But he may wear sandals, for the Ankh is a sandal-strap; it
is borne by the Egyptian Gods to signify their power of Going, that is
their eternal energy. By shape the Ankh (or Crux Ansata) suggests the
formula by which this Going is efîected in actual practice.</p></li>

Titan, has in Greek the numerical value of 666.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>80 —</p>
<p>the spiral, or in the opposite direction. Each combination involves a
different symbolism.</p>
<p>There is also the dance proper; it has many different forms, each God
having his spécial dance. One of the easiest and most effective dances
is the ordinary waltz-step combined with the three signs of L.V.X. It is
much easier to attain ecstasy in this way than is generally supposed.
The essence of the process consists in the struggle of the Will against
giddiness; but this struggle must be prolonged and severe, and upon the
degree of this the quality and intensity of ecstasy atained may
dépend.</p>
<p>With practice, giddiness is altogether conquered; exhaustion then
takes its place as the enemy of Will. It is through the mutual
destruction of these antagonisms in the mental and moral being of the
magician that Samadhi is begotten.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Good examples of the use of change of position are given in the
manuscripts Z.i and Z.3; 1 explanatory of the Néophyte Ritual of the G.
D., where the candidate is taken to various stations in the Temple, each
station having a symbolic meaning of its own; but in pure invocation a
better example is given in Liber 831 2 .</p>
<p>In the construction of a ceremony an important thing to décidé is
whether you will or will not make such movements. For every Circle has
its natural symbolism, and even if no use is to be made of these facts,
one must be careful not to let anything be inhar- monious with the
natural attributions. 3 For the sensitive aura of the magician might be
disturbed, and the value of the ceremony completely destroyed, by the
embarassment caused by the discoverv of some such error, just as if a
pre-occupied T-totaller found that he had strayed into a Temple of the
Démon Rum! It is therefore impossible to neglect the theory of the
Circle.</p>

<li><p>Equinox I, VII, pp. 93 sqq.</p></li>
<li><p>The practical necessities of the work are likely to require
certain movements. One should either exclude this symbolism altogether,
or else think out everything beforehand, and make it significant. Do not
let some actions be symbolic and others haphazard.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 8l —</p>
<p>To take a simple example, suppose that, in an Evocation of Bartzabel,
the planet Mars, whose sphere is Geburah (Severity) were situated
(actually, in the heavens) opposite to the Square of Chesed (Mercy) of
the Tau in the Circle, and the triangle placed accordingly. It would be
improper for the Magus to stand on that Square unless using this
formula, “I, frora Chesed, rule Geburah through the Path of the Lion”;
while — taking an extreme case -— to stand on the square of Hod (which
is naturally dominated by Geburah) would be a madness which only a
formula of the very highest Magick could counteract.</p>
<p>Certain positions, however, such as Tiphareth *, are so sympa- thetic
to the Magus himself that he may use them without reference to the
nature of the spirit, or of the operation; unless he requires an
exceptionally précisé spirit free of ail extraneous éléments, or one
whose nature is difficultly compatible with Tiphareth.</p>
<p>To show how these positions may be used in conjunction with the
spirals, suppose that you are invoking Hathor, Goddess of Love, to
descend upon the Altar. Standing on the square of Netzach you will make
your invocation to Her, and then dance an inward spiral deosil ending at
the foot of the altar, where you sink on your knees with your arms
raised above the altar as if inviting Her embrace. 1 2 3 *</p>
<p>To conclude, one may add that natural artistic ability, if you
possess it, forms an excellent guide. Ail Art is Magiek.</p>
<p>Isadora Duncan has this gift of gesture in a very high degree. Let
the reader study her dancing; if possible rather in private then in
public, and learn the superb “unconsciousness” — which is magical
consciousness — with which she suits the action to the melody. 8 T</p>

</ol>
<p>The knocks or knells are ail of the same character. They may be
described collectively — the différence between then consists only in
this, that the instrument with which they are made seals them with its
own spécial properties. It is of no great importance (even so) whether
they are made by clapping the hands or stamping the feet, by strokes of
one of the weapons, or by the theoretically appropriate instrument, the
bell. It may nevertheless be admitted that they become more important in
the ceremony if the Magician considers it worth while to take up 1 an
instrument whose single purpose is to produce them.</p>
<p>Let it first be laid down that a knock asserts a connection between
the Magician and the object which he strikes. Thus the use of the bell,
or of the hands, means that the Magician wishes to impress the
atmosphère of the whole circle with what has been or is about to be
done. He wishes to formulate his will in Sound, and radiate it in every
direction ; moreover, to influence that which lives by breath in the
sense of his purpose, and to summon it to bear witness to his Word. The
hands are used as symbols of his executive power, the bell to represent
his consciousness exalted into music. To strike with the wand is to
utter the fiat of création ; the cup vibrâtes with his delight in
receiving spiritual wine. A blow with the dagger is like the signal for
battle. The disk is used to express the throwing down of the price of
one’s purchase. To stamp with the foot is to déclaré one’s mastery of
the matter in hand. Similarly, any other form of giving knocks has its
own virtue. From the above examples the intelligent student will hâve
perceived the method of interpreting each individual case that may corne
in question.</p>
<p>As above said, the object struck is the object impressed. Thus, a
blow upon the altar affirms that he has complied with the laws of his
operation. To strike the lamp is to summon the Light divine. Thus for
the rest.</p>
<p>It must also be observed that many combinations of ideas are made
possible by this convention. To strike the wand within the cup is to
apply the Creative will to its proper complément, and so</p>

<p>erform the Great Work by the formula of Régénération. To trike with
the hand on the dagger déclarés that one demands he use of the dagger as
a tocl to extena one’s executive power. The reader will recall how
Siegfried smote Nothung, the sword of Need, upon the lance of Wotan. By
the action Wagner, who was instructed how to apply magical formulæ by
one of the heads of our Order, intended his hearers to understand that
the reign of authority and paternal power had corne to an end 5 that the
new master of the world was intellect.</p>
<p>The general object of a knock or a knell is to mark a stage in the
ceremony. Sasaki Shigetz tells us in his essay on Shinto that the
Japanese are accustomed to clap their hands four times “to drive away
evil spirits”. He explains that what really happens is that the sudden
and sharp impact of the Sound throws the mind into an alert activity
which enables it to break loose from the obsession of its previous mood.
It is aroused to apply itself aggressively to the ideas which had
oppressed it. There is there- fore a perfectly rational interprétation
of the psychological power of the knock.</p>
<p>In a Magical ceremony the knock is employed for much the same
purpose. The Magician uses it like the chorus in a Greek play. It helps
him to make a clean eut, to turn his attention from one part of his work
to the next.</p>
<p>So much for the general character of the knock or knell, Even this
limited point of view offers great opportunities to the resourceful
Magician. But further possibilities lie to our hand. It is not usually
désirable to attempt to convey anything except emphasis, and possibly
mood, by varying the force of the blow. It is obvious, moreover, that
there is a natural correspondence between the hard loud knock of
imperious command on the one hand, and the soft slurred knock of
sympathetic compréhension on the other. It is easy to distinguish
between the bang of the outraged creditor at the front, and the hushed
tap of the lover at the bedroom, door. Magical theory cannot here add.
instruction to instinct.</p>
<p>But a knock need not be single j the possible combinations are
evidently infinité. We need only discuss the general principles of
determining what number of strokes will be proper in any case,</p>
<p>84 -</p>
<p>and how we may interrupt any sériés so as to express our idea by
means of structure.</p>
<p>The general rule is that a single knock has no spécial significance
as such, because unity is omniform. It represents Kether, which is the
source of ail things equally without partaking of any quality by which
we discriminate one thing from another. Continuing on these lines, the
number of knocks will refer to the Sephira or other idea Qabalistically
cognate with that number. Thus, 7 knocks will intimate Venus, 11 the
Great Work, 17 the Trinity of Fathers, and 19 the Féminine Principle in
its most general sense.</p>
<p>Analyzing the matter a little further, we remark firstly that a
battery of too many knocks is confusing, as well as liable to over-
weight the other parts of the ritual. In practice, 11 is about the
limit. It is usually not difficult to arrange to cover ail necessary
ground with that number.</p>
<p>Secondly, each is so extensive in scope, and includes aspects so
diverse from a practical standpoint that our danger lies in vagueness. A
knock should be well definedj its meaning should be précisé. The very
nature of knocks suggests smartness and accuracy. We must therefore
devise some means of making the sequence significant of the spécial
sense which may be appropriate. Our only resource is in the use of
intervals.</p>
<p>It is evidently impossible to attain great variety in the smaller
numbers. But this fact illustrâtes the excellence of our system. There
is only one way of striking 2 knocks, and this fact agréés with the
nature of Chokmah; there is only one way of creating. We can express
only ourselves, although we do so in duplex form. But there are three
ways of striking 3 knocks, and these 3 ways correspond to the threefold
manner in which Binah can receive the créative idea. There are three
possible types of triangle. We may understand an idea either as an unity
tripartite, as an unity dividing itself into a duality, or as a duality
harmonized into an unity. Any of these methods may be indicated by 3
equal knocks $ 1 followed, after a pause, by 2; and 2 followed, after a
pause, by 1.</p>
<p>As the nature of the number becomes more complex, the possible
varieties increase rapidly. There are numerous ways of striking 6, each
of which is suited to the nature of the several</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>aspects of Tiphareth. We may leave the détermination o£ these points
to the ingenuity of the student.</p>
<p>The most generally useful and adaptable battery is composed o£ il
strokes. The principal reasons for this are as follows: Firstly&gt; n is
the number of Magick in itself. It is therefore suitable to ail types of
operation. Secondly , it is the sacred number par excellence of the new
Aeon. As it is written in the Book of the Law: “Eleven, as ail their
numbers who are of us.” Thirdly , it is the number of the letters of the
Word ABRAHADABRA, which is the Word of the Aeon. The structure of this
Word is such that it expresses the Great Work, in every one of its
aspects. Lastly&gt; it is possible thereby to express ail possible
spheres of operation, whatever their nature. This is effected by making
an équation between the number of the Sephira and the différence between
that number and n. For example, 2°=9° is the formula of the grade of
initiation corresponding to Yesod. Yesod represents the instability of
air, the sterility of the moonj but these qualities are balanced in it
by the stability implied in its position as the Foundation, and by its
function of génération. This complex is further equilibrated by
identifying it with the number 2 of Chokmah, which possesses the airy
quality, being the Word, and the lunar quali ty, being the reflection of
the sun of Kether as Yesod is of the sun of Tiphareth. It is the wisdom
which is the foundation by being création. This entire cycle of ideas is
expressed in the double formula 2°=9°, 9° =2 ° i and any of these ideas
may be selected and articulated by a suitable battery.</p>
<p>We may conclude with a single illustration of how the above
principles may be put into practice. Let us suppose that the Magician
contemplâtes an operation for the purpose of helping his mind to resist
the tendency to wander. This will be a work of Yesod. But he must
emphasize the stability of that Sephira as against the Airy quality
which it possesses. His first action will be to put the 9 under the
protection of the 2; the battery at this point will be 1-9-1. But this 9
as it stands is suggestive of the changefulness of the moon. It may
occur to him to divide this into 4 and 5, 4 being the number of fixity,
law, and authoritative power 5 and 5 that of courage, energy, and
triumph of the spirit</p>
<p>86 —</p>
<p>over the éléments. He will reflect, moreover, that 4 is symbolic of
the stability of matter, while 5 expresses the same idca with regard to
motion. At this stage the battery will appear as 1-2-5-2-1. After due
considération he will probably conclude that to split up the central 5
would tend to destroy the simplicity of his formula, and décidé to use
it as it stands. The possible alternative would be to make a single
knock the centre of his battery as if he appealed to the ultimate
immutability of Kether, invoking that unity by placing a fourfold knock
on either side of it. In this case, his battery would be 1-4-1-4-1. He
will naturally hâve been careful to preserve the balance of each part of
the battery against the corresponding part. This would be particularly
necessary in an operation such as we hâve chosen for our example.</p>

<p>The essential magical work, apart from any particular operation, is
the proper formation of the Magical Being or Body of Light. This process
will be discussed at some length in Chapter XVIII.</p>
<p>We will here assume that the magician has succeeded in developing his
Body of Light until it is able to go anyy/here and do anything. There
will, however, be a certain limitation to his work, because he has
formed his magical body from the fine matter of his own element.
Therefore, although he may be able to penetrate the utmost recesses of
the heavens, or conduct vigorous combats with the most unpronounceable
démons cf the pit, it may be impossible for him to do as much as knock a
vase from a mantel- piece. His magical body is composed of matter too
tenuous to affect directly the gross matter of which illusions such as
tables and chairs are made. 1</p>
<p>I. The one really easy “physical” operation which the Body of Light
can perform is “Congressus subtilis”. The émanations of the “Body of
Desire” of the material being whom one visits are, if the visit be
agreeabîe, so potent that one spontaneously gains substance in the
embrace. There</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>There has been a good deal of discussion in the past within the
Colleges of the Holy Ghost, as to whether it would be quite legitimate
to seek to transcend this limitation. One need not présumé to pass
judgment. One can leave the decision to the will of each magician.</p>
<p>The Book of the Dead contains many chapters intended to enable the
magical entity of a man who is dead, and so deprived (according to the
theory of death then current) of the material vehicle for executing his
will, to take on the form of certain animais, such as a golden hawk or a
crocodile, and in such form to go about the earth “taking his pleasure
among the living.” * 1 As a general rule, material was supplied out of
which he could construct the party of the second part aforesaid,
hereinafter referred to as the hawk.</p>
<p>We need not, however, consider this question of death. It may often
be convenient for the living to go about the world in some such
incognito. Now, then, conceive of this magical body as créative force,
seeking manifestation; as a God, seeking incarnation.</p>
<p>There are two ways by which this aim may be effected. The first
method is to build up an appropriate body from its éléments. This is,
generally speaking, a very hard thing to do, because the physical
constitution of any material being with much power is, or at least
should be, the outcome of âges of évolution. However, there is a lawful
method of producing an homunculus which is taught in a certain secret
organization, perhaps known to some of those who may read this, which
could very readily be adapted to some such purpose as we are now
discussing.</p>
<p>The second method sounds very easy and amusing. You take some
organism already existing, which happens to be suitable to your purpose.
You drive out the magical being</p>
<p>are many cases on record of Children having been born as the resuit
of such unions. See the work of De Sinistrari on Incubi and Succubi for
a discussion of analogous phenomena.</p>

transla¬ tions of certain classical Egyptian rituals.</p>

</ul>
<p>which inhabits il, and take possession. To do this by force is
neither easy nor justifiable, because the magical being of the other was
incarnated in accordance with its Will. And “Thou hast no right but to
do thy Will.” One should hardly strain this sentence to make one’s own
will include the will to upset somebody else’s will! 1 Moreover, it is
extremely difficult thus to expatriate another magical being ; for
though, unless it is a complété microcosm like a human being, it cannot
be called a star, it is a little bit of a star, and a part of the body
of Nuit.</p>
<p>But there is no call for ail this frightfulness. There is no need to
knock the girl down, unless she refuses to do what you want, and she
will always comply if you say a few nice things to her. 2 You can always
use the body inhabited by an elemental, such as an eagle, hare, wolf, or
any convenient animal, by making a very simple compact. You take over
the res- ponsibility for the animal, thus building it up into your own
magical hierarchy. This represents a tremendous gain to the animal. 3 It
competely fulfils its ambition by an alliance of this extremely intimate
sort with a Star. The magician, on the other hand, is able to transform
and retransform himself in a thousand ways by accepting a retinue of
such adhérents. In this way the projection of the “astral” or Body of
Light may be made absolutely tangible and practical. At the same time,
the magician must réalisé that in undertaking the Karma of any
elemental, he is assuming a very serious responsibility• The bond which
unités him with that elemental is love; and, though it is only a small
part of the outfit of the magician, it is the whole of the outfit of the
elemental. He will, therefore, suffer intensely in case of any error or
misfortune occuring to his protégée. This feeling is rather peculiar. It
is quite instinctive with the best men. They</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>Of the Bloody Sacrifice : and Matters Cognate.</p>
<p>It is necessary for us to consider carefully the problems con- necœd
with the bloody sacrifice, for this question is indeed traditionally
important in Magick. Nigh ail ancient Magick revolves around this
matter. In particular ail the Osirian religions — the rites of the Dying
God — refer to this, The slaying of Osiris and Adonis ; the mutilation
of Attis; the cuits of Mexico and Peruj the story of Hercules or
Melcarth; the legends of Dionysus and of Mithra, are ail connected with
this one idea. In the Hebrew religion we find the same thing inculcated.
The first ethical lesson in the Bible is that the only sacrifice
pleasing to the Lord is the sacrifice of bloodj Abel, who made this,
finding favour with the Lord, while Cain, who offered cabbages, was
rather naturally considered a cheap sport. The idea recurs again and
again. We hâve the sacrifice of the Passover, following on the story of
Abraham s being commanded to sacrifice his firstborn son, with the idea
of the substitution of animal for human life. The annual ceremony of the
two goats carries out this in perpetuity. And we see again the
domination of this idea in the romance of Esther, where Haman and
Mordecai are the two goats or gods; and ultimately in the présentation
of the rite of Purim in Palestine, where Jésus and Barabbas happened to
be the Goats in that particular year of which we hear so much, without
agreement on the date.</p>
<p>This subject must be studied in the “Golden Bough”, where it is most
learnedly set forth by Dr. J. G. Frazer.</p>
<p>Enough has now been said to show that the bloody sacrifice has from
time immémorial been the most considered part of Magick.</p>
<p>92 —</p>
<p>The ethics of the thing appear to hâve concerned no one; nor, to tell
the truth, need they do so. As St. Paul says, “Without shedding of blood
there is no remission” ; and who are we to argue with St. Paul? But ?
after ail that, it is open to any one to hâve any opinion that he likes
upon the subject, or any other subject, thank God! At the same time, it
is most necessary to study the business, whatever we may be going to do
about it; for our ethics themselves will naturally dépend upon our
theory of the universe. If we were quite certain, for example, that
everybody went to heaven when he died, there could be no serious
objection to murder or suicide, as it is generally conceded—by those who
know neither — that earth is not such a pleasant place as heaven.</p>
<p>However, there is a mystery concealed in this theory of the bloody
sacrifice which is of great importance to the student, and we therefore
make no further apology. We should not hâve made even this apology for
an apology, had it not been for the solicitude of a pious young friend
of great austerity of character who insisted that the part of this
chapter which now follows — the part which was originally written —
might cause us to be misunderstood. This must not be.</p>
<p>The blood is the life. This simple statement is explained by the
Hindus by saying that the blood is the principal vehicle of vital Prana.
1 There is some ground for the belief that there is a definite substance
2 , not isolated as yet, whose presence makes ail</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prana or “force” is often used as a generic term for ail kinds of
subtle energy. The prana of the body is only one of its “vayus”. Vayu
means air or spirit. The idea is that ail bodily forces are manifesta¬
tions of the finer forces of the more real body, this real body being a
subtle and invisible thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . This substance need not be conceived as “material” in the crude
sense of Victorian science; we now know that such phenomena as the rays
and émanations of radioactive substances occupy an intermediate
position. For instance, mass is not, as once supposed, necessarily
imper¬ méable to mass, and matter itself can be only interpreted in
terms of motion. So, as to “prana”, one might hypothesize a phenomenon
in the ether analogous to isomerism. We already know of bodies
chemically identical whose molecular structure makes one active, another
inactive, to certain reagents. Metals can be “tired” or even “killed” as
to some of their properties, without discoverable Chemical change. One
can</p>
<p>— 93</p>
<p>the différence between live and dead matter. We pass by with deserved
contempt the pseudo-scientific experiments of American charlatans who
daim to hâve established that weight is lost at the moment of death, and
the unsupported statements of alleged clairvoyants that they hâve seen
the soûl issuing like a vapour from the mouth of persons in articulo
mortis; but his expériences as an explorer hâve convinced the Master
Therion that méat loses a notable portion of its nutritive value within
a very few minutes after the death of the animal, and that this loss
proceeds with ever-diminishing rapidity as time goes on. It is further
generally conceded that live food, such as oysters, is the most rapidly
assimilable and most concentrated form of energy. * 1 Laboratory
experiments in food-values seem to be almost worthless, for reasons
which we cannot here enter into; the general testimony of mankind
appears a safer guide.</p>
<p>It would be unwise to condemn as irrational the practice of those
savages who tear the heart and liver from an adversary, and devour them
while yet warm. In any case it was the theory of</p>
<p>u kill” Steel, and “raise it from the dead”; and flies drowned in
ice- water can be resuscitated. That it should be impossible to create
high organic life is scientifically unthinkable, and the Master Therion
believes it to be a matter of few years indeed before this is done in
the laboratory. Already we restore the apparently drowned. Why not those
dead from such causes as syncope? If we understood the ultimate physics
and chemistry of the brief moment of death we could get hold of the
force in some way, supply the missing element, reverse the electrical
conditions or what not. Already we prevent certain kinds of death by
supplying wants, as in the case of Thyroid.</p>
<p>I. One can become actually drunk on oysters, by chewing them
completely. Rigor seems to be a symptom of the loss of what I may call
the Alpha-energy and makes a sharp break in the curve. The Beta and
other energies dissipate more slowly. Physiologists should make it their
hrst duty to measure these phenomena; for their study is evidently a
direct line of research into the nature of Life. The analogy between the
living r.nd complex molécules of the Uranium group of inorganic and the
Protoplasm group of organic éléments is extremely suggestive. The
faculties of growth, action, self-recuperation, etc., must be ascribed
to similar properties in both cases; and as we hâve detected, measured
and partially explained radioactivity, it must be possible to contrive
means of doing the same for Life.</p>
<p>94 —</p>
<p>the ancient Magicians, that any living being is a storehouse of
energy varying in quantity according to the size and health of the
animal, and in quality according to its mental and moral character. At
the death of the animal this energy is liberated suddenly.</p>
<p>The animal should therefore be killed 1 within the Circle, or the
Triangle, as the case may be. so that its energy cannot escape. An
animal should be selected whose nature accords with that of the ceremony
— thus, by sacrificing a female lamb one would not obtain any appreciate
quantity of the fierce energy useful to a Magician who was invoking
Mars. In such a case a ram 2 3 would be more suitable. And this ram
should be virgin — the whole potential of its original total energy
should not hâve been diminished in any way. ;; For the highest spiritual
working one must accordingly choose that victim which contains the
greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect innocence and high
intelligence 4 is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is a mistake to suppose that the victim is injured. On the
contrary, this is the most blessed and merci fui of ail deaths, for the
elemental spirit is directly built up into Godhead — the exact goal of
its efforts through countless incarnations. On the other hand, the
practice cf torturing animais to death in order to obtain the elemental
as a slave is indefensible, utterly black magic of the very worst kind,
involving as it does a metaphysical basis of dualism. There is, however,
no objection to dualism or black magic when they are properly
understood. See the account of the Master Therion’s Great Magical
Retirement by Lake Pasquaney, where He “crucified a toad in the Basilisk
abode”.</p></li>
<li><p>A wolf would be still better in the case of Mars. See 777 for the
correspondences between various animais and the “32 Paths” of
Nature.</p></li>
<li><p>There is also the question of its magical freedom. Sexual
intercourse créâtes a link between its exponents, and therefore a
responsi- bility.</p></li>
<li><p>It appears from the Magical Records of Frater Perdurabo that He
made this particular sacrifice on an average about 150 times every year
between 1912 e. v. and 1928 e. v. Contrast J. K. Huyman’s “Là- Bas”,
where a perverted form of Magic of an analogous order is
described.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“It is the sacrifice of oneself spiritually. And the intelligence and
innocence of that male child are the perfect understanding of the
Magician, his one aim, without lust of resuit. And male he must be,
because what</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>For évocations it would be more convenient to place the blood of the
victim in the Triangle — the idea being that the spirit might obtain
from the blood this subtle but physical substance which was the
quintessence of its life in such a manner as to enable it to take on a
visible and tangible shape. * 1</p>
<p>Those magiciens wiio object to the use of blood bave endeavored to
replace it with incense. For such a purpose the incense of Abramelin may
be burnt in large quantities. Dittany of Crete is also a valuable
medium. Both these incenses are very catholic in their nature, and
suitable for almost any materialization.</p>
<p>But the bloody sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more efficacious;
and for nearly ail purposes human sacrifice is the best. The truly great
Magician will be able to use his own blood, or possibly that of a
disciple, and that without sacrificing the physical life irrevocably. 2
An example of this sacrifice is given in Chapter 44 of Liber 333. This
Mass may be recommended generally for daiiy practice.</p>
<p>One last Word on this subject. There is a Magical Operation of
maximum importance: the Initiation of a New Aeon. When it becomes
necessary to utter a Word, the whole Planet must be bathed in blood.
Before man is ready to accept the Law of Thelema, the Great War must be
fought. This Bloody Sacrifice is the critical point of the Worïd-</p>

<li>Such details, however, may safely be left to the good sense of the
Student. Expérience here as elsewhere is the best teacher. In the
Sacrifice during Invocation, however, it may be said without fear of
contradiction that the death of the victim should coincide with the

<p>II</p>
<p>There is another sacrifice with regard to which the Adepts hâve
always maintained the most profound secrecy. It is the suprême mystery
of practical Magick. Its name is the Formula of the Rosy Cross. In this
case the victim is always — in a certain sense — the Magician himself,
and the sacrifice must coïncide with the utterance of the most sublime
and secret name of the God whom he wishes to invoke.</p>
<p>Properly performed, it never fails of its effect. But it is difficult
for the beginner to do it satisfactorily, because it is a great effort
for the mind to remain concentrated upon the purpose of the ceremony.
The overcoming of this difficulty lends most powerful aid to the
Magician.</p>
<p>It is unwise for him to attempt it until he has received regular
initiation in the true 2 Order of the Rosy Cross,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Note : This paragraph was written in the summer of 1911 e.v.,
just three years before its fulfilment.</p></li>
<li><p>It is here désirable to warn the render against the numerous
false orders which hâve impudently assumed the name of Rosicrucian. The
Masonic Societas Rosicruciana is honest and harmless; and makes no false
pretences; if its members happen as a rule to be pompous busy-bodies,
enlarging the borders of their phylacteries, and scrupulous about
cleansing the outside of the cup and the platter; if the masks of the
Offîcers in their Mysteries suggest the Owl, the Cat, the Parrot, and
the Cuckoo, while the Robe of their Chief Magus is a Lion’s Skin, that
is their affair. But those orders run by persons claiming to represent
the True Ancient Fraternity are common swindles. The représentatives of
the late S. L. Mathers (Count McGregor) are the phosphorescence of the
rotten wood of a branch which was lopped off the tree at the end of the
içth century. Those of Papus (Dr. Encausse), Stanislas de Guaita and
Péladan, merit respect as serious, but lack full knowledge and
authority. The “Ordo Rosae Crucis” is a mass of ignorance and falsehood,
but this may be a deliberate device for masking itself. The test of any
Order is its attitude towards the Law of Thelema. The True Order
présents the True Symbols, but avoids attaching the True Name thereto;
it is only when the Postulant</p></li>

<p>and hé must hâve taken the vows with the fullest compréhension and
expérience of their meaning. It is also extremely désirable that he
should hâve attained an absolute degree of moral émancipation *, and
that purity of spirit which resnlts from a perfect understanding both of
the différences and harmonies of the planes upon the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>For this reason Frater Perdurabo has never dared to use this formula
in a fully cérémonial manner, save once only, on an occasion of
tremendous import, when, indeed, it was not He that made the offering,
but ONE in Him. For he perceived a grave defect in his moral character
which he has been able to overcome on the intellectual plane, but not
hitherto upon higher planes. Before the conclusion of writing this book
he will hâve done so. * 1 2 3</p>
<p>The practical details of the Bloody Sacrifice may be studied in
various ethnological manuals, but the general conclusions are summed up
in Frazer’s “Golden Bough”, which is strongly recommended to the
reader.</p>
<p>Actual cérémonial details likewise may be left to experiment. The
method of killing is practically uniform. The animal should be stabbed
to the heart, or its throat severed, in either case by the knife. Ail
other methods of killing are less efficacious; even in the case of
Crucifixion death is given by stabbing. 8</p>
<p>One may remark that warm-blooded animais only are used as victims:
with two principal exceptions. The first is the serpent, which is only
used in a very spécial Ritual ; 4 the second the magical beetles of
Liber Legis. (See Part IV.)</p>
<p>has taken irrevocable Oaths and been received formally, that he
discovers what Fraternity he has joined. If he hâve taken false symbols
for true, and find himself magically pledged to a gang of rascals, so
much the worse for him!</p>

<li><p>This results from the full acceptance of the Law of THELEMA,
persistently put into practice.</p></li>
<li><p>P. S. With the happiest results. P.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet one might devise methods of execution appropriate to the
Weapons : Stabbing or clubbing for the Lance or Wand, Drowning or
poîsoning for the Cup, Beheading for the Sword, Crushing for the Disk,
Burning for the Lamp, and so forth.</p></li>
<li><p>The Serpent is not realîy killed; it is seethed in an

<p>98</p>
<p>One word of warning is perhaps necessary for the begirmer. The victim
must be in perfect health — or its energy may be as it were poisoned. It
must also not be too large: * 1 2 3 the amount of energy disengaged is
almost unimaginably great, and out of ail anticipated proportion to the
strength of the animal. Con- sequently, the Magician may easily be
overwhelmed and obsessed by the force which he has let loose; it will
then probably manifest itself in its lowest and most objectionable form.
The most intense spirituality of purpose is absolutely essential to
safety.</p>
<p>In évocations the danger is not so great, as the Circle forms a
protection j but the circle in such a case must be protected, not only
by the names of God and the Invocations used at the same time, but by a
long habit of successful defence. s If you are easily disturbed or
alarmed, or if you hâve not yet overcome the ten- dency of the mind to

essen- tially itself. The idea is the transmission of life and wisdom
from a vehicle which has fulfilled its formula to one capable of further
extension. The development of a wild fruit by repeated plantings in
suitable soil is an analogous operation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The sacrifice (e.g.) of a bull is sufficient for a large number. of
people; hence it is commonly made in public ceremonies, and in some
initiations, e.g. that of a King, who needs force for his whole kingdom.

The danger is that one may get something which one does not want. This
is “bad” by définition. Nothing is in itself good or evil. The shields
of the Sabines which crushed Tarpeia were not murderous to them, but the
contrary. Her criticism of them was simply that they were what she did
not want in her Operation.</p></li>
<li><p>The habituai use of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram
(say, thrice daily) for months and years and constant assumption of the
God-form of Harpocrates (See Equinox, I, II and Liber 333, cap. XXV for
both these) should make the real circle , i.e. the Aura of the Magus,
impregnable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This Aura should be clean-cut, résilient, radiant, iridiscent,
brilliant, glittering. “A soap-bubble of razor-steel, streaming with
light from</p>

its incongruities: P.</p>
<p>“Frater Perdurabo, on the one occasion on which I was able to sec Him
as He really appears, was brighter than the Sun at noon. I fell
instantly to the floor in a swoon which lasted several hours, during
which I was initiated.” Soror A.*,. Cf. Rev. I, 12-17.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The whole idea of the Word Sacrifice, as commonly understaad,
rests upon an error and superstition, and is unscientific, besides being
metaphysically false. The law of Thelema has totally changed the Point
of View as to this matter. Unless you hâve thoroughly assimilated the
Formula of Horus, it is absolutely unsafe to meddle with this type of
Magick. Let the young Magician reflect upon the Conservation of Matter
and of Energy.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a traditional saying that whenever an Adept seems to
hâve made a straightforward, compréhensible statement, then is it most
certain that He means something entirely different. The Truth is
nevertheless clearly set forth in His Words: it is His simplicity that
baffles the unworthy. I hâve chosen the expressions in this Chapter in
such a way that it is likely to mislead those magicians who allow
selfish interests to cloud their intelligence, but to give useful hints
to such as are bound by the proper Oaths to devote their powers to
legitimate ends. Thou hast no right but to do thy will.” “It is a lie,
this folly against self.” The radical error of ail uninitiates is that
they define “self” as irreconciliably opposed to “not-self.” Each
élément of oneself is, on the contrary, stérile and without meaning,
until it fulfils itself, by “love under will”, in its counterpart in the
Macrocosm. To separate oneself from others is to destroy oneself; the
way to realize and to extend oneself is to lose that self — its sense of
separateness — in the other. Thus: Child plus food: this does not
preserve one at the expense of the other; it “destroys” or rather
changes both in order to fulfil both in the resuit of the operation — a
grown man. It is in fact impossible to preserve anything as it is by
positive action upon it. Its integrity demands inaction; and inaction,
résistance to change, is stagnation, death and dissolution due to the
internai putréfaction of the starved éléments.</p></li>

<p>100</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>r *</p>
<p>Of the Banishings:</p>
<p>And of the Purifications.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and had better corne first. Purity
means singleness. God is one. The wand is not a wand if it has something
sticking to it which is not an essential part of îtself. If you wish to
invoke Venus, you do not succeed if there are traces of Saturn mixed up
with it.</p>
<p>T-hat is a mere logical commonplace: in Magick one must go much
farther than this. One finds one’s analogy in electricity. If insulation
is imperfect, the whole current goes back to earth. It is useless to
plead that in ail those miles of wire there is only one-hundredth of an
inch unprotected. It is no good building a ship if the water can enter,
through however small a hole.</p>
<p>The first task of the Magician in every ceremony is therefore to
render his Circle absolutely impregnable. 1 If one littlest thought
intrude upon the mind of the Mystic, his concentration is absolutely
destroyed; and his consdousness remains on exactly the same level as the
Stockbroker’s. Even the smallest baby is incompatible with the virginity
of its mother. If you leave even a single spirit within the circle, the
effect of the conjuration will be entirely absorbed by it. 2</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See, however, the Essay on Truth in “Konx oin Pax”. The Circle (in
one aspect) asserts Duality, and emphasizes Division.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . While one remains exposed to the action of ail sorts of forces,
they more or less counterbalance each other, so that the general
equilib- rium, produced by évolution, is on the whole maintained. But if
we suppress ail but one, its action becomes irrésistible. Thus, the
pressure of</p>
<p>IOI</p>
<p>The Magician must therefore take the utmost care in the matter of
purification, firstly, of himself, secondly , of his instru¬ ments,
thirdly, of the place of working. Ancient Magicians recommended a
preliminary purification of from three days to many months. Durîng this
period of training they took the utmost pains with diet. They avoided
animal food, lest the elemental spirit of the animal should get into
their atmosphère. They practised sexual abstinence, lest they should be
influenced in any way by the spirit of the wife. Even in regard to the
excrements of the body they were equally carefulj in trimming the hair
and nails, they ceremonially destroyed * 1 the severed portion. They
fasted, so that the body itself might destroy anvthing extraneous to the
bare necessity of its existence. They purified the mind by spécial
prayers and conservations. They avoided the contamination of social
intercourse, especially the conjugal kind; and their servi tors were
disciples specially chosen and consecrated for the work.</p>
<p>In modem times our superior understanding of the essentials of this
process enables us to dispense to some extent with its external rigours;
but the internai purification must be even more carefully performed. We
may eat méat, provided that in doing so we affirm that we eat it in
order to strengthen us for the spécial purpose of our proposed
invocation. 2</p>
<p>the atmosphère would crush us if we “banished” that of our bodies;
and we should crumble to dust if we rebelled successfully against
cohésion. A man who is normally an “allround good sorr* often becomes
intolérable when he gets rid of his collection of vices; he is swept
into monomania by the spiritual pride which had been previously
restrained by counter- vailing passions. Again, there is a worse draught
when an ill-fitting door is closed than when it stands open. It is not
as necessary to protect his mother and his cattle from Don Juan as it
was from the Hermits of the Thebaid.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Such destruction should be by burning or other means which produces
a complété Chemical change. In so doing care should be taken to bless
and liberate the native elemental of the thing burnt. This maxim i c of
universal application.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . In an Abbey of Thelema we say “Wïll” before a meal. The formula
is as follows. “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>By thus avoiding those actions whiçli might excite the comment of our
neighbours we avoid the graver dangers of falling into spiritual
pride.</p>
<p>We hâve understood the saying: “To the pure ail things are pure”, and
we hâve learnt how to act up to it. We can analyse the mind far more
acutely than could the ancients, and we can therefore distinguish the
real and right feeling from its imitations. A man may eat méat from
self-indulgence, or in order to avoid the dangers of asceticism. We must
constantly examine our- selves, and assure ourselves that every action
is really subservient to the One Purpose.</p>
<p>It is ceremonially désirable to seal and affirm this mental purity by
Ritual, and accordingly the first operation in any actual ceremony is
bathing and robing, with appropriate words. The bath signifies the
removal of ail things extraneous or antagonistic to the one thought. The
putting on of the robe is the positive side of the same operation. It is
the assumption of the frame of mind suitable to that one thought.</p>
<p>A similar operation takes place in the préparation of every
instrument, as has been seen in the Chapter devoted to that subject. In
the préparation of the place of working, the same considérations apply.
We first remove from that place ail objects; and we then put into it
those objects, and only those</p>
<p>Law.” “What is thy Will?” “It is my will to eat and drink” “To what
end?” “That my body may be fortified thereby.” “To what end?” “That I
may accomplish the Great Work.” “Love is the law, love under will.”
“Fall to!” This may be adapted as a monologue. One may also add the
inquiry “What is the Great Work?” and answer appropriately, when it
seems useful to specify the nature of the Operation in progress at the
time. The point is to seize every occasion of bringing every available
force to bear upon the objective of the assault. It does not matter what
the force is (by any standard of judgment) so long as it plays its
proper part in securing the success of the general purpose. Thus, even
laziness may be used to increase our indifférence to interfering
impulses, or envy to counteract carelessness. See Liber CLXXV, Equinox
I, VII, P . 37 - This is especially true, since the forces are destroyed
by the process. That is, one destroys a compiex which in itself is
“evil” and puts its éléments to the one right use.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>objects, which are necessary. During many days we occupy ourselves in
this process of cleansing and consécration; and this again is confirmed
in the actual ceremony.</p>
<p>The cleansed and consecrated M agi ci an takes his cleansed and
consecrated instruments into that cleansed and consecrated place, and
there proceeds to repeat that double ceremony in the ceremony itself,
which has these same two main parts. The first part of every ceremony is
the banishing; the second, the invoking. The same formula is repeated
even in the ceremony of banishing itself, for in the banishing ritual of
the pentagram we not only command the démons to départ, but invoke the
Archangels and their hosts to act as guardians of the Circle during our
pre-occupa- tion with the ceremony proper.</p>
<p>In more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to banish everything by
name. Each element, each planet, and each sign, perhaps even the
Sephiroth themselves; ail are removed, including the very one which we
wished to invoke, for that force as existing in Nature is always impure.
But this process, being long and wearisome, is not altogether advisable
in actual working. It is usually sufficient to perform a general
banishing, and to rely upon the aid of the guardians invoked. Let the
banishing therefore be short, but in no wise slurred — for it is useful
as it tends to produce the proper attitude of mind for the invocations.
“The Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram” (as now rewritten, Liber 333,
Cap. XXV) is the best to use. 1 Only the four éléments are specifically
mentioned, but these four éléments contain the planets and the signs 2 —
the four éléments are Tetragrammaton; and Tetragrammaton is the
Universe. This spécial précaution is, however, necessary: make exceeding
sure that the ceremony of banishing is effective !</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See also the Ritual called “The Mark of the Beast” given in an
Appendix. But this is pantomorphous.</p></li>
<li><p>The signs and the planets, of course, contain, the éléments. It
is important to remember this fact, as it helps one to grasp what ail
these terms really mean. None of the “Thirty-two Paths” is a simple
idea; each one is a combination, differentiated from the others by its
structure smd proportions. The chemical éléments are similarly
constituted, as the critics of Magick hâve at last been compelled to
admit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>104 —</p>
<p>Be alert and on your guard ! Watch before you pray ! The feeling of
success in banishing, once acquired, is unmistakable.</p>
<p>At the conclusion, it is usually well to pause for a few moments, and
to make sure once more that every thing necessary to the ceremony is in
its right place. The Magician may then proceed to the final consécration
of the furniture of the Temple. 1</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>That is, of the spécial arrangement of that furniture. Each object
should hâve been separately consecrated beforehand. The ritual here in
question should summarize the situation, and devote the particular
arrange¬ ment to its purpose by invoking the appropriate forces. Let it
be well remembered that each object is bound by the Oaths of its
original consé¬ cration as such. Thus, if a Pantacle has been made
sacred to Venus, it cannot be used in an operation of Mars; the Energy
of the Exorcist would be taken up in overcoming the opposition of the
“Karma” or inertia therein inhérent.</li>

<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>Of the Consécrations :</p>
<p>WlTH AN ACCOUNT OF THE</p>
<p>Nature and Nurture of the Magical Link.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Consécration is the active dedication of a thmg to a single purpose.
Ranishing prevents its use for any other purpose, but it remains inert
until consecrated. Purification is performed by water, and banishing by
air, whose weapon is the sword. Consécra¬ tion is performed by fire,
usually symbolised by the holy oil. 1</p>
<p>In most extant magical rituals the two operations are per¬ formed at
once; or (at least) the banishing has the more important place, and
greater pains seem to be taken with it; but as the student advances to
Adeptship the banishing will diminish in importance, for it will no
longer be so necessary. The Circle of the Magician will hâve been
perfected by his habit of Magical work. In the truest sense of that
Word, he will never step outside the Circle during his whole life. But
the consécration, being the application of a positive force, can always
be raised to a doser approximation to perfection. Complété success in
banishing is soon attained; but there can be no completeness in the
advance to holiness.</p>
<p>I. The general conception is that the three active éléments
co-operate to affect earth; but earth itself may be employed as an
instrument. Its function is solidification. The use of the Pentacle is
indeed very necessary in somc types of operation, especially those whose
object involves mani¬ festation in matter, and the fixation in (more or
less) permanent form of the subtle forces of Nature.</p>
<p>The method of consécration is very simple. Takc thc wand, or the holy
oil, and draw upon the object to be consec rated the suprême symbol of
the force to which y on dedicate it. Confirm this dedication in words,
invoking the appropriate God to indwell that pure temple which you hâve
prepared for Him. Do this with fervour and love, as if to balance the
icy detachment which is the proper mental attitude for banishing. 1</p>
<p>The words of purification are: Asperges me, Therion, hyssopo, et
mundabor; lavabis me, et super nivem dealbabor.</p>
<p>Those of consécration are: Accendat in nobis Therion ignem sui amoris
et flammam aeternae caritatis. 2</p>
<p>These, as initiâtes of the VIT of O.T.O. are aware, mean more than
appears.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>It is a strange circumstance that no Magical writer has hitherto
treated the immensely important subject of the Magical Link. It might
almost be called the Missing Link. It has apparently always been taken
for granted; only lay writers on Magick like Dr. J. G. Frazer hâve
accorded the subject its full importance.</p>
<p>Let us try to make considérations of the nature of Magick in a
strictly scientific spirit, as well as, deprived of the guidance of
antiquity, wc may.</p>
<p>What is a Magical Operation? It may be defined as any event in Nature
which is brought to pass by Will. We must not exclude potato-growing or
banking from our définition.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Hebrew legends furnish us with the reason for the respective
virtues of water and lire. The world was purified by water at the
Deluge, and will be consecrated by lire at the last Judgment. Not until
that is fmished can the real ceremony begin.</p></li>
<li><p>These may now advantageously be replaced by (a) “p ure will
unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of resuit, is every way
perfect” (CCXX, I, 44) to banish; and (b) “I am uplifted in thine heart;
and the kisses of the stars rain hard upon thy body.” (CCXX, II, 62) to
consecrate. For the Book of the Law contains the Suprême
Spells.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 107</p>
<p>Let us take a very simple example of a Magical Act: that of a man
blowing his nose. What are the conditions of the success of the
Operation? Firstly, that the man’s Will should be to blow his nose;
secondly, that he should hâve a nose capable of being blown; thirdly,
that he should hâve at command an apparatus capable of expressing his
spiritual Will in terms of material force, and applying that force to
the object which he desires to affect. His Will may be as strong and
concentrated as that of Jupiter, and his nose may be totally incapable
of résistance; but unless the link is made by the use of his nerves and
muscles in accordance with psychological, physiological, and physical
law, the nose will remain unblown through ail eternity.</p>
<p>Writers on Magick hâve been unsparing in their efforts to instruct us
in the préparation of the Will, but they seem to hâve imagined that no
further précaution was necessary. There is a striking case of an
épidémie of this error whose history is familiar to everybody. I refer
to Christian Science, and the cognate doctrines of “mental healing” and
the like. The theory of such people, stripped of dogmatic furbelows, is
perfectly good Magic of its kind, its negroid kind. The idea is correct
enough: matter is an illusion created by Will through mind, and
consequently susceptible of alteration at the behest of its creator. But
the practice has been lacking. They hâve not developed a scientific
technique for applying the Will. It is as if they expected the steam of
Watts’ kettle to convey people from place to place without the trouble
of inventing and using locomotives.</p>
<p>Let us apply these considérations to Magick in its restricted sense,
the sense in which it was always understood until the Master Therion
extended it to cover the entire operations of Nature.</p>
<p>What is the theory implied in such rituals as those of the Goetia?
What does the Magician do? He applies himself to invoke a God, and this
God compels the appearance of a spirit whose function is to perform the
Will of the Magician at the moment. There is no trace of what may be
called machinery in the method. The exorcist hardly takes the pains of
preparing a material basis for the spirit to incarnate except the bare
connection</p>
<p>-— 108</p>
<p>of himself with his sigil. It is apparently assumed that the spirit
already possesses the means of working on matter. The conception seems
to be that of a schoolboy who asks his father to tell the butler to do
something for him. In other words, the theory is grossly animistic. The
savage tribes described by Frazer had a far more scientific theory. The
same may be said of witches, who appear to hâve been wiser than the
thaumaturgists who despised them. - They at least made waxen images —
iden- tified by baptism — of the people they wished to control. They at
least used appropriate bases for Magical manifestations, such as blood
and other vehicles of animal force, with those of vegetable virtue such
as herbs. They were also careful to put their bewitched products into
actual contact — material or astral — with their victims. The classical
exorcists, on the contrary, for ail their learning, were careless about
this essential condition. They acted as stupidly as people who should
Write business letters and omit to post them.</p>
<p>It is not too much to say that this failure to understand the
conditions of success accounts for the discrédit into which Magick fell
until Eliphas Levi undertook the task of re-habilitating it two
générations ago. But even he (profoundly as he studied, and luminously
as he expounded, the nature of Magick considered as a universal formula)
paid no attention whatever to that question of the Magical Link, though
he everywhere implies that it is essential to the Work. He evaded the
question by making the petitio principii of assigning to the Astral
Light the power of transmitting vibrations of ail kinds. He nowhere
enters into detail as to how its effects are produced. He does not
inform us as to the qualitative or quantitative laws of this light. (The
scientifically trained student will observe the analogy between Levi’s
postulate and that of ordinary science in re the luminiferous
ether.)</p>
<p>It is déplorable that nobody should hâve recorded in a syste- matic
form the results of our investigations of the Astral Light. We hâve no
account of its properties or of the laws which obtain in its sphere. Yet
these are sufficiently remarkable. We may briefly notice that, in the
Astral Light, two or more objects can</p>
<p>— 109 —</p>
<p>occupy the samc space at the same time without interferîng wkh each
other or losing their outlines.</p>
<p>In that Light, objects can change their appearance completely without
suffering change of Nature. The same thing can reveal itself in an
infinité number of different aspects5 in fart, it iden¬ tifies itself by
so doing, much as a writer or a painter reveals himself in a succession
of novels or pictures, each of which is wholly himself and nothing else,
but himself under varied conditions, though each appears utterly
différent from its fellows. In that Light one is “swift without feet and
flying without wings”; one can travel without moving, and communicate
without conventional means of expression. One is insensible to heat,
cold, pain, and other forms of appréhension, at least in the shapes
which are familiar to us in our bodily vehicles. They exist, but they
are appreciated by us, and they affect us, in a different manner. In the
Astral Light we are bound by what is, super- ficially, an entirely
different sériés of laws. We meet with obstacles of a strange and subtle
character ; and we overcome them by an energy and cunning of an order
entirely alien to that which serves us in earthly life. In that Light,
symbols are not conventions but realities, yet (on the contrary) the
beings whom we encounter are only symbols of the realities of our own
nature. Our operations in that Light are really the adventures of our
own personified thoughts. The universe is a projection of ourse!ves; an
image as unreal as that of our faces in a mirror, yet, like that face,
the necessary form of expression thereof, not to be altered save as we
alter ourselves. 1 The mirror may</p>
<p>I. This passage must not be understood as asserting that the Universe
is pureîy subjective. On the contrary, the Magical Theory accepts the
absolute reality of ail things in the most objective sense. But ail
perceptions are neither the observer nor the observed; they are repré¬
sentations of the relation between them. We cannot affirm any quality in
an object as being independent of our sensorium, or as being in itself
that which it seems to us. Nor can we assume that what we coenize is
more than a partial phantom of its cause. We cannot even déterminé the
meaning of such ideas as motion, or distinguish between time and space,
except in relation to some particular observer. For example, if I fire
a</p>
<p>IÏO</p>
<p>be distorted, dull, cloudcd, or cracked j and to tins extrait, due
reflection of ourselves may be false even in respect of its symbolk
présentation. In that Light, therefore, ail that we do is to discover
ourselves by means of a sequence of hieroglyphics, and the changes which
we apparently operate are in an objective sense illusions.</p>
<p>But the Light serves us in this way. It enables us to see ourselves,
and therefore to aid us to initiate ourselves by showing us what we are
doing. In the same way a watchmaker uses a lens, though it exaggerates
and thus falsifies the image of the System of wheels which he is trying
to adjust. In the same way, a writer emplovs arbitrary characters
according to a meaningless convention in order to enable his reader by
retranslating them to obtain an approximation to his idea.</p>
<p>Such are a few of the principal characteristics of the Astral Light.
Its quantitative laws are much less dissimilar from those of material
physics. Magicians hâve too often been foolish enough to suppose that
ail classes of Magical Operations were equally easy. They seem to hâve
assumed that the “almighty power of God” was an infinité quantity in
presence of which ail finites were equally insignifiant. “One day is
with the Lord as a thousand years” is their first law of Motion. “Faith
can move mountains” they sav, and disdain to measure either the faith or
the mountains. If you can kill a chicken by Magic, why not destroy an
army with equal exertion? “With God ail things are possible.”</p>
<p>This absurdity is an error of the same class as that mentioned above.
The facts are wholly opposed. Two and two make four in the Astral as
rigorously as anywhere else. The distance of one’s Magical target and
the accuracy of one’s Magical rifle are factors in the success of one’s
Magical shooting in just the same way as at Bisley. The law of Magical
gravitation is as rigid as that of Newton. The law of Inverse Squares
may not apply; but some</p>
<p>cannon twice at an interval of 3 hours, an observer on the Sun would
note a différence of some 200,000 miles in space between the shots,
while to me they seem “in the same place.” Moreover, I am incapable of
perceiving any phenomenon except by means of the arbitrary instruments
of my senses; it is thus correct to say that the Uni verse as I know it
is subjective, without denying its objectivity.</p>
<p>lïî</p>
<p>such law does apply. So it is for everything. You cannot produce a
thunderstorm unless tlie materials exist in the air at the time, and a
Magician who could make rain in Cumberland might fail lament- ably in
the Sahara. One might make a talisman to win the love of a shop-girl and
find it work, yet be baffled in the case of a countess; or vice versa.
One might impose one’s Will on a farm, and be crushed by that of a city;
or vice versa. The Master Therion himself, with ail his successes in
every kind of Magick, sometimes appears utterly impotent to perform
feats which almost any amateur might do, because He has matched his Will
against that of the world, having undertaken the Work of a Magus to
establish the Word of is Law on the whole of mankind. He will succeed,
without doubt; but He hardly expects to see more than a sample of His
product during His présent incarnation. But He refuses to waste the
least fraction of His force on Works foreign to His Work, however
obvious it may seem to the onlooker that His advantage lies in
commanding stones to become bread, or otherwise making things easy for
Himself.</p>
<p>These considérations being thoroughly understood we may return to the
question of making the Magical Link. In the case above cited Frater
Perdurabo composed His talisman by invoking His Holy Guardian Angel
according to the Sacred Magick of Abramelin the Mage. That Angel wrote
on the lamen the Word of the Aeon. The Book of the Law is this writing.
To this lamen the Master Therion gave life by devoting His own life
thereto. We may then regard this talisman, the Law, as the most powerful
that has been made in the world’s history, for previous talismans of the
same type hâve been limited in their scope by conditions of race and
country. Mohammed’s talisman, Allah, was good only from Persia to the
Pillars of Hercules. The Buddha’s, Anatta, operated only in the South
and East of Asia. The new talisman, Thelema, is master of the
planet.</p>
<p>But now observe how the question of the Magical Link arises! No
matter how mighty the truth of Thelema, it cannot prevail unless it is
applied to and by mankind. As long as the Book of the Law was in
Manuscript, it could only affect the small group amongst whom it was
circulated. It had to be put into action bv</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>the Magical Operation of publishing it. When this was done, it was
done without proper perfection. Its commands as to how the work ought to
be done were not wholly obeyed. There were doubt and répugnance in
Frater Perdurabo^ mind, and they hampered His work. He was half-hearted.
Yet, even so, then intrinsic power of the truth of the Law and the
impact of the publication were sufficient to shake the world so that a
critical war broke out, and the minds of men were moved in a mysterious
manner. The second blow was struck by the re-publication of the Book in
September 1913, and this time the might of this Magick burst out and
caused a catastrophe to civilization. At this hour, the Master Therion
is concealed, collecting his forces for a final blow. When the Book of
the Law and its Comment is published, with the forces of His whole Will
in perfect obedience to the instructions which hâve up to now been
misunderstood or neglected, the resuit will be incalculably effective.
The event will establish the kingdom of the Crowned and Conquering Child
over the whole earth, and ail men shall bow to the Law, which is “love
under Will”.</p>
<p>This is an extreme case; but there is one law only to govern the
small as the great. The same laws describe and measure the motions of
the ant and the stars. Their light is no swifter than that of a spark.
In every operation of Magick the link must be properly made. The first
requisite is the acquisition of adéquate force of the kind required for
the purpose. We must hâve electricity of a certain potential in
sufficient amount if we wish to heat food in a furnace. We shall need a
more intense current and a greater supply to light a city than to charge
a téléphoné wire. No other kind of force will do. We cannot use the
force of steam directly to impel an aéroplane, or to get drunk. We must
apply it in adéquate strength in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>It is therefore absurd to invoke the spirit of Venus to procure us
the love of an Empress, unless we take measures to transmit the
influence of our work to the lady. We may for example consecrate a
letter expressing our Will; or, if we know how, we may use some object
connected with the person whose acts we are attempting to control, such
as a lock of hair or a handkerchief</p>
<p>once belonging to her, and so in subtle connection with her aura. But
for material ends it is better to hâve material means. We must not rely
on fine gut in trolling for salmon. Our wiil to kill a tiger is poorly
conveyed by a charge of small shot fired at a range of one hundred
yards. Our talisman must, therefore, be an object suitable to the nature
of our Operation, and we must hâve some such means of applying its force
to such a way as will naturally compel the obedience of the portion of
Nature which we are trying to change. If one will the death of a sinner,
it is not sufficient to hâte him, even if we grant that the vibrations
of thought, when sufficiently powerful and pure, may modify the Astral
light sufficiently to impress its intention to a certain extent on such
people as happen to be sensitive. It is much surer to use one’s mind and
muscle in service of that hâte by devising and making a dagger, and then
applying the dagger to the heart of one’s enemy. One must give one’s
hâte a bodily form of the same order as that which one’s enemy has taken
for his mani¬ festation. Your spirit can only corne into contact with
his by me^yis of this magical manufacture of phantomsj in the same way,
one can only measure one’s mind (a certain part of it) against another
man’s by expressing them in some such form as the game of chess. One
cannot use chessmen against another man unless he agréé to use them in
the same sense as you do. The board and men form the Magical Link by
which you can prove your power to constrain him to yield. The game is a
device by which you force him to turn down his king in surrender, a
muscular act made in obedience to your will, though he may be twice your
weight and strength.</p>
<p>These general principles should enable the student to understand the
nature of the work of making the Magical Link. It is impossible to give
detailed instructions, because every case demands separate
considération. It is sometimes exceedinglv difficult to devise proper
measures.</p>
<p>Remember that Magick includes ail acts soever. Anything may serve as
a Magical weapon. To impose one’s Will on a nation, for instance, one’s
talisman may be a newspaper, one’s triangle a church, or one’s circle a
Club. Tô win a woman, one’s</p>
<p>”4</p>
<p>pantacle may be a necklace} to discover a treasure, one’s wand may be
a dramatisas pen, or one’s incantation a popular song.</p>
<p>Many ends, many means: it is only important to remember the essence
of the operation, which is to will its success with suffi- ciently pure
intensity, and to incarnate that will in a body suitable to express it,
a body such that its impact on the bodily expression of the idea one
wills to change is to cause it to do so. For instance, is it my will to
become a famous physician? I banish ail “hostile spirits” such as
laziness, alien interests, and conflicting pleasures, from my “circle”
the hospital} J. consecrate my “weapons” (my various abilities) to the
study of medicine} I invoke the “Gods” (medical authorities) by studying
and obeying their laws in their books. I embody the “Formulae” (the ways
in which causes and effects influence disease) in a “Ritual” (my
Personal style of constraimng sickness to conform with my will). I
persist in these conjurations year after year, making the Magical
gestures of healing the sick, until I compel the visible appearance of
the Spirit of Time, and make him acknowledge me his master. I hâve used
the appropriate kind of means, in adéquate measure, and applied them in
ways pertinent to my purpose by projecting my incorporeal idea of
ambition in a course of action such as to induce in others the
incorporeal idea of satisfying mine. I made my Will manifest to sense}
sense swayed the Wills of my fellow- meii} mind wrought on mind through
matter.</p>
<p>I did not “sit for” a medical baronetcy by wishing I had it, or by an
“act of faith”, or by praying to God “to move Pharaoh’s heart”, as our
modem mental, or our mediaeval, mystic, miracle- mongers were and are
muddlers and maudlin enough to advise us to do.</p>
<p>A few general observations on the Magical Link may not be amiss, in
default of details} one cannot make a Manual of How to Go Courting, with
an Open-Sesame to each particular Brigand’s Cavern, any more than one
can furnish a budding burglar with a directory containing the
combination of every existing safe. But one can point out the broad
distinctions between women who yield, some to flattery, some to
éloquence, some to appearance, some to rank, some to wealth, some to
ardour, and some to authority. We</p>
<p>cannot exhaust the combinations of Lover’s Chess, but we may
enumerate the principal gambits: the Bouquet, the Chocolatés, the Little
Dinner, the Cheque-Book, the Poem, the Motor by Moonlight, the Marriage
Certificate, the Whip, and the Feigned Flight.</p>
<p>The Magical Link may be classified under three main heads; as it
involves (i) one plane and one person, (2) one plane and two or more
persons, (3) two planes.</p>
<p>In class (1) the machinery of Magick — the instrument — already
exists. Thus, I may wish to heal my own body, increase my own energy;
develop my own mental powers, or inspire my own imagination. Here the
Exorcist and the Démon are already connected, consciously or
subconsciously, by an excellent System of symbols. The Will is furnished
by Nature with an apparatus adequately equipped to convey and execute
its orders.</p>
<p>It is only necessary to inflame the Will to the proper pitch and to
issue its commands; they are instantly obeyed, unless — as in the case
of organic disease — the apparatus is damaged beyond the art of Nature
to repair. It may be necessary in such a case to assist the internai
“spirits” by the “purification” of medicines, the “banishing” of diet,
or some other extraneous means.</p>
<p>But at least there is no need of any spécial device ad hoc to effect
contact between the Circle and the Triangle. Operations of this class
are therefore often successful, even when the Magician has little or no
technical knowledge of Magick. Almost any duffer can “pull hinself
together”, devote himself to study, break off a bad habit, or conquer a
cowardice. This class of work, although the easiest, is yet the most
important ; for it includes initiation itself in its highest sense. It
extends to the Absolute in every dimension; it involves the most
intimate analysis, and the most comprehensive synthesis. In a sense, it
is the sole type of Magick either necessary or proper to the Adept; for
it includes both the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the
Holy Guardian Angel, and the Adventure of the Abyss.</p>
<p>The second class includes ail operations by which the Magician
strives to impose his Will upon objects outside his own control, but
within that of such other wills as are symbolised by means of</p>
<p>a System similar to his own. That is, they can be compelled naturally
by cognate consciousness.</p>
<p>For instance, one may wish to obtain the knowledge put forth in this
book. Not knowing that such a book exists, one might yet induce some one
who knows of it to offer a copy. Thus one’s operation would consist in
inflaming one’s Will to possess the knowledge to the point of devoting
one’s life to it, in expressing that will by seeking out people who seem
likely to know what is needed, and in imposing it on them by exhibiting
such enthusiastic earnestness that they will tell the enquirer that this
book will meet his needs.</p>
<p>Does this Sound too simple? Can this obvious common-sense course be
really that marvellous Magick that frightens folk so? Yes, even this
triviality is one instance of how Magick Works.</p>
<p>But the above practical programme may be a fiasco. One might then
resort to Magick in the conventional sense of the Word, by constructing
and charging a Pantacle appropriate to the object; this Pantacle should
then cause a strain in the Astral Light such that the vibrations would
compel some alien consciousness to restore equilibrium by bringing the
book.</p>
<p>Suppose a severer and more serious aim; suppose that I wish to win a
woman who dislikes me and loves somebody else. In this case, not only
her Will, but her lover’s must be overcome by my own. I hâve no direct
control of either. But my Will is in touch with the woman’s by means of
our minds; I hâve only to make my mind the master of hers by the
existing means of communication; her mind will then présent its
recantation to her Will, her Will repeal its decision, and her body
submit to mine as the seal of her surrender.</p>
<p>Here the Magical Link exists; only it is complex instead of simple as
in the First Class.</p>
<p>There is opportunity for ail kinds of error in the transmission of
the Will; misunderstanding may mar the matter; a mood may make mischief;
external events may interfère; the lover may match me in Magick; the
Operation itself may offend Nature in many ways; for instance, if there
is a subconscious incompatibility between myself and the woman, I
deceive myself into thinking</p>
<p>that I desire her. Such a flaw is enough to bring the whole operation
to naught, just as no effort of Will can make oil mix with water.</p>
<p>I may work “naturally” by wooing, of course. But, magically, I may
attack her astrally so that her aura becomes uneasy, respond- ing no
longer to her lover. Unless they diagnose the cause, a quarrel may
resuit, and the woman’s bewildered and hungry Body of Light may turn in
its distress to that of the Magician who has mastered it.</p>
<p>Take a third case of this class 2. I wish to recover my watch,
snatched from me in a crowd.</p>
<p>Here I hâve no direct means of control over the muscles that could
bring back my watch, nor over the mind that moves these muscles. I am
not even able to inform that mind of my Will, for I do not know where it
is. But I know it to be a mind fund- amentally like my own, and I try to
make a Magical Link with it by advertising my loss in the hope of
reaching it, being careful to calm it by promising it immunity, and to
appeal to its own known motive by offering a reward. I also attempt to
use the opposite formula j to reach it by sending my “familiar spirits”,
the police, to hunt it, and compel its obedience by threats. 1</p>
<p>Again, a sorcerer might happen to possess an object belonging
magicaily to a rich man, such as a compromising letter, which is really
as much part of him as his liver; he may then master the will of that
man by intimidating his mind. His power to publish the letter is as
effective as if he could injure the man’s body directly.</p>
<p>These “natural” cases may be transposed into subtler terms; for
instance, one might master another man, even a stranger, by sheer
concentration of will, ceremonially or otherwise wrought up to the
requisite potential. But in one way or another that will must be</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The cérémonial method would be to transfer to the watch — linked

the thief, and induce him to get rid of it at once. Observing
clairsentiently this effect, suggest relief and reward as the resuit of
restoring it.</li>
</ol>
<p>made to impinge on the manj by the normal means of contact if
possible, if not, by attacking some sensitive spot in his subconscious
sensonum. But the heaviest rod will not land the smallest fish unless
there be a line of some sort fixed firmly to both.</p>
<p>The Third Class is characterized by the absence of any existing link
between the Will of the Magician and that controlling the object to be
affected. (The Second Class may approximate to the 1 hird when there is
no possibility of approaching the second mind by normal means, as
sometimes happens).</p>
<p>This class of operations demands not only immense knowledge of the
technique of Magick combined with tremendous vigour and skill, but a
degree of IVIystical attainment which is exceedingly rare, and when
found is usually marked by an absolute apathy on the subject of any
attempt to achieve any Magick at ail. Suppose that I wish to produce a
thunderstorm. This event is beyond my control or that of any other manj
it is as useless to work on their minds as my own. Nature is independent
of, and indifferent to, man’s affairs. A storm is caused by atmospheric
conditions on a scale so enormous that the United efforts of ail us
Earth-vermin could scarcely disperse one cloud, even if we could get at
it. How then can any Magician, he who is above ail things a knower of
Nature, be so absurd as to attempt to throw the Hammer of Thor? Unless
he be simply insane, he must be initiated in a Truth which transcends
the apparent facts. He must be aware that ail Nature isa continuum, so
that his mind and body are consubstantial with the storm, are equally
expressions of One Existence, ail alike of the self-same order of
artifices whereby the Absolute appréciâtes itslf. He must also hâve
assimilated the fact that Quantity is just as much a form as Qualityj
that as ail things are modes of One Substance, so their measures are
modes of their relation. Not only are gold and lead mere letters,
meaningless in themselves yet appointed to spell the One Namej but the
différence between the bulk of a mountain and that of a mouse is no more
than one method of differentiating them, just as the letter “m” is not
bigger that the letter “i” in any real sense of the word. 1</p>
<p>I. Professor Rutherford thinks it not theoretically impracticable
to</p>
<p>Our Magician, with this in his minci, will most probably leave
thunderstorms to stew in their own juice; but, should he décidé (after
ail) to enliven the afternoon, he will work in the manner following.</p>
<p>First, what are the éléments necessary for his storms ? He .must hâve
certain stores of electrical force, and the right kind of clouds to
contain it.</p>
<p>He must see that the force does not leak away to earth quietly and
slyly.</p>
<p>He must arrange a stress so severe as to become at last so intolér¬
able that it will disrupt explosively.</p>
<p>Now he, as a man, cannot pray to God to cause them, for the Gods are
but names for the forces of Nature themselves*</p>
<p>But, as a Mystic , he knows that ail things are phantoms of One
Thing, and that they may be withdrawn therein to reissue in other
attire. He knows that ail things are in himself, and that he is All-One
with the Ail. There is therefore no theoretical difficulty about
converting the illusion of a clear sky into that of a tempest. On the
other hand, he is aware, as a Magician y that illusions are governed by
the laws of their nature. He knows that twice two is four, although both
“two” and “four” are merely properties per- taining to One. He can only
use the Mystical identity of ail things in a strictly scientific sense.
It is true that his expérience of clear skies and storms proves that his
nature contains éléments cognate with both; for if not, they could not
affect him. He is the Microcosm of his own Macrocosm, whether or no
either one or the other extend beyond his knowledge of them. He must
there¬ fore arouse in himself those ideas which are clansmen of the
Thunderstorm ; collect ail available objects of the same nature for
talismans, and proceed to excite ail these to the utmost by a Magical
ceremony; that is, by insisting on their godhead, so that they
flamewithin and without him, his ideas vitalising the talismans. There
is thus a vivid vibration of high potential in a certain group</p>
<p>construct a detonator which could destroy every atom of matter by
releasing the energies of one, so that the vibrations would excite the
rest to disintegrate explosively.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>of sympathetic substances and forces ; and this spreads as do the
waves from a stone thrown into a lake, widening and weakeningj till the
disturbance is compensated. Just as a handful of fanatics, insane with
one over-emphasised truth, may infect a whole country for a time bv
inflaming that thought in their neighbours, so the Magician créâtes a
commotion by disturbing the balance of power. He transmits his
particular vibration as a radio operator does with his ray 5
rate-relation détermines exclusive sélection.</p>
<p>In practice, the Magician must a evoke the spirits of the storm” by
identifying himself with the ideasof which atmospheric phenom- ena are
the expressions as his humanity is of him; this achieved, he must impose
his Will upon them by virtue of the superiority of his intelligence and
the intégration of his purpose to their undirected impulses and
uncomprehending interplay.</p>
<p>Ail such. Magick demands the utmost précision in practice. It is true
that the best rituals give us instructions in selecting our vehicles of
Force. In 777 we find “correspondences” of many classes of being with
the various types of operation, so that we know what weapons, jewels,
figures, drugs, perfurnes, names, etc. to employ in any particular work.
But it has always been assumed that the invoked force is intelligent and
competent, that it will direct itself as desired without further ado, by
this method of sympathetic vibrations.</p>
<p>The necessity of timing the force has been ignored; and so most
operations, even when well performed as far as invocation goes, are as
harmless as igniting loose gunpowder.</p>
<p>But, even allowing that Will is sufficient to détermine the direc¬
tion, and prevent the dispersion, of the force, we can hardly be sure
that it will act on its object, unless that object be properly prepared
to receive it. The Link must be perfectly made. The object must possess
in itself a sufficiency of stuff sympathetic to our work. We cannot make
love to a brick, or set an oak to run errands.</p>
<p>We see, then, that we can never affect anything outside ourselves
save only as it is also within us. Whatever I do to another, I do also
to myself. If I kill a man, I destroy my own life at the same time. That
is the magical meaning of the so-</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>called “Golden Rule”, which should not be in the impérative but the
indicative mood. Every vibration awakens ail others o£ its par- ticular
pitch.</p>
<p>There is thus some justification for the assumption of previous
writers on Magick that the Link is implicit, and needs no spécial
attention. Yet, in practice, there is nothing more certain than that one
ought to confirm one’s will by ail possible acts on ail possible planes.
The ceremony must not be confined to the formally magical rites. We must
neglect no means to our end, neither despising our common sense, nor
doubting our secret wisdom.</p>
<p>When Frater I. A. was in danger of death in 1899 e.v. Frater V. N.
and Frater Perdurabo did indeed invoke the spirit Buer to visible
manifestation that he might heal their brother; but also one of them
furnished the money to send him to a climate less cruel than England’s.
He is alive to day 1 } who cares whether spirits or shekels wrought that
which these Magicians willed ?</p>
<p>Let the Magical Link be made strong! It is “love under will”; it
affirms the identity of the Equation of the work; it makes success
Necessity.</p>
<p>I. P. S. He died some months after this passage was written : but he
had been enabled to live and work for nearly a quarter of a century
longer than he would otherwise hâve done.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>
<p>(Part /)</p>
<p>Of THE OATH</p>
<p>The third operation in any magical ceremony is the oath or
proclamation. The Magician, armed and ready, stands in the centre of the
Circle, and strikes once upon the bell as if to call the attention of
the Umverse. Ele then déclarés who he is y reciting his magical history
by the proclamation of the grades which he has attained, giving the
signs and words of those grades. 1</p>
<p>He then States tlie purpose of tlie ceremony, and proves tliat it is
necessary to perform it and to sncceed in its performance. He then takes
an oath before the Lord of the Universe (not before the particular Lord
whom he is invoking) as if to call Him to witness to the act. He swears
solemnly that he will perform it — that nothing shall prevent him from
performing it — that he will not leave the operation until it is
successfully performed — and once again he strikes upon the bell.</p>
<p>Yet, having demonstrated himself in that position at once infinitely
lofty and infinitely unimportant, the instrument of destiny, he balances
this by the Confessïon y in which there is again an infinité exaltation
harmonised with an infinité humility. He admits himself to be a weak
human being humbly aspiring to something higher; a créature of
circumstance utterly dépendent — even for the breath of life — upon a
sériés of fortunate accidents.</p>
<p>I. This is not merely to prove himself a person in authority. It is
to trace the chain of causes that hâve led to the présent position, so
that the operation is seen as karma.</p>
<p>123 —</p>
<p>He makes this confession prostrate J before the altar in agony and
bloody sweat. He trembles at the thought of the operation which he has
dared to undertake, saying, “Father, if it be Thy Will, let this cup
pass from me ! Nevertheless not my will but Thine be done !” 1 2</p>
<p>The dread answer cornes that It Must Be, and this answer so fortifies
him with holy zeal that it will seem to him as if he were raised by
divine hands from that prostrate position; with a thrill of holy
exaltation he renews joyfully the Oath, feeling himself once again no
longer the man but the Magician, yet not merely the Magician, but the
chosen and appointed person to accomplish a task which, however
apparently unimportant, is yet an intégral part of universal destiny, so
that if it were not accomplished the Kingdom of Heaven would be burst in
pièces.</p>
<p>He is now ready to commence the invocations. He consequently pauses
to cast a last glance around the Temple to assure himself of the perfect
readiness of ail things necessary, and to light the incense.</p>
<p>The Oath is the foundation of ail Work in Magick, as it is an
affirmation of the Will. An Oath binds the Magician for ever. In Part II
of Book 4 something has already been said on this subject; but its
importance deserves some further élaboration. Thus, should one, loving a
woman, make a spell to compel her embraces, and tiring of her a little
later, evoke Zazel to kill her; he will find that the implications of
his former Oath conflict with those proper to invoke the Unity of the
Godhead of Saturn. Zazel will refuse to obey him in the case of the
woman whom he has sworn that he loves. To this some may object that,
since ail acts are magical, every man who loves a woman implicitly takes
an</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Compare the remarks in a previous chapter. But this is a
particular case. We leave its justification as a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course this is for the beginner. As soon as it is assimilated
as true, he will say : “My will which is thine be done !” And ultimately
no more distinguish “mine” from “thine”. A sympathetic change of gesture
will accompany the mental change.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>124</p>
<p>Oath of love, and therefore would never be able to murder her later,
as we find to be the not uncommon case. The explanation is as follows.
It is perfectly true that when Bill Sykes desires to possess Nancy, he
does in fact evoke a spirit of the nature of Venus, constraining him by
his Oath of Love (and by his magical power as a man) to bring him the
girl. So also, when he wants to kiJl her, he evokes a Martial or
Saturnian spirit, with an Oath of hâte. But these are not pure planetary
spints, moving in well- dehned spneres by rigidlv righteous laws. They
are gross concré¬ tions of confused impulses, “incapable of
understanding the nature of an oath”. They are also such that the idea
of murder is nowise offensive to the Spirit of Love.</p>
<p>It is indeed the cntenon of spiritual caste that conflicting éléments
should not coexist in the same consciousness. The psalm- singing Puritan
who persécutes publicans, and secretly soaks himself in hre-water; the
bewhiskered philanthropist in broad- cloth who swindles his customers
and sweats his employées: these men must not be regarded as
single-minded scoundrels, whose use of religion and respectability to
cioke their villainies is a deliberate disguise dictated by their
criminal cunning. Far from it, they are only too sincere in their
“virtues”; their terror of death and of supernatural vengeance is
genuine; it proceeds from a section of themselves which is in
irreconcilable conflict with their rascality. Neither si de can
conciliate, suppress, or ignore the other; yet each is so craven as to
endure its enemy’s presence. Such men are therefore without pure
principles; they excuse themselves for every dirty trick that turns to
their apparent advantage.</p>
<p>The first step of the Aspirant toward the Gâte of Initiation tells
him that purity — unity of purpose — is essential above ail else. “Do
what thou Wilt” strikes on him, a ray of berce white flame consuming ail
that is not utterly God. Very soon he is aware that he cannot
consciously contradict himself. He develops a subtle sense which warns
him that two trains of thought which he had never conceived as connected
are incompatible. Yet deeper drives “Do what thou wiit”$ subconscious
oppositions are evoked to visible appearance. The secret sanctuaries of
the soûl are cleansed. “Do What thou Wilt” purges his every part. He has
become One, one only. His Will is consequently released from</p>
<p>125 —</p>
<p>ihe interférence of internai opposition, and he is a Master of
Magick. But for that very reason he is now utterly impotent to achieve
anything that is not in absolute accordance with his Original Oath, with
his True Will, by virtue whereof he incarnated as a man. With Bill Sykes
love and murder are not mutually exclusive, as they are with King
Arthur. The higher the type of man, the more sensitive he becomes; so
that the noblest love divines intuitively when a careless word or
gesture may wound, and, vigilant, shuns them as being of the family of
murder. In Magick, likewise, the Adept who is sworn to attain to the
Know¬ ledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel may in his
grosser days hâve been expert as a Healer, to find that he is now
incapable of any such work. He will probably be puzzled, and wonder
whether he has lost ail his power. Y et the cause may be no more than
that the Wisdom of his Angel deprecates the interférence of ignorant
kindlmess with diseases which may hâve been sent to the sufferer for a
purpose profoundly important to his welfare.</p>
<p>In the case af The Master Therion, he h ad originally the capacity
for ail classes of Orgia. In the beginnmg, He cured the sick, bewitched
the obstinate, allured the seductive, routed the aggressive, made
himself invisible, and generaliy behaved like a Young-Man-About-Town on
every possible plane. He would afflict one vampire with a Sending of
Cats, and appoint another his private Enchantress, neither aware of any
moral oxymoron, nor hampered by the implicit incongruity of his
oaths.</p>
<p>But as He advanced in Adeptship, this coltishness found its mouth
bittedj as soon as He took serious Oaths and was admitted to the Order
which we name not, those Oaths prevented him using His powers as
playthings. Trifling operations, such as He once could do with a turn of
the wrist, became impossible to the most persistent endeavour. It was
many years before He understood the cause of this. But little by little
He became so absorbed in the Work of His true Will that it no longer
occurred to Him to indulge in capricious amusements.</p>
<p>Yet even at this hour, though He be verily a Magus of A.  A.*.,
though His Word be the Word of the Aeon, though He be the Beast 666, the
Lord of the Scarlet Woman “in whom is ail power</p>
<p>— 126 —</p>
<p>given”, there are still certain Orgia beyond Him to perform, oecause
to do so would be to affirm what He hath denied in those Oaths by whose
virtue He is Ihat He is. This is the case, even when the spirit of such
Orgia is fully consonant with His Will.</p>
<p>Ihe literal sense of His original Oath insists that it shall be
respected.</p>
<p>The case offers two instances of this principle. Frater Perdurabo
specifically swore that He would renounce His Personal possessions to
the last penny5 also that He would allow no human affection to hinder
Elim. Ihese ternis were accepted; He was granted infinitely more than He
had imagined possible to any incarnated Man. On the other hand, the
price offered by Him was exacted as stnctly as if it had been stipulated
by Shylock. Kvery tieasure that he had on earth was taken away, and
that, usually, 111 so biutal 01 ciuel a manner as to make the loss
îtself the least part of the pang. Every human affection that He had in
His hea.it and that heart aches for Love as few hearts can ever conceive
was torn out and trampled with such infernal ingenuity in intensifying
torture that His endurance is beyond belief. Inexplicable are the
atrocities which accompanied every step in His Initiation! Death dragged
away His children with slow savagery; the women He loved drank
themselves into delirium and dementia before His eyes, or repaie! His
passionate dévotion with toad-cold treachery at the moment when long
years of loyalty had tempted Him to trust them. His friend, that bore
the bag, stole that which was put therein, and betrayed his Master as
thoroughly as he was able. At the first distant rumour that the
Pharisees were out, his disciples “ail forsook Him and fled”. Elis
mother nailed Him with lier own hands to the cross, and reviled Him as
nine years He hung thereupon.</p>
<p>Now, having endured to the end, being Master of Magick, He is mighty
to Work His true Will- which Will is, to establish on Earth His Word,
the Law of Thelema. He hath none other Will than this j so ail that He
doth is unto this end. Ail His Orgia bear fruit; what was the work of a
month when He was a full Major Adept is to day wrought in a few minutes
by the Words of Will, uttered with the right vibrations into the
prepared Ear.</p>
<p>— 127 —</p>
<p>But neither by the natural use of His abilities, though they hâve
made Him famous through the whole world, nor by the utmost rnight of his
Magick, is He able to acquire material wealth beyond the minimum
necessary to keep Him alive and at work. It is in vain that He protests
that not He but the Work is in need of money ; He is barred by the
strict Jetter of His Oath to give ail that He hath for His magical
Attainment.</p>
<p>Yet more awful is the doom that He hath invoked upon Himself in
renouncing His right as a man to enjoy the Love of those whom He loves
with passion so selfless, so pure, and so intense in return for the
power so to love Mankind that He be chosen to utter the Word of the Aeon
for their sake, His reward universal abhorrence, bodily torment, mental
despair, and moral paralysis.</p>
<p>Yet He, who hath power over Death, with a breath to call back health,
with a touch to beckon life, He must watch His own child waste awav
month by month, aware that His Art may not anywise avail, who hath sold
the signet ring of his personal profit to buy him a plain gold band for
the félon finger of his bride, that worn widow, the World!</p>
<p>128 —</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Of the Invocation</p>
<p>In the straightforward or “Protestant** System of Magick there is
very little to add to what has already been said. The Magician addresses
a direct pétition to the Being invoked. But the secret of success in
invocation has not hitherto been disclosed. It is an exceedingly simple
one. It is practically of no importance whatever that the invocation
should be “right”. There are a thousand different wavs of compassing the
end proposed, so far as external things are concerned. The whole secret
may be summarised in these four words: “Enflame thyself in praying.”
1</p>
<p>The mind must be exalted until it loses consciousness of self. The
Magician must be carried forward blindly by a force which, though. in
him and of him, is by no means that which he in his normal State of
consciousness calls I. Just as the poet, the lover, the artist, is
carried out of himself in a Creative frenzy, so must it be for the
Magician.</p>
<p>It is impossible to lay down rules for the obtaining of this spécial
stimulus. To one the mystery of the whole ceremony may appeal; another
may be moved by the strangeness of the words, even by the fact that the
“barbarous names” are unintelligible to him. Some- times in the course
of a ceremony the true meaning of some barbarous name that has hitherto
baffled his analysis may flash upon him, luminous and splendid, so that
he is caught up into</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>This is Qabalistically expressed in the old Formula : Domine noster,
audi tuo servo! kyrie Christel O Christel</li>
</ol>
<p>129</p>
<p>orgasm. The smell o£ a particular incense may excite him effec-
tively, or perhaps the physical ecstasy of the magick dance.</p>
<p>Every Magician must compose liis ceremony in siieh a manner as to
produce a drasnatic climax. At the moment when the excitement hecomes
ungovernable, when the whole conscious being of the Magician undergoes a
spiritual spasm, at thaï moment must lie utter the suprême
adjuration.</p>
<p>One veiy effective method is to stop short, by a suprême effort of
will, again and again, on the very brink of that spasm, until a time
arrives when the idea of exercising that will fails to occur  
Inhibition is no longer possible or even thinkable, and the whole heing
of the Magician, no minutes! atom saying nay, is irresistibly fJung
forth. In blinding light, amid the roar of ten thousand thunders, the
Union of God and man is consummated.</p>
<p>If the Magician is stiJl seen standing in the Circle, quietly
pursuing his invocations, it is that ail the conscious part of him has
become detached from the true ego which lies behind that normal
consciousness. But the circle is wholly filled with that divine essence
3 ail else is but an accident and an illusion.</p>
<p>The subséquent invocations, the graduai development and
materialization of the force, require no effort. It is one great mistake
of the beginner to concentrate his force upon the actual stated purpose
of the ceremony. This mistake is the most frequent cause of failures in
invocation.</p>
<p>A coroliary of this Theorem is that the Magician soon discards
évocation almost altogether — only rare circumstances demand any action
what ever on the material plane. The Magician devotes himself entirely
to the invocation of a god 3 and as soon as his balance approaches
perfection he ceases to invoke any partial god 3 only that god
vertically above him is in his path. And so a man who perhaps took up
Magick merely with the idea of acquiring knowledge, love, or wealth,
finds himself irrevocably committed to the performance of The Great
Work.</p>
<p>I. This forgetfulness must be complété; it is fatal to try to Tet
oneself go’ consciously.</p>
<p>— 130 —</p>
<p>It wiJl now be apparent that there is no distinction between magick
and méditation except of the most arbitrary and accidentai kind. 1</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Beside these open methods there are also a number of mental methods
of Invocation, of which we may give three.</p>
<p>The first method concerns the so-called astral body. The Magician
should practise the formation of this body as recom- mended in Liber O,
and learn to rise on the planes according to the instruction given in
the same book, though limiting his a rising” to the particular Symbol
whose God he wishes to invoke.</p>
<p>The second is to recite a mantra suitable to the God.</p>
<p>The third is the assumption of the form of the God — by transmuting
the astral body into LIis shape. This last method îs really essential to
ail proper invocation, and cannot be too sedulously practised.</p>
<p>There are many other devices to aid invocation, so many that it is
impossible to enumerate them; and the Magician will be wise to busy
himself in inventing new ones.</p>
<p>We will give one example.</p>
<p>Suppose the Suprême Invocation to consist of 20 or 30 barbarous
liâmes, let hirn imagine these liâmes to occupy sections of a vertical
column, each double the length of the preceding one 5 and let him
imagine that his consciousness ascends the column with each name, The
mere multiplication will then produce a feeling of awe and bewilderment
which is the proper forerunner of ecstasy.</p>
<p>I11 the essay “Energized Enthusiasm” in No. IX, Vol. 1 of the Equinox
2 is given a concise account of one of the classical methods of arousing
Kundalini. This essay should be studied with care and détermination.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is the general metaphysical antithesis that Magick is the
Art of the Will-to-Live, Mysticism of the Will-to-Die; but—“Truth cornes
bubbling to my brim; Life and Death are one to Him!”.</p></li>
<li><p>The earliest and truest Christians used what is in ail essentials
this method. See “Fragments of a Faith Forgotten” by G. R. S. Mead, Esa.
B. A., pp. 80-81.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a real connexion between what the vulgar call blasphemy
and</p>
<p>131 —</p>
<p>what they call immorality, in the fact that the Christian îegend is
an écho of a Phallic rite. There is also a true and positive connexion
between the Creative force of the Macrocosm, and that of the Microcosm.
For this reason the latter must be made as pure and consecrated as the
former. The puzzle for most people is how to do this. The study of
Nature is the Key to that Gâte.</p>
<p>132 —</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>
<p>(Part II)</p>
<p>Of THE CHARGE TO THE SPIRIT WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTRAINTS AND
CURSES OCCASIONALLY NECESSARY</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>On the appearance of the spirit, or the manifestation of the force in
the talisman which is being consecrated, it is necessary to bind it by
an Oath or Charge. A spirit should be made to lay its hand visibly on
the weapon by whose might it has been evoked, and to a swear obedience
and faith to Him that liveth and triumpheth, that reigneth above him in
His palaces as the Balance of Righteousness and Truth” by the Names used
in that évocation.</p>
<p>It is then only necessary to formulate the Oath or Charge in language
harmonious with the previously announced purpose of the operation.</p>
<p>Tlie précaution indicated is not to let oneself sink into one’s
humanity while the weapon is extended beyond the Circle. Were the force
to flow from it to you instead of from you to it, you would be
infallibly blasîed, or, ai the least, become the slave of the
spirit.</p>
<p>At no moment is it more important that the Divine Force should not
only fill, but radiate from, the aura of the Magician.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Occasionally it may happen that the spirit is récalcitrant, and
refuses to appear.</p>
<p>Let the Magician consider the cause of such disobedience!</p>
<p>— 133 “</p>
<p>It may be that tiie place or time is wrong. One cannot easily evoke
water-spirits in the Sahara, or salamanders in the English Lake
District. Hismael will not readily appear when Jupiter is below the
horizon. 1 2 In order to counteract a natural deficiency of this sort,
one would hâve to supply a sufficient quantity of the proper kind of
material. One cannot make bricks without straw.</p>
<p>With regard to invocations of the Gods, such considérations do not
apply. The Gods are beyond most material conditions. It is necessarv to
hll the heart and mïnd with the proper basis for manuestauon. The higher
the nature of the God, the more true tins is. The Holy Guardian Angel
has always the necessary hasis. His manifestation dépends solely on the
readiness oî tue Aspirant, and ail magical ceremonies used in that
invocation are merely intended to préparé that Aspirant; not in any way
to attract or influence Him. It is His constant and et ornai “W ill to
hecome one with the Aspirant, and the moment the coiiditions of the
lutter muke it possible, That Bridai is consummaled.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The obstinacy of a spirit (or the inertia of a talisman) usually
implies a defect in invocation. The spirit cannot resist even for a
moment the constraint of his Intelligence, when that Intelligence is
working in accordance with the Will of the Angel, Archangel</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is not possible in this elementary treatise to explain the
exact nature of the connexion between the rays of the actual planet
called Jupiter and the Jupiterian éléments which exist in varions
degrees in terrestrial objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Since this Knowledge and Conversation is not universal, it seems
at first as if an omnipotent will were being baulked. But His Will and
your will together make up that one will, because you and He are one.
That one will is therefore divided against itself, so long as your will
fails to aspire steadfastly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Also, His will cannot constrain yours. He is so much one with you
that even your will to separate is His will. He is so certain of you
that He delights in your perturbation and coquetry no less than in your
surrender. These relations are fully explained in Liber LXV. See also
Liber Aleph CXI.</p>
<p>~ 134 —</p>
<p>and God above him. It is therefore better to repeat the Invo¬ cations
than to proceed at once to curses.</p>
<p>The Magician should also consider 1 whether die évoca¬ tion be in
trnth a necessary part of the Karma of the Universe, as he has stated in
his own Oath (See Cap. XVI. i), For if this be a delusion, success is
impossible. It will then be best to go back to the beginning, and
recapitulate with greater intensity and power of analysis the Oath and
the Invocations. And this may be done thrice.</p>
<p>But if this be satisfactorily accomplished, and the spirit be y et
disobedient, the implication is thaï sonie hostile force is at work îo
hinder the operation. It will then become advisable to discover the
nature of that force, and to attack and desîroy it. This makes the
ceremony more useful than ever to the Magician, who may thereby be led
to irnveil a black magical gang whose existence he had not hitherto
snspected.</p>
<p>His need to check the vampiring of a lady in Paris by a sorceress
once led Frater Perdurabo to the discovery of a very powerful body of
black magicians, with whom he was obliged to war for nearly îo years
before their ruin was complété and irrémédiable as it now is.</p>
<p>Such a discovery will not necessarily impede the ceremony. A general
curse may be pronounced against the forces hindering the operation (for
ex hyfothesi no divine force can be interfering) and having thus
temporarily dislodged them — for the power of the God invoked will
suffire for this purpose — one may proceed with a certain asperity to
conjure the spirit, for that he has done ill to bend before the
conjurations of the Black Brothers.</p>
<p>Indeed, some démons are of a nature such that they only understand
curses, are not amenable to courteous command:—</p>
<p>“a slave</p>
<p>Whom stripes may move, not kindness.”</p>
<p>Finally, as a last resource, one may burn the Sigil of the</p>
<p>I. Of course this should hâve been done in preparing the Ritual. But
he renews this considération from the new standpoint attained by the
invocation.</p>
<p>H5 —</p>
<p>Spirit in a black box wiîh stinking substances, alï îiaving been
properly prepared beforehand, and tlie magical links properîy made, so
that lie is really tortured by the Operation. 1</p>
<p>This is a rare event, however. Only once in the whole of his magical
career was Frater Perurabo driven to so harsh a measure.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>In this connexion, beware of too ready a compliance on the part of
the spirit. If some Black Lodge has got wind of your operation, it may
send the spirit, full of hypocritical submission, to destroy you. Such a
spirit will probably pronounce the oath amiss, or in some way seek to
avoid his obligations.</p>
<p>It is a dangerous trick, though, for the Black Lodge to play; tor if
the spirit corne properly under your control, it will be forced to
disclose the transaction, and the current will return to the Black Lodge
with fulminating force. The liars will be in the power of their own lie;
their own slaves will rise up and put them into</p>
<p>bondage. The wicked fall into the pit that they themseives
digged.</p>
<p>And so perish ail the King’s enemies!</p>

<p>The charge to the spirit is usually embodied, except in Works of pure
évocation, which after ali are comparatively rare, in sonie kind of
talisman. In a certain sense, the talisman is the Charge expressed in
hieroglyphics. Yet, every object soever is a talisman, for the
définition of a talisman is: something upon which an act of will (that
is, of Magick) has been performed in order to fit it for a purpose.
Repeated acts of will in respect of</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The précisé meaning of these phrases is at first sight obscure. The
spirit is merely a récalcitrant part of one’s own organism. To evoke him
is therefore to become conscious of some part of one’s own character; to
command and constrain him is to bring that part into subjection. This is
best understood by the analogy of teaching oneself some mental-physical
accomplishment (e. g. billiards), by persistent and patient study and
practice, which often involves considérable pain as well as
trouble.</li>
</ol>
<p>1 3 6 —</p>
<p>any object consecrate it without further ado. One knows what miracles
can be clone with one’s favourite mashie! One has used the mashie again
and again, one’s love for it growing in proportion to one’s success with
it, and that success again made more certain and complété by the effect
of this “love under will”, which one bestows upon it by using it.</p>
<p>It is, of course, very important to keep such an object away from the
contact of the profane. It is instinctive not to let another person use
one’s fishing rod or one’s gun. It is not that they could do any harm in
a material sense. It is the feeling that one’s use of these things has
consecrated them to one’s self.</p>
<p>Of course, the outstanding example of ail such talismans is the wife.
A wife may be defined as an object specially prepared for taking the
stamp of one’s Creative will. This is an example of a very complicated
magical operation, extending over centuries. But, theoretically, it is
just an ordinary case of talismanic magick. It is for this reason that
so much trouble has been taken to prevent a wife having contact with the
profane; or, at least, to try to prevent her.</p>
<p>Readers of the Bible will remember that Absalom publicly adopted
David’s wives and concubines on the roof of the palace, in order to
signify that he had succeeded in breaking his father’s magical
power.</p>
<p>Now, there are a great many talismans in this world which are being
left lying about in a most reprehensibly careless manner. Such are the
objects of popular adoration, as ikons and idols. But, it is actually
true that a great deal of real magical Force is locked up in such
things; consequently, by destroying these sacred symbols, you can
overcome magically the people who adore them.</p>
<p>It is not at ail irrational to fight for one’s flag, provided that
the flag is an object which really means something to somebody.
Similarly, with the most widely spread and most devotedly worshipped
talisman of ail, money, you can evidently break the magical will of a
worshipper of money by taking his money away from him, or by destroying
its value in some way or another. But, in the case of money, general
expérience tells us that there is very little of it lying about loose.
In this case, above ali,</p>
<p>137 “</p>
<p>people hâve recognised its talismanic virtue, that is to say, its
power as an instrument of the wilL</p>
<p>But with many ikons and images, it is easy to steai their virtue.
This can be done sometimes on a tremendous scale, as, for example, when
ail the images of Isis and Horus, or similar mother-child combinations,
were appropriated Wholesale by the Christians. The miracle is, however,
of a somewhat dangerous type, as in this case, where enlightenment has
corne through the researches of archaeologists. It has been shown that
the so-called images of Mary and Jésus are really nothing but imitations
of those of Isis and tiorus. Honesty is the best policy in Magick as in
other lines of life.</p>
<p>138 —</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII</p>
<p>Of THE LICENSE TO DEPART</p>
<p>After a ceremony has reached its climax, anti-climax must inevitably
follow. But if the ceremony has been successful this anti-climax is
merely formai. The Magician should rest permanently on the higher plane
to which he has aspired. 1 The whole force of the operation should be
ahsorhed; but there is almost certain to be a residuum, since no
operation is perfect; and (even if it were sol there would be a number
of things, sympathetic to the operation, attracted to the Circle. These
must be duly dispersed, or thev will degenerate and become evil. It is
always easy to do this where invocations are concerned; the mere removal
of the strain imposed by the will of the magician will restore things to
their normal aspects, in accordance with the great law of inertia. In a
badly-managed évocation, however, this does not always obtainj the
spirit may refuse to be controlled, and may refuse to départ — even
after having sworn obedience. In such a case extreme danger may
arise.</p>
<p>In the ordinary way, the Magician dismisses the spirit with these
words: “And now I say unto thee, départ in peace unto thine habitations
and abodes — and may the blessing of the Highest be upon thee in the
name of (here mention the divine name suitable to the operation, or a
Name appropriate to redeem that spirit) 3 and let there be peace between
thee and me 3 and be thou very ready to corne, whensoever thou art
invoked and called!” 1 2</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The rock-climber who relaxes on the face of the précipice falls

<p>Should lie fai! to disappear immediately, it is a sign thaï there is
something ver y wrong, The Magician should immediaîely reconsecrate the
Circle with the uîmost care. He should then repeat the dismissal; and if
this does not suffice, he should then perform the banishing ritual
suitable to the nature of the spirit and, if necessary, add conjurations
to the same effect. In these circumstances, or if anything else
suspicious should occur, he should not be content with the apparent
disappearance of the spirit, who might easily make himself invisible and
lie in ambush to do the Magician a mischief when he stepped out of the
Circle — or even months afterwards.</p>
<p>An y symhol whieh lias once definitely entered your environment with
your own consent is extremely danger ous; unless under absolut e c ont
roi, A man’s friends are more capable of working him harm than are
strangers; and his greatest danger lies in his own habits.</p>
<p>Of course it is the very condition of progress to build up ideas into
the subconscious. The necessity of sélection should therefore be
obvious.</p>
<p>True, there cornes a time when ail éléments soever must be thus
assimilated. Samadhi is, by définition, that very process. But, from the
point of view of the young magician, there is a right wav — strait and
difficult •— of performing ail this. One cannot too frequently repeat
that what is lawful and proper to one Path is alien to another.</p>
<p>Immediately after the License to Départ, and the general closing up
of the work,it is necessary that the Magician should sit down and write
up his magical record. However much he may hâve been tired 1 by the
ceremony, he ought to force himself to do this until it becomes a habit.
Verily, it is better to fail in the magical ceremony than to fail in
writing down an accurate record of it. One need not doubt the propriety
of this remark. Even if one is eaten alive by Malkah be-Tarshishim
ve-Ruachoth ha-Schehalim, it does not matter very much, for it is over
so very quickly. But the record of the transaction is</p>
<p>I. He ought to be refreshed, more than after a full night’s deep
sleep. This forms one test of his skill.</p>
<p>— 140 —</p>
<p>otherwise important. Nobody cares about Duncan having been murdered
by Macbeth. It is only one of a number of similar murders. But
Shakespeare’s account of the incident is a unique treasure of mankind.
And, apart from the question of the value to others, there is that of
the value to the magician himself. The record of the magician is his
best asset.</p>
<p>It is as foolish to do Magick without method, as if it were anything
else. To do Magick without keeping a record is like tiying to run a
business without book-keeping. There are a great manv people who quite
misunderstand the nature of Magick. They hâve an idea that it is
something vague and unreal, instead ot being, as it is, a direct means
of coming into contact with reauty. It is these people who pay
themselves with phrases, who are always using long words with no
definite connotation, who p aster themselves with pompous titles and
décorations which mean nothing whatever. With such people we hâve
nothing to do But to those who seek reality the Key of Magick is
offered, and they are hereby warned that the key to the treasure-house
is</p>
<p>no good without the combination; and the combination is the magical
record.</p>
<p>From one point of view, magical progress actually con- sists in
deciphering one’s own record. 1 For this reason it is the most important
thing to do, on strictly magical grounds. But apart from this, it is
absolutely essential that the record snould be clear, fu.ll and concise,
because it is only by such a record that your teacher can judge how it
is best to help you. Your magical teacher has something else to do
besides running around .er you ail the time, and.the most important of
ail his functions is that of auditor. Now, if you call in an auditor to
investigate a business, and when he asks for the books you tell him that
you hâve not thought it worth while to keep any, you need not be
surprised if he thinks you every kind of an ass.</p>
<p>It is at least, it was — perfectly incredible to The Master Th er ion
that people who exhibit ordinary common sense in</p>
<p>• 1 ne 1S a ^ tai * in t ^ e Bod y ^uith, every successive
incarnation</p>
<p>is a Veil, and the acquisition of the Magical Memory a graduai
UnveilinP- of that Star, of that God. 6</p>
<p>the other affairs of life should lose it completely when they tackle
Magick. It goes far to justify the helief of the semi- educated that
Magick is rather a crazy affair after ail. However, there are none of
these half-baked lunatics connected with the A.*. A.’., because the
necessity for hard work, for passing examinations at stated intervals,
and for keeping an intelligible account of what they are doing,
frightens away the unintelligent, idle and hysterical.</p>
<p>There are numerous models of magical and mystical records to be found
in the various numbers of the Equinox y and the student will hâve no
difficulty in acquiring the necessary technique, if he be diligent in
practice.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII</p>
<p>Of CLAIRVOYANCE AND OF THE BODY OF LIGHT Il’S POWER AND ITS
DEVELOPMENT A.LSO CONCERNING DIVINATION</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Within ilie liuman body is another body of approximately the same
size and sliape; L but made of a subîler and less iilnsory materiaL It
is of course not “real” 5 but then no more is the other body! Before
treating of clairvoyance one must discuss briefly this question of
reality, for misapprehension on the subject has given rise to endless
trouble.</p>
<p>There is the story of the American in the train who saw another
American carrying a basket of unusual shape. His curiosity mastered him,
and he leant across and said: “Say, stranger, what you got in that bag
?” The other, lantern-jawed and taciturn, replied : “Mongoose”. The hrst
man was rather baffled, as he had never heard of a mongoose. After a
pause he pursued, at the risk of a rebuff : “But say, what is a Mongoose
?” “Mongoose eats snakes”, replied the other. This was another poser,
but he pursued; “What in he.ll do you want a Mongoose for ?” “Well, you
see”, said the second man (in a confidential whisper) “my brother sees
snakes”. The hrst man was more puzzled than ever; but after a long
think, he continued rather pathetically : “But say, them ain’t real
snakes”. “Sure”, said the man with the basket, “but this Mongoose ain’t
real either”.</p>
<p>This is a perfect parable of Magick. There is no such thing</p>

<li><ol type="i">
<li><ol start="5" type="a">

<p>as trutli in the perceptible imiverse; every idea when analysecl is
fornid to contain a contradiction. It is quite useless (except as a
temporary expédient) to set up one class of ideas against another as
being “more real”. The advance of man towaids God is not necessarily an
advance towards truth. Ail philosophical Systems hâve crumbled. But each
class of ideas possesses true relations within itself. It is possible,
with Berkeley, 1 to deny the existence of water and of wood; but, for
ail that, wood fioats on water. The Magician becomes identical with the
imrnor- tal Osins, yet the Magician dies. In this dilemma the facts must
be restated. One should preferably say that the Magician becomes
tonscious of that part of himself which he calls the immortal Osins j
and that Part does not “die”.</p>
<p>Now this interior body of the Magician, of which we spoke at the
begmning of this chapter, does exist, and can exert certain powers which
his natural body cannot do. It can, for example, pass tirough matter ,
and it can move freelv in every direction * ni ough space. But this is
because “matter”, in the sense in which we commonly use the word, is on
another plane 2 .</p>
<p>Now this fine body perceives a uni verse which we do not ordinarily .
perceive. It does not necessarily perceive the universe which we do
normally perceive, so although in this body I can pass through the roof,
it does not follow that I shall be able to tell what the weather is
like. I might do so, or I might not; Dut if I could not, it would not
prove that I was deceiving myself m supposing that I had passed through
the roof. This body, which is called by varions authors the Astral
double, body of Light, body of fire, body of desire, fine body,
scin-laeca and numberless other naines is naturally fiited to perceive
objects of ils own class… in particular, the phantoms of the astral
plane.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>1 he real Berkeley did nothing of the sorti the reference here
is</li>
</ol>
<p>to an imaginary animal invented by Dr. Johnson ont of sturdy British
ignorance.</p>
<p>2 . We do not call electrical résistance, or économie îaws, unreal,
on the ground that they are not directly perceived by the senses. Gur
magical doctrine is universally accepted by sceptics — only they wish to
make Magick itseîf an exception!</p>
<p>H4 —</p>
<p>There is some sort of vague and indeterminate relation between the
Astrals and the Materials ; and it is possible, with great expérience,
to deduce facts about material things from the astral aspect which they
présent to the eyes of the Body of Light. 1 This astral plane is so
varied and so changeable that several clairvoyants looking at the same
thing might give totally different accounts of what they saw; yet they
might each make correct déductions. In looking at a man the first
clairvoyant might say : “The lines of force are ail drooping”; the
second : “It seems ail dirtv and spotty”; a third; “The Aura looks very
ragged.” Yet ail might agréé in deducing that the man was in ill-health.
In any case, ail such déductions are rather unreliable. One must be a
highly skilled man before one can trust one’s vision. A great many
people think that they are extremely good at the business, when in fact
they hâve onlv made some occasional shrewd guesses (which they naturallv
remember) in the course of hundreds of forgotten failures.</p>
<p>The onlv way to test clairvoyance is to keep a careful record of
every experiment made. For example, Frater O. M. once gave a clairvoyant
a waistcoat to psychometrize. He made 56 State- ments about the owner of
the waistcoat ; of these 4 were notably rightj 17, though correct, were
of that class of statement which is true of almost everybody. The
remainder were wrong. It was concluded from this that he showed no
evidence of any spécial power. In fact, his bodily eyes — if he could
discern Tailoring — would hâve served him better, for he thought the
owner of the vest was a corn-chandler, instead of an earl, as he is.</p>
<p>The Magician can hardi y take too much trouble to develop this power
in himself. It is extremely useful to him in guarding himself against
attack; in obtaining warnings, in judging character, and especially in
watching the process of his Ceremonies.</p>
<p>I. This is because there is a certain necessary correspondence
between planes; as in the case of an Anglo-Indian’s liver and his
temper. The relation appears “vague and indeterminate” only in so far as
one happens to be ignorant of the laws which State the case. The
situation is analo- gous to that of the chemist before the discovery of
the law of “Combining Weights”, etc.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>There are a great many ways of acquiring the power. Gaze into a
crvstal, or into a pool of ink in the palm of the hand, or into a
mirror, or into a teacup. Just as with a microscope the expert operator
keeps both eves open, though seeing only through the one at the
eye-piece of the instrument, so the natural eyes, ceasing to give anv
message to the brain, the attention is withdrawn from them, and the man
begins to see through the Astral eyes.</p>
<p>These methods appear to The Master Therion to be unsatisfactory. Very
often they do not work at ail. It is difficult to teach a person to use
these methods; and, worst of ali, they are purely passive! You can see
only what is shewn you, and you are probably shewn things perfectly
pointless and irrelevant.</p>
<p>The proper metnod is as followsi — Devciop the body oi Liglil until
îî is jiisl ns real to y ou as your otlier body. teacli it îo travel to
any desired Symbol, and enable it te perform ail neeessary Rites and
Invocations. In sbort, edncate it. Ultimately, the relation of that body
with your own must be exceedingly intimâtes but before this harmonizing
takes place, you should begin by a careful différentiation. The first
thing to do, therefore, is to get the body outside your own. To avoid
muddling the two, you begin by imagining a shape resem- bÜng yourself
standing in front of you. Do not say: “Oh, it’s only imagination!” lhe
time to test that is later on, when you hâve secured a fairly ciear
mental image of such a body. T’ry to ima¬ gine how your own body would
look if you were standing in its place j try to transfer your
consciousness to the Body of Light. Your own body has its eyes shut. Use
the eyes of the Body of Light to describe the objects in the room behind
you. Don’t say, “It’s</p>
<p>only an effort of subconscious memory”…the time to test that is later
on.</p>
<p>As soon as you feel more or less at home in the fine body, let it
rise in the air. Keep on feeling the sense of rising; keep on looking
about you as you rise until you see landscapes or beings of the astral
plane. Such hâve a quality ail their own. They are not like material
things — they are not like mental pictures — they seem to lie between
the two.</p>
<p>After some practice has made you adept, so that in the course</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>of an hour’s journey you can reckon on having a fairly eventful time,
turn your attention to rcaching a definite place on the astral plane j
invoke Mercury, for example, and examine carefully your record of the
resulting vision — discover whether the symbols which you hâve seen
correspond with the conventional symbols of Mercury.</p>
<p>Tliis iesting of the spirits is the most important branch of tlie
whoïe tree of Magick. Without it, one is lost in the jungle of delusion.
Every spirit, up to God himself, is ready to deceive you if possible, to
make himself ont more important than lie is; in short, to lay in wait
for your soûl in 333 separate ways. Remember thaï after ail the highest
of ail the Gods is en!y the Magus, 1 Mayan, the greatest of ail the
devils.</p>
<p>Your may also try “rising on the planes”. 2 With a little practice,
especially if you hâve a good Guru, you ought to be able to slip in and
out of your astral body as easily as you slip and out of a
dressing-gown. It will then no longer be so necessary for your astral
body to be sent far off ; without moving an inch you will be able to
“turn on” its eyes and ears — as simplv as the man with the microscope
(mentioned above) can transfer his complété attention from one eye to
the other.</p>
<p>Now, however unsuceessful your geîting ouï of the body may apparently
hâve been, it is most necessary to use every effort to bring it properly
back. Make the Body of Light coincide in space with the physica! body,
assume the God- Form, and vibrate the name of lïarpocrates with the
utmost energy; then recover unity of consciousness. If you fail to do
this properly you may find vourself in serious trouble. Your Body of
Light may wander away uncontrolled, and be attacked and obsessed. You
will become aware of this through the occurrence of headache, bad
dreams, or even more serious signs such as hysteria, fainting fits,
possibly madness or paralysis. Even the worst of these attacks will
probably wear off, but it may leave you permanently damaged to a greater
or less extent.</p>

</ol>
<p>— 147</p>
<p>A great majority of “spiritualists”, “occultists”, “Toshos- ophists”,
are pitiable examples of repeated losses from this cause.</p>
<p>The emotional type of religionist also suffers in this way. Dévotion
projects the fine body, which is seized and vampirized by the démon
masquerading as “Christ” or “Mary”, or whoever may be the object of
worship. Complété absence of ail power to concentrate thought, to follow
an argument, to formulate a Will, to hold fast to an opinion or a course
of action, or even to keep a solemn oath, mark indelibly those who hâve
thus lost parts of their soûls. They wander from one new cuit to another
even crazier. Occasionally such persons drift for a moment into the
surroundmgs of The Master Therion, and are shot out by the simple
process of making them try to do a half-hour 5 s honest work of any
kind.</p>
<p>In projecting the Astral, it is a valtiable additional safe- gnard to
perform the whole operation m a properïy con- secrated circle.</p>
<p>Proceed with great caution, then, but proceed. In time your Body of
Light will be as strong against the spirits as your other body against
the winds of Heaven. Ail dépends upon the develop¬ ment of that Body of
Light. It must be furnished with an organism as ramified and balanced as
its shadowy brother, the material body.</p>
<p>To recapitulate once more, then, the first task is to develop your
own Body of Light within your own circle with out reference to any other
inhabitants of the world to which it belongs.</p>
<p>That which you hâve accomplished with the subject you may now proceed
to do with the object. You will learn to see the astral appearance of
material thingSj and although this does not properïy belong to pure
clairvoyance, one may here again mention that you should endeavour to
the utmost to develop and forîify this Body of Light. The hest and
simpîest way to do this is to use it constantly, to exercise it in every
way. In particular it may be employed in ceremonies of initiation or of
invocation — w r hile the physical body remains silent and still.</p>
<p>In doing this it will often be necessary to create a Temple on the
astral plane. Il is excellent practice to create symbols. This one
précaution is needed: after using them, they should be reabsorbed.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>Having learned to create astral forms, the next step will be at first
very difficult. Phantasmal and fleeting as the astral is in general,
those forms which are definitely attached to the material possess
enormous powers of résistance, and it consequently requires very high
potential to influence them. Their material analogues seem to serve as a
fortress. Even where a temporary effect is produced, the inertia of
matter draws it back to the normal; yet the power of the trained and
consecrated will in a well-deveioped astral body is such that it can
even produce a permanent change in the material upon whose Body of Light
you are working, e.g. ; one can heal the sick bv restoring a healthy
appearance to their astral forms. On the other hand, it is possible so
to disintegrate the the Body of Light even of a strong man that he will
fall dead.</p>
<p>Such operations demand not only power, but judgment. Nothing can
upset the sum total of destiny — everything must be paid for the
uttermost farthing. For this reason a great many operations
theoretically possible cannot be performed. Suppose, for example, you
see two men of similarly unhealthy astral appearance. In one case the
cause may be slight and temporary. Your help suffices to restore him in
a few minutes. The other, who looks no worse, is really oppressed by a
force incalculably greater than you could control, and you would only
damage yourself by attempting to help him. The diagnosis between the two
cases could be made by an investigation of the deeper strata of the
astral, such as compose the “causal body”.</p>
<p>A body of black magicians under Anna Kingsford 1 once attempted to
kill a vivisector who was not particularly well known; and they
succeeded in making him seriously ill. But in attempting the same thing
with Pasteur they produced no effect whatever, because Pasteur was a
great genius — an adept in his own line far greater than she in h ers —
and because millions of people were daily blessing him. It cannot be too
clearly nnderstood that magical force is snbject to the same ïaws of
proportion as any other kind of force. It is useless for a mere
millionaire to try to bankrupt a man who has the Bank of England behind
him.</p>
<p>I. Anna Kingsford, so far as her good work is concerned, was only the
rubber stamp of Edward Maitland.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>To sum up, the first task is to separate the astral form from the
physical body, the second to develop the powers of the astral body, in
particular those o£ sight, travel, and interprétation 3 third, to unify
the two boclies without muddling them.</p>
<p>This being accomplished, the magician is htted to deai with the
invisible.</p>
<p>Il</p>
<p>It is now useful to continue with considérations of other planes,
which hâve commonly been classed under the Astral. There is some reason
for this, as the délimitations are somewhat vague. Just as the vegetable
kingdom merges into the animal, and as the material plane has beings
which encroach upon the boundaries of the astral, so do we hnd it in the
higher planes.</p>
<p>The mental images which appear during méditation are subjec¬ tive,
and pertain not at ail to the astral plane. Only verv rarely do astral
images occur during méditation. It is a bad break in the circle, as a
rule, when they do.</p>
<p>There is also a Magical Plane. This touches the material, and even
includes a portion of it. It includes the Astral, chiefly a fuli-
blooded type of the Astral. It reaches to and includes most, if not ail,
of the spiritual planes.</p>
<p>The Magical plane is thus the most comprehensive of ail. Egyptian
Gods are typical inhabitants of this plane, and it is the home of every
Adept.</p>
<p>The spiritual planes are of several types, but are ail distinguished
by a reality and intensitv to be found nowhere else. Their inhabitants
are formless, free of space and time, and distinguished by incomparable
brilliance.</p>
<p>There are also a number of sub-planes, as, for example, the
Alchemical. This plane wiil often appear in the practice of u Rising on
the Planes” ; its images are usually those of gardens curiously kept,
mountains furnished with peculiar symbols, hiero- glyphic animais, or
such figures as that of the a Hermetic Arcanum”, and pictures like the
“Goldseekers” and the ’Mas¬ sacre of the Innocents” of Basil Valentine.
There is a unique quality about the alchemical Plane which renders its
images imme- diately recognisable.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>The are also planes corresponding to various religions past and
présent, ail of which hâve their peculiar unity.</p>
<p>ïi is of the utmost importance to tlie “Clairvoyant” or Hraveller in
the fine body to be able to find bis way to any desired plane, and
operate therein as itts rnler.</p>
<p>The Neopliyte of A.*. A.’, is examined most strict ly in tliis
practice before he is passed to the degree of Zelaîor.</p>
<p>In “Rising on the Planes” one must usuallv pass clear through the
Astral to the Spiritual. Sonie will be unable to do this. The “fine
body” which is good enough to subsist on lower planes, a shadow among
shadows, will fail to penetrate the higher strata. It requires a great
development of this body,and an intense infusion of the highest
spiritual constituents of man, before he can pierce the veils. The
constant practice of Magick is the best préparation possible. Even
though the human consciousness fail to reach the goal, the consciousness
of the fine body itself may do so, wherefore whoso travels in that body
on a subséquent occasion may be found worthyj and its success will react
favourably on the human consciousness, and increase its likelihood of
success in its next magical operation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the powers gained in this way will strengthen the magician
in his meditation-practices. His Will becomes better able to assist the
concentration, to destroy the mental images which disturb it, and to
reject the lesser rewards of that practice which tempt, and too often
stop the progress of, the mystic.</p>
<p>Although it is said that the spiritual lies “beyond the astral”, this
is theoreticalj 1 the advanced Magician will not find it to be so in
practice. He will be able by suitable invocation to travel directly to
any place desired. In Liber 418 an example of perfection is given. The
Adept who explored these Aethyrs did not hâve to pass through and beyond
the Universe, the whole of which yet lies within even the inmost (30th)
Aethyr. He was able to summon the Aethyrs he wanted, and His chief
difficulty was that sometimes</p>
<p>I. The Hon. Bertrand Russell’s Princifia Mathemcitica may be said to
“lie beyond” Colenso’s School Arithmetic; but one can take the former
book from one’s shelves — as every one should — and read it without
first going ail through the latter again.</p>
<p>He was at first unable to pierce their veils. In fact, as the Book
shows, it was only by virtue o£ successive and most exalted initia¬
tions undergone in the Aethyrs themselves that He was able to penetrate
beyond the I5th. The Guardians of such fortresses know how to guard.</p>
<p>The Master Therion has published the most important prac- tical
magical secrets in the plainest language. No one, by virtue °£ being
clever or learned, has understood one word; and those unworthy who hâve
profaned the sacrament hâve but eaten and drunken damnation to
themselves.</p>
<p>One may bring down stolen fire in a hollow tube from Heaven, as The
Master Therion indeed has done in a way that no other adept dared to do
before him. But the thief, the Titan, must foreknow and consent to his
doom to be chained upon a lonely rock, the vulture devouring his liver,
for a season, until Hercules, the strong man armed by virtue of that
very fire, shall corne and release him.</p>
<p>The Teitan 1 — whose number is the number of a man, six hundred and
three score and six — unsubdued, consoled by Asia and Panthea, must send
forth constant showers of blessing not onlv upon Man whose incarnation
he is, but upon the tyrant and the persecutor. His infinité pain must
thrill his heart with joy, since every pang is but the écho of some new
flame that leaps upon the earth lit by his crime.</p>
<p>For the Gods are the enemies of Man; it is Nature that Man must
overcome ere he enter into his kingdom. 2 The true God</p>

<li><p>In another sense, a higher sense, Nature is absolutely right
through- ou t* The position is that the Magician discovers himself
imprisoned in a distorted Nature of Iniquity; and his task is to
disentangle it. This is ail to be studied in the Book of Wisdom or Folly
(Liber ALEPH, CXI) and in The Master Therion’s édition of the Tao T eh
King. A rough note from His Magical Diary is appended here :</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Ail éléments must at one time hâve been separate, — that would be
the case with great heat. Now when atoms get to the sun, when we get to
the sun, we get that immense, extreme heat, and ail the éléments are
themselves again. Imagine that each atom of each element possesses the
memory of ail his adventures in combination. By the way, that atom</p>
<p>— 152 —</p>
<p>is man. In man are ail things hidden, Of these the Gods, Nature,
Time, ail the powers of the universe are rebellions slaves. It is these
that men must fight and conquer in the power and in the name of the
Beast that hath availed them, the Titan, the Magus, the Man whose number
is six hundred and three score and six.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Ihe practice of Rising on the Planes is of such importance that
spécial attention must be paid to it. It is part of the essential tech¬
nique of Magick. Instruction in this practice has been given with such
conciseness in Liber O, that one cannot do better than quote Verbatim
(the “previous experiment” referred to in the first sen¬ tence is the
ordinary astral journey.) :</p>
<p>“i. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few
results of importance. But it is susceptible of a development which
merges into a form of Dharana — concentration — and as such may lead to
the very highest ends. The principal use of the practice in</p>
<p>(fortiheci with that memory) would not be the same atom; yet it is,
because it has gained nothing from anywhere except this memory.
Therefore, by the lapse of time, and by virtue of memory, a thing could
become something more than itself; and thus a real development is
possible. One can then see a reason for any element deciding to go
through this sériés of incarnations; because so, and only so, can he go;
and he suffers the lapse of memory which he has during these
incarnations, because he knows he will corne through unchanged.</p>
<p>“Therefore you can hâve an infinité number of gods, individual and
equal though diverse, each one suprême and utterly indestructible. This
is also the only explanation of how a being could create a war in which
war, evil, etc. exist. Evil is only an appearance, because, (like
“good”) it cannot affect the substance itself, but only multiply its
combinations. This is something the same as mystic monotheism, but the
objection to that theory is that God has to create things which are ail
parts of himself, so that their interplay is false. If we présupposé
many éléments, their interplay is natural. It is no objection to this
theory to ask who made the éléments, — the éléments are at least there,
and God, when you look for him, is not there. Theism is obscurum per
obscurius. A male star is built up from the centre outwards; a female
from the circumference inwards. This is what is meant when we say that
woman has no soûl. It explains fully the différence between the
sexes.</p>
<p>— 153</p>
<p>the last chapter is to familiarise the student with every kind of
obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he may be perfect master of
every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, to transmute it,
to cause it instantly to obey his will.</p>
<p>u 2. Let him then begin exactly as before; but with the most intense
solemnitv and détermination.</p>
<p>“3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise in a
line exactly perpendicular to the earth’s tangent at the point where his
physical body is situated (or, to put it more simply, straight
upwards).</p>
<p>“4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue
almost overcomes him. If he should find that he has stopped without
willing to do so, and that figures appear, let him at ail costs rise
above them. Yea, though his very life tremble on his lips, let him force
his way upward and onward !</p>
<p>“5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in him.
Whatever threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and ail his
hosts loosed from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from
the very Throne of God himself that a voice issues bidding him stay and
be content, let him struggle on, ever on.</p>
<p>“6. At last there must corne a moment when his whole being is
swallowed up in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia. Let him sink
(when no longer can he strive, though his tongue be bitten through with
the effort and the blood gush from his nostrils) into the blackness of
unconsciousness ; and then on coming to himself, let him Write down
soberly and accurately a record of ail that hath occurred : yea, a
record of ail that hath occurred.”</p>
<p>Of course, the Rising may be done from any starting point. One can go
(for example) into the circle of Jupiter, and the results, especially in
the lower planes, will be very different to those obtained from a
Saturnian starting point.</p>
<p>The student should undertake a regular) sériés of such experiments,
in order to familiarise himself not only with the nature of the
different spheres, but with the inner meaning of each. Of course, it is
not necessary in every case to push the</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>practice to exhaustion, as described in the instructions, but this is
the proper thing to do whenever definitely practising, in order to
acquire the power of Rising. But, having obtained this power, it is, of
course, legitimate to rise to any particular plane that may be necessary
for the purpose of exploration, as in the case of the visions recorded
in Liber 418, where the method may be described as mixed. In such a
case, it is not enough to invoke the place you wish to visit, because
you may not be able to endure its pressure, or to breathe its
atmosphère. Several instances occur in that record where the seer was
unable to pass through certain gateways, or to remain in certain
contemplations. He had to undergo certain Initiations before he was able
to proceed. Thus, it is necessary that the technique of Magick should he
perfected. The Body of Light nmst be rendered capable of going every-
where and doing everything. It is, therefore, always the question of
drill which is of importance. You hâve got to go out Rising on the
Planes every day of your life, year after year. You are not to be
disheartened by failure, or too much encouraged by success, in any one
practice or set of practices. What you are doing is what will be of real
value to you in the end j and that is, developing a character, creating
a Karma, which will give you the power to do your Will.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Divination is so important a bran ch of Magick as almost to demand a
separate treatise.</p>
<p>Genius is composed of two sidesj the active and the passive. The
power to execute the Will is but blind force unless the Will be
enlightened. At every stage of a Magical Operation it is necessary to
know what one is doing, and to be sure that one is acting wisely. Acute
sensitiveness is always associated with genius; the power to perceive
the universe accurately, to analyse, coordinate, and judge impressions
is the foundation of ail great Work. An army is but a blundering brute
unless its intelligence department Works as it should.</p>
<p>The Magician obtains the transcendental knowledge necessary to an
intelligent course of conduct directly in consciousness by clairvoyance
and clairaudience; but communication with superior</p>
<p>— 155</p>
<p>intelligences demands elaborate préparation, even after years of
successful performance.</p>
<p>It is therefore useful to possess an art by which one can obtain at a
moments notice any information that may be necessary. This art is
divination. The answers to one’s questions in divination are not
conveyed directly but through the medium of a suitable sériés of
symbols. These symbols must be interpreted by the diviner in terms of
his problem. It is not practicable to construct a lexicon in which the
solution of every difficulty is given in so many words. It would be
unwieldy 3 besides, nature does not happen to work on those lines.</p>
<p>The theory of any process of divination may be stated in a few simple
terms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We postulate the existence of intelligences, either within or
without the diviner, of which he is not immediately conscious. (It does
not matter to the theory whether the communicating spirit so-called is
an objective entity or a concealed portion of the diviner’s mind.) We
assume that such intelligences are able to reply correctly — within
limits — to the questions asked.</p></li>
<li><p>We postulate that it is possible to construct a compendium of
hieroglyphs sufficiently elastic in meaning to include every possible
idea, and that one or more of these may always be taken to represent any
idea. We assume that any of these hieroglyphics will be understood by
the intelligences with whom we wish to communicate in the same sense as
it is by ourselves. We hâve therefore a sort of language. One may
compare it to a lingua jranca which is perhaps defective in expressing
fine shades of meaning, and so is unsuitable for literature, but which
yet serves for the conduct of daily affairs in places where many tongues
are spoken. Hindustani is an example of this. But better still is the
analogy between the conventional signs and symbols employed by
mathematicians, who can thus convey their ideas perfectly 1 without
speaking a Word of each other’s languages.</p></li>
<li><p>As a matter of fact, they cannot. The best qualified are the most
diffident as to having grasped the meaning of their colleagues with
exactitude; in criticising their writings they often make a point of
apologis- ing for possible misunderstanding.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 156</p>
<p>3 - . We postulate that the intelligences whom we wish to consult are
willing, or may be compelled, to answer us truthfully.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the question of the compendium of symbols. The
alphabet of a language is a more or less arbitrary way of transcribing
the sounds employed in speaking it. The letters tnemselves h ave not
necessarily any meaning as such. But in a System of divination each
Symbol stands for a definite idea. It would not interfère with the
English language to add a few new letters. In fact, some Systems of
shorthand hâve done so. But a System of symbols suitable for divination
must be a complété représentation of the Universe, so that each is
absolute, and the whole insusceptible of increase or diminution. It is
(in fact) tech- nically a pantacle in the fullest sense of the word.</p>
<p>Let us consider some prominent examples of such System. We may
observe that a common mode of divination is to inquire of books by
placing the thumb at random within the leaves. The Books of the Sybil,
the Works of Vergil, and the Bible hâve been used ’very frequently for
this purpose. For theoretical justification, one must assume that the
book employed is a perfect représentation of the Universe. But even if
this were the case, it is an inferior form of construction, because the
only reasonable conception of the Cosmos is mathematical and
hieroglyphic rather than literary. In the case of a book, such a book as
the Book of the Law which is the suprême truih and the perfect rule of
life, it is not répugnant to good sense to dérivé an oracle from its
pages. It will of course be remarked that the Book of the Law is not
mereiy a literary compilation but a complex mathematical structure. It
îherefore fulfiïs the required conditions.</p>
<p>The principal means of divination in history are astrology, geo-
mancy, the Tarot, the Holy Qabalah, and the Yi King. There aie hundreds
of othersj from pyromancy, oneiromancy, auguries from sacrifices, and
the spinning-top of some ancient oracles to the omens drawn from the
flight of birds and the prophesying or tea-leaves. It will be sufficient
for our présent purpose to discuss only the five Systems first
enumerated.</p>
<p>Astrology is theoretically a perfect method, since the symbols
employed actually exist in the macrocosm, and thus possess a</p>
<p>— x 57</p>
<p>natural correspondence with microcosmic affairs. But in practice the
calculations involved are overwhelmingly complicated. A horoscope is
never complété. It needs to be supplemented by innumerable other
horoscopes. For example, to obtain a judgment on the simplest question,
one requires not only the nativities of the people involved, some of
which are probably inaccessible, but secondary figures for directions
and transits, together with pro- gressed horoscopes, to say nothing of
prénatal, mundane, and even horary figures. To appreciate the entire
mass of data, to balance the éléments of so vast a concourse of forces,
and to draw a single judgment therefrom, is a task practically beyond
human capacity. Besides ail this, the actual efîects of the planetary
posi¬ tions and aspects are still almost entirely unknown. No two astro-
logers agréé on ail points 5 and most of them are at odds on fonda¬
mental principles. 1 This science had better be discarded unless the
student chances to feel strongly drawn toward it. It is used by the
Master Therion Himself with fairly satisfactory results, but only in
spécial cases, in a strictly limited sphere, and with par- ticular
précautions. Even so, He feels great diffidence in basing His conduct on
the resuit so obtained.</p>
<p>Geomancy has the advantage of being rigorously mathematical. A
hand-book of the science is to be found in Equinox I, II. The objection
to its use lies in the limited number of the symbols. To represent the
Universe by no more than 16 combinations throws too much work upon them.
There is also a great restriction arising from the fact that although 15
symbols appear in the final figure, there are, in reality, but 4, the
remaining 11 being drawn by an inéluctable process from the “Mothers”.
It may be added that the tables given in the handbook for the
interprétation of the figure are exceedingly vague on the one hand, and
insufficiently comprehensive on the other. Some Adepts, however, appear
to find this System admirable, and obtain great satisfaction from its
use. Once more, the personal équation must be allowed full weight. At
one time the Master Therion employed it exten- sivelyj but He was never
wholly at ease with it 5 He found the</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nearly ail professional astrologers are ignorant of their own sub-
ject, as of ail others.</li>
</ol>
<p>158 -</p>
<p>interprétation very difficult. Moreover, it seemed to Him that the
geomantic intelligences themselves were of a low order, the scope of
which was confined to a small section of the things which interested
Him* also, they possessed a point of view of their own which was far
from sympathetic with His, so that misunder- standing constantly
interfered with the Work.</p>
<p>The Tarot and The Holy Qabalah may be discussed to- gether. The
theoretical basis of both is identical: The Tree of Life. 1 The 78
symbols of the Tarot are admirably balanced and combined. lhey are
adéquate to ail demands made upon them; each Symbol is not only
mathematically précisé, but possesses an artistic significance which
helps the diviner to understand them by stimulating his aesthetic
perceptions. The Master Therion finds that the Tarot is infallible in
material questions. The successive operations describe the course of
events with astonishing wealth of detail, and the judgments are reliable
in ail respects. But a proper divination means at least two hours’ hard
work, even by the improved method developed by Him from the traditions
of initiâtes. Any attempt to shorten the proceedings leads to
disappointment; furthermore, the symbols do not lend them¬ selves
readily to the solution of spiritual questions.</p>
<p>The Holy Qabalah, based as it is on pure number, evi- dently
possesses an infinité number of symbols. ïts scope is conterminous with
existence itself; and it lacks nothing in précision, purity, or indeed
in any other perfection. But it cannot be taught; 2 each man must select
for himseif the materials for the main structure of his System. It
requires years of work to erect a worthy building. Such a building is
never finished; every day spent on it adds new ornaments. The Qabalah is
therefore a living Temple of the Holy Ghost. It is the man himseif and
his universe expressed in terms of thought whose</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Both these subjects may be studied in the Equinox in several
articles appearing in several numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>It is easy to teach the General Princi.ples of exegesis, and the
main doctrines. There is a vast body of knowledge common to ail cases;
but this is no more than the basis on which the student must erect his
original</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Research.</p>
<p>159 —</p>
<p>language is so rich that even the letters of its alphabet hâve no
limit. This System is so sublime that it is unsuited to the solution of
the petty puzzles of our earthly existence. In the light’of</p>
<p>the Qabalah, the shadows of transitory things are instantly
banished.</p>
<p>Xhe Y i King is the most satisfactory System for general work. The
Master Therion is engagea in the préparation of a treatise on the
subject, but the labour involved is so great that He cannot pledge
Himself to hâve it ready at any definite time. The ôtudent must
theiefoie make his own investigations mto the mean- ing of the 64
hexagrams as best he can.</p>
<p>The Yi King is mathematical and philosophical in form. lîs structure
is cognate with that of the Qahalah $ the identity is so intimate that
the existence of two such superficially different Systems is
transcendent testimony to the truth of hoth. It is in some ways the most
perfect hieroglyph ever constructed. It is austere and sublime, yet
withal so adaptable to every possible emergency that its figures may be
interpreted to suit ail classes of questions. One may résolve the most
obscure spiritual difficultés no less than the most mundane dilemmas;
and the symbol which opens the gates of the most exalted palaces of
initiation is equally effective when employed to advise one in the
ordinary business of life. The Master Therion has found the Yi King
entirely satisfactory in every respect. The intelligences which direct
it show no inclination to évadé the question or to mislead the querent.
A further advantage is that the actual apparatus is simple. Also the
System is easy to manipulate, and five minutes is sufficient to obtain a
fairly detailed answer to any but the most obscure questions.</p>
<p>With regard to the intelligences whose business it is to give
information to the diviner, their natures differ widely, and corre¬
spond more or less to the character of the medium of divination. Thus,
the geomantic intelligences are gnomes, spirits of an earthy nature,
distinguished from each other by the modifications due to the various
planetary and zodiacal influences which pertain to the several symbols.
The intelligence governing Puella is not to be confused with that of
Venus or of Libra. It is simply a particular terrestrial daemon which
partakes of those natures.</p>
<p>— 160 —</p>
<p>lhe Tarot, on the other hand, being a book, is under Mercury, and the
intelligence of each card is fundamentally Mercurial. Such symbols are
therefore peculiarly proper to communicate thought. Ihey are not gross,
like the geomantic daemons; but, as against this, they are unscrupulous
in deceiving the diviner. 1</p>
<p>The Y i King is served by beings free from these defects. The intense
purity of the symbols prevent them from being usurped by intelligences
with an axe of their own to grind. 2</p>
<p>It is always essential lor the diviner to obtain absolute magical
control over the intelligences of the System which lie adopts. He must
not leave the smallest loop-hole for being tricked, befogged, or mocked.
He must not allow them to use casuistry in the interprétation of his
questions. It is a common knavery, especially in geomancy, to render an
answer which is literally true, and yet deceives. For instance, one
might ask whether some business transaction would be profitable, and
find, after getting an affirmative answer, that it really referred to
the other party to the affair!</p>
<p>There is, on the surface, no difficulty at ail in getting replies. In
fact, the process is mechanical; success is therefore assured, bar a
stroke of apoplexy. But, even suppose we are safe from deceit, how can
we know that the question has really been put to another mind,
understood rightly, and answered from knowledge ? It is obviously
possible to check one’s operations by clairvoyance, but this is rather
like buying a safe to keep a brick in. Expérience is the only teacher.
One acquires what one may almost calî a new sense. One feels in one’s
self whether one is right or not. The diviner must develop this sense.
It resembles the exquisite sensibility of touch which is found in the
great billiard player whose fingers can estimate infinitésimal degrees
of force,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This does not mean that they are malignant. They hâve a proper pride
in their office as Oracles of Truth; and they refuse to be profaned by
the contamination of inferior and impure intelligences. A Magician whose
research is fuily adapted to his Neschamah will hnd them lucid and
reliable.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . Malicious or pranksome elementals instinctively avoid the austere
sincerity of the Figures of Fu and King Wan.</p>
<p>— 161 —</p>
<p>or the similar phenomenon in the professional taster of tea or wine
who can distinguish fantastîcallv subtle différences of flavour.</p>
<p>It is a hard saying; but in order to divine without error, one ought
to be a Master of the Temple, Divination affords excellent practice for
those who aspire to that exalted eminence, for the faintest breath of
personal preference will deflect the needle from the pôle of trnth in
the answer. Unies? the diviner hâve banished utterly from his mind the
minutest atom of interest in the answer to his question, he is almost
certain to influence that answer in favour of his personal
inclinations.</p>
<p>The psycho-analyst will recall the fact that dreams are phantas- mal
représentations of the unconscious Will of the sleeper, and that not
only are they images of that Will instead of représent¬ ations of
objective truth, but the image itself is confused by a thousand
cross-currents set in motion by the various complexes and inhibitions of
his character. If therefore one consults the oracle, one must take sure
that one is not consciously or uncons- ciously bringing pressure to bear
upon it. It is just as when an Englishman cross-examines a Hindu, the
ultimate answer will be what the Hindu imagines will best please the
inquirer.</p>
<p>The same difficulty appears in a grosser form when one receives a
perfectly true reply, but insists on interpreting it so as to suit one’s
desires. The vast majority of people who go to “fortune- tellers” hâve
nothing else in mind but the wish to obtain super- natural sanction for
their follies. Apart from Occultism alto- gether, every one knows that
when people ask for advice, they only want to be told how wise they are.
Hardly any one acts on the most obviously commonsense counsel if it
happens to clash with his previous intentions. Indeed, who would take
counsel unless he were warned by some little whisper in his heart that
he was about to make a fool of himself, which he is determined to do,
and only wants to be able to blâme his best friend, or the oracle, when
he is overtaken by the disaster which his own interior mentor foresees
?</p>
<p>Those who embark on divination will be wise to consider the foregoing
remarks very deeply. They will know when they are getting deep enough by
the fact of the thought beginning to hurt them. It is essential to
explore oneself to the utmost, to analyse</p>
<p>— 162</p>
<p>one’s minci until one can be positive, beyond the possibility of
error, that one is able to detach oneself entirely from the question.
The oracle is a judgej it must be beyond bribery and préjudice.</p>
<p>It is impossible in practice to lay down rules for the inter¬
prétation of symbols. Their nature must be investigated by intel-
lectual methods such as the Qabalah, but the précisé shape of meaning in
any one case, and the sphere and tendency of its application, must be
acquired partlv by expérience, that is, by induction, by recording and
classifying one’s experiments over a long période and — this is the
better part — by refining one’s ratiocination to the point where it
becomes instinct or intuition, whichever one likes to call it.</p>
<p>It is proper in cases where the sphere of the question is well marked
to begin the divination by invocations of the forces thereto
appropriate. An error of judgment as to the true character of the
question would entail penalties proportionate to the extent of that
error 3 and the delusions resulting from a divination fortified by
invocation would be more serious than if one had not employed such heavy
artillery. 3</p>
<p>There can, however, be no objection to preparing oneself by a general
purification and consécration devised with the object of detaching
oneself from one’s personality and increasing the sensitiveness of one’s
faculties.</p>
<p>Ail divination cornes under the general type of the element Air. The
peculiar properties of air are in conséquence its uniform charac-
teristics. Divination is subtle and intangible. It moves with mysterious
ease, expanding, contracting, fJowing, responsive to the slightest
stress. It receives and transmits every Vibration without retaining any.
It becomes poisonous when its oxygen is defiled by passing through human
lungs.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar frame of mind necessary to successful divination.
The conditions of the problem are difficult. It is obviously necessary
for the mind of the diviner to be concentrated absolutely upon his
question. Any intrusive thought will confuse the oracle as certainly as
the reader of a newspaper is confused</p>
<p>I. The apparent high sanction for the error would fortify the
obstinacy of the mule.</p>

intelligence whom he is Consulting, to be guided in their movement to
make the necessary mechanical actions which détermine the physical
factor of the operation. It will be obvions that this is somewhat
awkward for the diviner who is also a magician, for as a magician he has
been constantly at work to keep ail his forces uncler his own control,,
and to prevent the slighest interférence with them by any alien Will. It
is, in fact, commonly the case, or so says the expérience of The Master
Therion, that the most promising Magicians are the most déplorable
diviners, and vice versa. It is only when the aspirant approaches
perfection that he becomes able to reconcile these two apparently
opposing faculties. Indeed, there is no surer sign of all-round success
than this ability to put the whole of one’s powers at the service of any
type of task.</p>
<p>With regard to the mind, again, it would seem that concentra¬ tion on
the question makes more difficult the necessary detachment from it. Once
again, the diviner stands in need of a considérable degree of attainment
in the practices of méditation. He must hâve succeeded in destroying the
tendency of the ego to interfère with the ohject of thought. He must be
able to conceive of a thing out of ail relation with anything eise. The
regular practice of concentration leads to this resuit; in fact, it
destroys the thing itself as we hâve hitherto conceived it; for the
nature of things is always veiled from us by our habit of regarding them
as in essential relation with ourselves and our reactions toward
them.</p>
<p>One can hardly expect the diviner to make Samadhi with his question —
that would be going too far, and destroy the character of the operation
by removing the question from the class of concatenated ideas. It would
mean interpreting the question in terms of “without limit”, and thus
imply an equally formless answer. But he should approximate to this
extreme sufficiently to allow ihe question entire freedom to make for
itself ils own proper links with the intelligence directing the
answer,</p>
<p>— 164 —</p>
<p>preserving its position on its own plane, and evoking the necessary
counterpoise to its own déviation from the norm of nothingness.</p>
<p>\ e may recapitulate the above reflections in a practical form. We
will suppose that one wishes to divine by geomancy whether or no one
should marry, it being assumed that one’s emotional impulses suggest so
rash a course. The man takes his wand and his sand; he traces the
question, makes the appropriate pentagram, and the sigil of the spirit.
Before tracing the dashes which are to détermine the four “Mothers”, he
must strictly examine himself. He must banish from his mind every
thought which can possibly act as an attachment to his proposed partner.
He must banish ail thoughts which concern himself, those of appré¬
hension no less than those of ardour. He must carry his introspec¬ tion
as far as possible. He must observe with ail the subtletv at his command
whether it pains him to abandon any of these thoughts. So long as his
mind is stirred, however slightly, by one single aspect of the subject,
he is not fit to begin to form the figure. He must sink his persouality
in that of the intel¬ ligence hearing the question propounded by a
sîrarager to whom he is indifferent, but whom it is his business to
serve faithfully. He must now run over the whole affair in his mind,
making sure of his utter aloofness therefrom. He must also make sure
that his muscles are perfectly free to respond to the touch of the Will
of that intelligence. (It is of course understood that he has not become
so familiar with geomancy by dint of practice as to be able to calculate
subconsciously what figures he will form; form; for this would vitiate
the experiment entirely. It is, in fact, one of the objections to
geomancy that sooner or later one does become aware at the time of
tracing them whether the dots are going to be even or odd. This needs a
spécial training to correct).</p>
<p>Physio-psychological theory will probably maintain that the
“automatic” action of the hand is controlled by the brain no less than
in the case of conscious volition; but this is an additional argument
for identiiying the brain with the intelligence invoked.</p>
<p>Having thus identified himself as closely as possible with that
intelligence, and concentrated on the question as if the “prophe- sying
spirit” were giving its whole attention thereto, he must</p>
<p>— 165 —</p>
<p>await the impulse to trace the marks on the sand; and, as soon as it
cornes let it race to the finish. Here arises another technical
difficulty. One has to make 16 rows of dots; and, especialiy for the
beginner, the mind has to grapple with the appréhension lest the hand
fail to execute the required number. It is also troubled by fearing to
exceed; but excess does not matter. Extra Unes are simply null and void,
so that the best plan is to banish that thought, and make sure only of
not stopping too soon. 1</p>
<p>The lines being traced, the operation is over as far as spiritual
qualifies are required, for a time. The process of setting up the figure
for judgment is purely mechanical.</p>
<p>But, in the judgment, the diviner stands once more in need of his
mmost and utmost attainments. He sbould exhaust tlie infcellectual
sources of information at Iiis disposai, and form from them his
jodgment. But having done this, lie should deîacli Iiis mind from wliat
it lias just formulated, and proceed to concentrate it on tlie figure as
a whole, aîmost as if it were tlie object of bis méditation. One need
hardly repeat that in both these operations detachment from one’s
personal partialities is as necessary as it was in the first part of the
work. In setting up the figure, bias would beget a Freudian phantasm to
replace the image of truth which the figure ought to be; and it is not
too much to say that the entire subconscious machinery of the body and
mind lends itself with horrid willingness to this ape- like antic of
treason. But now that the figure stands for judgment, the same bias
Vvouid tend to form its phantasm of wish-fulfilment in a different
manner. It would act through the mind to bewray sound judgment. It
might, for example, induce one to emphasize the Venereal element in
Puella at the expense of the Saturnian.</p>
<p>-i.</p>
<p>It might lead one to underrate the influence of a hostile figure, or
to neglect altogether some element of importance. The Master Therion has
known cases where the diviner was so afraid of an unfavourable answer
that he made actual mistakes in the simple mechanical construction of
the figure! Finally, in the</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Practice soon teaches one to count subconsciously.yes, and that</li>
</ol>
<p>is the other difficulty again!</p>
<p>— i66 —•</p>
<p>summing up; it is fatally easy to slur over unpleasantness, and to
breathe on the tiniest spark that promises to kindle the tinder — the
rotten rags! —of hope.</p>
<p>The concluding operation is therefore to obtain a judgment of the
figure, independent of ail iutellectual or moral restraint. One must
endeavour to appreliend it as a thing absolute in itself. One must treat
it, in short, very much the same as one did the question $ as a mystical
entity, till now unrelated with other phenomena. One must, so to speak,
adore it as a god, uncritically: a Speak, Lord, for thy servant
heareth.” Il must be allowed to impose iis intrinsic individuality on
the mind, to put its fingers independently on whatever notes it
pleases.</p>
<p>In this way one obtains an impression of the true purport of the
answerj and one obtains it armed with a sanction superior to any
sensible suggestions. It cornes from and to a part of the individual
which is independent of the influence of environment ; is adjusted to
that environment by true necessity, and not by the artifices of such
adaptations as our purblind conception of convenience induces us to
fabricate.</p>
<p>The student will observe from the above that divination is in one
sense an art entirely separate from that of Magick; y et it
interpénétrâtes Magick at every point. The fundamental laws of both are
identical. The right use of divination has already been explained; but
it must be added that proficiency therein, tremendous as is its
importance in furnishing the Magician with the information necessary to
his strategical and tactical plans, in no wise enables him to accomplish
the impossible. It is not within the scope of divination to predict the
future (for example) with the certainty of an astronomer in calcuiating
the return of a cornet. 1 There is always much virtue in divination ;
for (Shakespeare assures us!) there is “much virtue in IF”!</p>
<p>In estimating the ultimate value of a divinatory judgment, one must
allow for more than the numerous sources of error inhérent</p>
<p>I. The astronomer himself has to enter a caveat. He can only
calculate the probability on the observed facts. Some force might
interfère with the anticipated movement.</p>
<p>— 167</p>
<p>in the process itself. The judgment can do no more than the facts
presented to it warrant. It is naturally impossible in most cases to
make sure that some important factor has not been omitted. In asking,
“shall I be wise to marry?” one leaves it open for wisdom to be defined
in divers ways. One can only expect an answer in the sense of the
question. The connotation of “wise” would then imply the limitations “in
your private définition of wisdom”, “in reference to your présent
circumstances.” It would not involve guarantee against subséquent
disaster, or pronounce a philosophical dictum as to wisdom in the
abstract sense. One must not assume tliat the oracle is omniscient. By
the nature of the case, on the contrary, it is the utterance of a being
whose powers are partial and limited, though not to such an extent, or
in the same directions, as one’s own. But a man who is advised to
purchase a certain stock should not complain if a general panic knocks
the bottom ont of it a few weeks later. The advice only referred to the
prospects of the stock in itself. The divination must not be blarned any
more than one would blâme a man for buying a house at Ypres three vears
before the World-War.</p>
<p>As against this, one must insist that it is obviously to the advan-
tage of the diviner to obtain this information from beings of the most
exalted essence available. An old witch who has a familiar spirit of
merely local celebritv such as the toad in her tree, can hardly expect
him to tell her much more of private matters than her parish magazine
does of public. It dépends entirely on the Magician how he is served.
The greater the man, the greater must be his teacher. It follows that
the highest forms of communicating daemons, those who know, so to speak,
the court secrets, disdain to concern themselves with matters which they
regard as beneath them. One must not make the mistake of calling in a
famous physician to one’s sick Pekinese. One must also beware of asking
even the cleverest angel a question outside his ambit. A heart
specialist should not prescribe for throat trouble.</p>
<p>The Magician ouglit therefore to make himself master of several
methods of divination; using one or the other as the purpose of the
moment dictâtes. He should make a point of organizing a staff of such
spiriis to suit varions</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>occasions. These shouid be “familiar” spirits, in the strict sense;
members of bis family. He shouid deal with them constantly, avoiding
whimsical or capricious changes. He shouid choose them so that their
capacities cover the whole ground of his workj but he shouid not
multiply them unneccessarily, for he makes himself responsible for each
one that he employs. Such spirits snould be ceremonially evoked to
visible or semi-visible appear- ance. A strict arrangement shouid be
made and sworn. This must be kept punctiliously by the Magician, and its
infringement by the spirit severely punished. Relations with these
spirits shouid be confirmed and encouraged by frequent intercourse. They
shouid be treated with courtesy, considération, and even affection. They
shouid be taught to love and respect their master, and to take pride in
being trusted by him.</p>
<p>It îs sometimes better to act on the advice of a spirit even when one
knows it to be wrong, though in such a case one must take the proper
précautions against an undesirable resuit. The reason for this is that
spirits of this type are very sensitive. They suffer agonies of remorse
on realising that they hâve injured their Master5 for he is their God;
they know themselves to be part of him, their aim is to attain to
absorption in him. They understand therefore that his interests are
theirs. Care must be taken to employ none but spirits who are fit for
the purpose, not only by reason of their capacity to supply information,
but for their sym- pathy with the personality of the Magician. Any
attempt to coerce unwilling spirits is dangerous. They obey from fear;
their fear makes them flatter, and tell amiable falsehoods. It also
créâtes phantasmal projections of themselves to personate them; and
these phantasms, besides being worthless, become the prey of malicious
daemons who use them to attack the Magician in various ways whose
prospect of success is enhanced by the fact that he has him¬ self
created a link with them.</p>
<p>One more observation seems désirable while on this subject.
Divination of any kind is improper in matters directly concerning the
Great Work itself. In the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy
Guardian Angel, the adept is possessed of ail he can possibly need. To
consult any other is to insnlt one’s</p>
<p>Angel. Moreover, it is to abandon the only person who really knows,
and really cares, in favour of one who by the nature of the case, must
be ignorant 1 of the essence of the matter — one whose interest in it is
no more (at the best) than that of a well- meaning stranger. It should
go without saying that until the Magician has attained to the Knowledge
and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel he is liable to endless
déceptions. He does not know Himself; how can he explain his business to
others ? How can those others, though they do their best for him, aid in
anything but tri fies ? One must therefore be prepared for dis-
appointment at every stage until one attains to adeptship.</p>
<p>This is especially true of divination, because the essence of the
horror of not knowing one’s Angel is the utter bewilderment and anguish
of the mind, complicated by the persécution of the body, and envenomed
by the ache of the soûl. One puts the wrong ques¬ tions, and puts them
wrong 3 gets the wrong answers, judges them wrong, and acts wrongly upon
them. One must nevertheless persist, aspiring with ardour towards one’s
Angel, and comforted</p>
<p>I. No intelligence of the type that opérâtes divination is a complété
Microscosm as Man is. He knows in perfection what lies within his own
Sphere, and little or nothing beyond it. Graphiel knows ail that is
know- able about Martial matters, as no Man can possibly do. For even
the most Martial man is limited as to Madim by the fact that Mars is
only one element in his molécule; the other éléments both inhibit
concentration on their colleague, and veil him by insisting on his being
interpreted in refer- ence to themselves. No entity whose structure does
not include the entire Tree of Life is capable of the Formulae of
Initiation. Graphiel, consulted by the Aspirants to Adeptship, would be
bound to regard the Great Work as purely a question of Combat, and
ignore ail other considérations. His advice wouid be absolute on
technical points of this kind; but its very perfection would persuade
the Aspirant to an unbalanced course of action which would entail
failure and destruction. It is pertinent to mention in this connection
that one must not expect absolute information as to what is going to
happen. “Fortune-telling” is an abuse of divination. At the utmost one
can only ascertain what may reasonably be expected. The proper function
of the process is to guide one’s judgrnent. Diagnosis is fairly
reliable; advice may be trusted, generally speaking; but prognosis
should always be cautious. The essence of the business is the
consultation of specialists.</p>
<p>y te assurance that He is guiding one secretly towards Himself,</p>
<p>and ihat ail one’s mistakes are necessary préparations for the</p>
<p>appointed hour of meeting Him. Each mistake is the combing-out</p>
<p>oi some tangle in the hair of the bride as she is being coiffed for
marriage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although the adept is in daily communica¬ tion
with his Angel, he ought to be careful to consult Him only on questions
proper to the dignity of the relation. One should not consult one s
Angel on too many details, or indeed on any matters vvhich corne within
the office of one’s familiar spirits. One does not to go the King about
petty personal trifles. The romance and rapture of the ineffable union
which consentes Adeptship must not be profaned by the introduction of
eommonplace cares. One must not appear with one’s hair in curl-papers,
or complain of the cook’s impertinence, if one wants to make the most of
the honeymoon. 1</p>
<p>To the Adept divination becomes therefore a secondary consid¬
ération, although he can now employ it with absolute confidence, and
probably use it with far greater frequency than before his attainment.
Indeed, this is likely in proportion as he learns that resort to
divination (on every occasion when his Will does not mstantly instruct
him) with implicit obedience to its counsels careless as to whether or
no they may land him in disaster, is a means admirably efficacious of
keeping his mind untroubled by external impressions, and therefore in
the proper condition to receive the réitérant strokes of rapture with
which the love of his Angel ravishes him.</p>
<p>We hâve now mapped out the boundaries of possibility and propnety
which define the physical and political geography of divination. The
student must guard himself constantly against supposing that this art
affords any absolute means of discovering “truth”, or indeed, of using
that Word as if it meant more than the</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>As the poet puts it; “Psyché, beware how thou disclose Thy tricks of
toilet to Eros, Or let him learn that those love-breathing Lyrical lins
that whisper, wreathing His brows with sense-bewitching gold, Are
equally</li>
</ol>
<p>expert to scold; 1 hat those caressing hands will maybe Yet box his
ears and slap the baby ! ”</p>
<p>relation of two ideas each of winch is itself as subject to
change</p>
<p>without notice” as a musical programme.</p>
<p>Divination, in the nature of things, can do no more than put the mind
of the querent into conscious connection with another mind whose
knowledge of the subject at issue is to bis own as that of an expert to
a layman. The expert is not infallible. 1 he client may put his question
in a misleading manner, or even base it on a completely erroneous
conception of the facts. He may misunder- stand the expert’s answer, and
he may misinterpret its purport. Apart from ail this, excluding ail
error, both question and answer are limited in validity by their own
conditions 3 and these conditions are such that truth may cease to be
true, either as time goes on, or if it be flawed by the defect of
failure to considei some circum- stances whose concealed operation
cancels the contract.</p>
<p>In a word, divination, like any other science, is justified of its
children. It would be extraordinary should so fertile a mother be immune
from still-births, monstrosities, and abomons.</p>
<p>We none of us dismiss our servant science with a kick and a curse
every time the téléphoné gets out of order. The téléphoné people make no
claim that it always Works and always Works right. 1 Divination, with
equal modesty, admits that «it often goes wrong; but it Works well
enough, ail thmgs considered. The science is in its infancy. Ail we can
do is our best. We no more prétend to infallibility than the mining
expert who considers himself in luck if he hits the bulPs eye four times
in ten.”</p>
<p>The error of ail dogmatists (from the oldest prophet with his
“literally-inspired word of God” to the newest German professor with his
single-track explanation of the Universe) lies in trying to prove too
much, in defending themselves against critics by stretch- ing a propably
excellent theorv to mclude ail the facts and th^ fables, until it bursts
like the overblown bladder it is.</p>
<p>Divination is no more than a rough and ready practical method which
we understand hardly at ail, and operate only as empincs. Success for
the best diviner alive is no more certain m any particular instance than
a long putt by a champion golfer. Its calculations</p>
<p>1 . Exce.pt in New York City.</p>
<p>— 172 —</p>
<p>are infinitely more complex than Chess, a Chess played on an infinité
boarci with men whose moves are indeterminate, and made still more
difficult by the interférence of impondérable forces and unformulated
laws; while its conduct demands not only the virtues, themselves rare
enough, of intellectual and moral integrity, but intuition combining
delicacy with strength in such perfection and to such extremes as to
make its existence appear monstrous and miraculous against Nature.</p>
<p>To admit this is not to discrédit oracles. On the contrary, the
oracles fell mto disrepute just because they pretended to do more than
they could. To divine concerning a matter is little more than to
calculate probabilities. We obtain the use of minds who hâve access ro
knowledge beyond ours, but not to omniscience. Hru ; the gréai angel set
over the Tarot, is beyond us as we are beyond the antj but, for ail we
know, the knowledge of Hru is excelled by some mightier mind in the same
proportion. Nor hâve we any warrant for accusing Hru of ignorance or
error if we read the Taroi to our own delusion. He may hâve known, he
may hâve spoken trulyj the fault may lie with our own insight. 1</p>
<p>The Master Therion has observed on innumerable occasions that
divinations, made by him and dismissed as giving untrue answers, hâve
justified themselves months or years later when he was able to revise
his judgment in perspective, untroubled by his Personal passion.</p>
<p>It is mdeed surprising how often the most careless divinations give
accurate answers. When things go wrong, it is almost always possible to
trace thæ error to one’s own self-willed and insolent presumption in
insisting that events shall accommodate themselves to our egoism and
vanity. It is comically unscientific to adduce</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The question of the sense in which an answer is true arises. One not
mix up the planes. Yet, as Mr. Russell shows, Of Cit. f. 61, the worlds
which lie behind phenomena must possess the same structure as our own.
Every proposition having a communicable significance must lie in just
that essence of individuality which, for that very reason, is irrelevant
to science , Just so : but this is to confess the impotence of science
to</li>
</ol>
<p>attam truth, and to admit the urgency of developing a mental
instrument of supenor capacity.</p>
<p>— x 73</p>
<p>examples of the mistakes of the diviners as evicience tîiat their ait
is fatuous. Every one knows that the simplest Chemical experi- ments
often go wrong. Every one knows the eccentricities of fountain pensj but
nobody outside Evangelical circles makes fun of the Cavendish
experiment, or asserts that, if fountain pens undoubtedly work now and
then, their doing so is mer ely coincidence.</p>
<p>The fact of the case is that the laws of nature are incomparably more
subtle than even science suspects. The phenomena of every plane are
intimately interwoven. The arguments of Aristotle were dépendent on the
atmospheric pressure which prevented his blood from boiling away. Tliere
is notiiing in the universe wliicli does not influence every otlier
thing in one way or another. There is no reason in Nature why the
apparently chance combinations of half-a-dozen sticks oï tortoise-shell
should not be so linked both with the human mind and with the entire
structure of the Universe that the observation of their fall should not
enable us to rneasure ail things in heaven and earth.</p>
<p>With one piece of curved glass we hâve discovered uncounted galaxies
of suns; with another, endless orders of existence in the infinitésimal.
With the prism we hâve analysed light so that matter and force hâve
become intelligible only as forms of light. With a rod we hâve summoned
the invisible energies of electricity to be our familiar spirit serving
us to do our Will, whether it be to outsoar the condor, or to dive
deeper into the démon world of disease than any of our dreamers dared to
dream.</p>
<p>Since with four bits of common glass mankind has learnt to know so
much, achieved so much, who dare deny that the Book of Thoth, the
quintessentialized wisdom of our ancestors whose civilizations, penshed
though they be, hâve left monuments which dwarf ours until we wonder
whether we are degenerate from them, or evolved from Simians, who dare
deny that such a book may be possessed of unimaginable powers?</p>
<p>It is not so long since the methods of modem science were scoffed at
by the whole cultured world. In the sacred halls themselves the roofs
rang loud with the scornful laughter of the high pnests as each new
postulant approached with his unorthodox offeiing.</p>
<p>174 —</p>
<p>There is hardly a scientific discovery in history which was not
decried as quackery by the very men whose own achievements were scarce
vet recognized by the world at large.</p>
<p>Within the memory of the présent génération, the possibility of
aéroplanes was derisively denied by those very engineers accounted most
expert to give their opinions.</p>
<p>The method of divination, the ratio of it, is as obscure to-day as
was that of spectrum analysis a génération ago. That the Chemical
composition of the fixed stars should become known to man seemed an
insane imagining too ridiculous to discuss. To-day it seems equally
irrational to enquire of the desert sand concerning the fate of empires.
Yet surely it, if any one knows, should know!</p>
<p>To-day it may Sound impossible for inanimate objects to reveal the
inmost secrets of mankind and nature. We cannot say whv divination is
valid. We cannot trace the process by which it per- forms its marvels. 1
But the same objections apply equally well to the téléphoné. No man
knows what electricity is, or the nature of the forces which détermine
its action. We know only that by doing certain things we get certain
results, and that the least error</p>
<p>I. The main différence between a Science and an Art is that the
former admits mensuration. Its processes must be susceptible of the
applica¬ tion of quantitative standards. Its laws reject impondérable
variables. Science despises Art for its refusai to conform with
calculable conditions. But even to-day, in the boasted Age of Science,
man is still dépendent on Art as to most matters of practical importance
to him; the Arts of Govern¬ ment, of War, of Literature, etc. are
supremely influential, and Science does little more than facilitate them
by making their materials mechanically docile. The utmost extension of
Science can merely organize the household of Art. Art thus progresses in
perception and power by increased control or automatic accuracy of its
details. The Master Therion has made an Epoch in the Art of Magick by
applying the Method of Science to its problems. His Work is a
contribution of unique value, comparable only to that of those men of
genius who revolutionized the empirical guess- work of “natural
philosophers”. The Magicians of to-morrow will be armed with
mathematical theory, organized observation, and experimentally- verified
practice. But their Art will remain inscrutable as ever in essence;
talent will never supplant genius. Education is impotent to produce a
poet greater than Robert Burns; the perfection of laboratory apparatus
préparé» indeed the path of a Pasteur, but cannot make masters of
mediocrities.</p>
<p>175 “</p>
<p>on our part will bring our work to naught. The same is exactly true
of divination. The différence between the two sciences is no more than
this : that, more minds having been at work on the former we hâve learnt
to master its tricks with greater success than in the case of the
latter.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
<p>OF DRAMATIC RITUALS</p>
<p>The Wheel turns to those effectuai methods of invocation employed in
the ancient Mysteries and bv certain secret bodies of initiâtes to-day.
The object of them is almost invariably 1 the invocation of a God, that
God conceived in a more or less material and personal fashion. These
Rituals are therefore well suited for such persons as are capable of
understanding the spirit of Magick as opposed to the letter. One of the
great advantages of them is that a large number of persons may take
part, so that there is consequently more force available; but it is
important that they should ail be initiâtes of the same mysteries, bound
by the same oaths, and filled with the same aspirations. They should be
associated only for this one purpose.</p>
<p>Such a company being prepared, the story of the God should be
dramatised by a well-skilled poet accustomed to this form of
composition. Lengthy speeches and invocations should be avoided, but
action should be very full. Such ceremonies should be care- fully
rehearsed; but in rehearsals care should be taken to omit the climax,
which should be studied by the principal character in private. The play
should be so arranged that this climax dépends on him alone. By this
means one prevents the ceremony from becoming mechanical or hackneyed,
and the element of surprise</p>
<p>I. The Word is unwarrantably universal. It would not be impractic-
able to adopt this method to such operations as Talismanic Magick. For
example, one might consecrate and charge a Pantacle by the communication
by AIWAZ to the Scribe of the BOOK :of the LAW, the Magician repre-
senting the Angel, the Pantacle being the Book, and the person on whom
the Pantacle is intended to act taking the part of the Scribe.</p>
<p>i n —</p>
<p>assists the lesser characters to get out of themselves at the suprême
moment. Following the climax there should always be an unre- hearsed
ceremony, an impromptu. The most satisfactory form of this is the dance.
In such ceremonies appropnate libations may be freely used.</p>
<p>The Rite of Luna (Equinox I. VI) is a good example of this use. .
Here the climax is the music of the goddess, the assistants remaining in
silent ecstasy.</p>
<p>In the rite of Jupiter the impromptu is the dance, in that of Saturn
long periods of silence.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that in these Rites poetry and music were large!y
employed mostly published pièces by well-known authois and composers. It
would be better 1 to Write and compose specially for the ceremony 2

recent times; the blood of a Christian being required for some purpose,
a young cock was procured and baptized into the Roman Catholic Church by
a man who, being the son of an ordained Priest, was magicaliy an
incarnation of the Being of that Priest, and was therefore congenitally
possessed of the powers thereto appurtenant. This cock, “Peter Paul,”
was consequently a baptized Christian for ail magical purposes. Order
was then taken to imprison the bird; which done, the Magicians assuming

</ol>
<p>moment, and its spontaneity and simplicity were presumably potent
factors in its success.</p>
<p>On the point of theology, I doubt whether Dom Gorenflot sucessfully
avoided eating méat in Lent by baptizing the pullet a carp. For as the
sacrament — by its intention, despite its defects of form — could not
fail of efficacy, the pullet must hâve become a Christian, and therefore
a human being. Carp was therefore only its baptized name — cf. Polycarp
— and Dom Gorenflot ate human flesh in Lent, so that, for ail he became
a bishop, he is damned.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX</p>
<p>OF THE EUCHARIST AND OF THE ART OF ALCHEMY</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>One of the simplest and most complété of Magick ceremonies is the
Eucharist.</p>
<p>It consists in taking common things, transmuting them into things
divine, and consuming them.</p>
<p>So far, it is a type of every magick ceremony, for the reabsorption
of the force is a kind of consumption; but it has a more restricted
application, as follows.</p>
<p>Take a substance 1 symbolic of the whole course of nature, make it
God, and consume it,</p>
<p>There are many ways of doing this; but they may easily be clas-
sifîed according to the number of the éléments of which the sacra- ment
is composed.</p>
<p>The highest form of the Eucharist is ihat in which the Elément
consecrated is One»</p>
<p>It is one substance and not two, not living and not dead, neither
liquid nor solid, neither bot nor cold, neither male nor female.</p>
<p>This sacrament is secret in every respect. For those who may be
worthy, although not officially recognized as such, this Eucharist has
been described in detail and without concealment, somewkere in the
published writings of the Master Therion. But He has told no one where.
It is reserved for the highest initiâtes, and is synonymous with the
Accomplished Work on the</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>This may be of a composite character.</li>
</ol>
<p>material plane. It is the Medicine of Metals, the Stone of the Wise,
the Potable Gold, the Elixir of Life that is consumed therein. The altar
is the hosom of Isis, the eteraal motlier ; the chalice is in effect the
Cnp of our Lady Bah al on lier self ; the Wand is that which Was and Is
and Is To Corne.</p>
<p>The Eucharist of two éléments has its matter of the passives, The
wafer (pantacle) is of corn, typical of earth; the wine (cup) represents
water. (There are certain other attributions. The Wafer is the Sun, for
instance : and the wine is appropriate to Bacchus).</p>
<p>The wafer may, however, be more complex, the “Cake of Light”
described in Liber Legis.</p>
<p>This is used in the exoteric Mass of the Phoenix (Liber 333, Cap:44)
mixed with the bloocl of the Magus. This mass should be performed daiJy
at snnset by every magician.</p>
<p>Corn and wine are équivalent to flesh and blood; but it is casier to
couvert live substances into the body and blood of God, than to perform
this miracle upon dead matter.</p>
<p>The Eucharist of three éléments has for basis the symbols of the
three Gunas. For Tamas (darkness) take opium or nightshade or some
sleepy medicine ; for Rajas (activity) take strychnine or ocher
excitant; for Sattvas (calm) the cakes of Light may again be suitable.
1</p>
<p>The Eucharist of jour éléments consists of fire, air, water, and
earth. These are represented by a flame for fire, by incense or roses
for air, by wine for water, and by bread and sait for earth.</p>
<p>The Eucharist of five éléments has for basis wine for taste, a rose
for smell, a flame for sight, a bell for sound, and a dagger for touch.
This sacrament is implied in the Mass of the Phoenix in a slightly
different form.</p>
<p>I. The Cakes of Light are universally applicable; they contain meal,
honey, and oil (carbohydrates, fats, and proteids, the three necessaries
of human nutrition) : also perfume of the three essential types of
magical and curative virtue; the subtle principle of animal life itself
is hxed in them by the introduction of fresh living blood.</p>
<p>The Eucharist of six éléments has Father, Son, and Holy Spirit above
j breath, water, and blood beneath. It is a sacrament reserved for high
initiâtes. 1 2</p>
<p>The Eucharist of seven éléments is mystically identical with that of
one.</p>
<p>Of the melhod of consecrating tlie éléments it is only necessary to
say that they should be treated as talismans.</p>
<p>The circle and other furniture of the Temple should receive the usual
benefit of the banishings and consécrations. The Oath should be taken
and the Invocations made. When the divine force mani- fests in the
éléments, they should be solemnly consumed. There is also a simpler
method of consécration reserved for initiâtes of high rank, of which it
is here unlawful to speak.</p>
<p>According to the nature of the Sacrament, so will its results be. In
some one may receive a mvstic grâce, culminating in Samadhi ; in others
a simpler and more material benefit may be obtained.</p>
<p>The highest sacrament, that of One elemenf, is universal in its
operation; according to the declared purpose of the work so will the
resuit be. It is a universal Key of ail Magick.</p>
<p>These secrets are of suprême practical importance, and are guarded in
the Sanctuary with a two-edged sword flaming every</p>
<p>way 2 y for this sacrament is the Tree of Life itself, and whoso
partaketh of the fruit thereof shall never die 3 .</p>
<p>Unless he so will. Who would not rather work through incarna¬ tion; a
real renewal of body and brain, than content himself with a stagnant
immortality upon this mote in the Sunlight of the Universe which we call
earth ?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Lance and the Graal are fïrstly dedicated to the Holy Spirit
of Life, in Silence. The Bread and Wine are then fermented and
manifested by vibration, and received by the Virgin Mother. The éléments
are then intermingled and consumed after the Epiphany of Iacchus, when
“Countenance beholdeth Countenance”.</p></li>
<li><p>J. K. Huysmans, who was afraid of them, and tried to betray the
little he knew of them, became a Papist, and died of cancer of the
tongue.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of the Elixir of Life is only justifiable in peculiar
circum- stances. To go counter to the course of natural Change is to
approximate perilously to the error of the “Black Brothers”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 1S1</p>
<p>With regard to the préparations for such Sacraments, the Catholic
Church has maintained well enough the traditions of the true Gnostic
Church in whose keeping the secrets are. 1</p>
<p>Chastity 2 is a condition; fastrng for sonie Iiours previons is a
condition; an carnest and continuai aspiration is a con¬ dition, Without
these antécédents even the Eucharist of the One and Seven is partiaily —
though such is its intrinsic virtue that it can never be wholly —
baulked of its effect.</p>
<p>A Eucharist of some sort sliould most assuredly be cou* summated
daily by every magician, and be sboitld regard if as the main sustenance
of bis magica! life, It is of more importance than any other magical
ceremony, because it is a complété circle. The whole of the force
expended is completely re-absorbed 3 yet the virtue is that vast gain
represented by the abyss between Man and God.</p>
<p>The magician becomes füled with God, fed upon God, intoxicaîed with
God. Lit lie by little Ms hody will bec orne pnrified by fbe internai
lustration of God; day by day bis mort ai frame, shedding its earihly
éléments, will become in very truth the Temple of tbe Holy Gliost. Day
by day matter is repîaeed by Spirit, tbe bmnau by the divine ;
ulîimately the change will be complété; God manifest in flesh will be
bis naine,</p>
<p>This is the most important of ail magical secrets that ever were or
are or can be. To a Magician thus renewed the attainment of the
Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel becomes an
inévitable task; every force of his nature, unhindered, tends to that
aim and goal of whose nature neither man nor god may speak, for that it
is infinitely beyond speech or thought or</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Study, in the Roman Missal, the Canon of the Mass, and the
chapter of “defects”.</p></li>
<li><p>The Word Chastity is used by initiâtes to signify a certain State
of soûl and of mind déterminant of a certain habit of body which is
nowise identical with what is commonly understood. Chastity in the true
magical sense of the word is inconceivable to those who are not wholly
emancipated from the obsession of sex.</p></li>

<p>ecstasy or silence. Samadhi and Nibbana are but its shadows cast upon
the universe.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>If the Master Therion effects by tliis book noihing else but to
demonstrate the continuily of nature and the uniformity of Law 5 He will
feel that Mis work bas not been wasted. In his original design of Part
III he did not contemplate any allusion to alchemy. It has somehow been
taken for granted that this subject is entirely foreign to regular
Magick, both in scope and method. It will be the main object of the
following descrip¬ tion to establish it as essentially a branch of the
subject, and to show that it may be considered simply as a particular
case of the general proposition — differing from evocatory and
talismanic Magick only in the values which are represented by the
unknown quantities in the pantomorphous équations.</p>
<p>There is no need to make any systematized attempt to decipher the
jargon of Hermetic treatises. We need not enter upon an historical
discussion. Let it suffice to say that the Word alchemy is an Arabie
term consisting of the article “al” and the adjective “khemi” which
means “that which pertains to Egypt” h A rough translation would be “The
Egyptian matter”. The assumption is that the Mohammedan grammarians held
traditionally that the art was derived from that wisdom of the Egyptians
which was the boast of Moses, Plato, and Pythagoras, and the source of
their illumination.</p>
<p>Modem research (by profane scholars) leaves it still doubtful as to
whether Alchemical treatises should be classified as mystical, magical,
medical, or Chemical. The most reasonable opinion is that ail these
objects formed the pre-occupation of the alchemists in varying
proportions. Hermes is alike the God of Wisdom, Thau- maturgy,
therapeutics, and physical science. Ail these may con- sequently claim
the title Hermetic. It cannot be doubted that such writers as Fludd
aspired to spiritual perfection. It is equally sure that Edward Kelly
wrote primarily from the point of view</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>This etymology differs from that given by Skeat; I can do no more
than présent my submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>of a Magician; that Paracelesus applied himself to the cure of
disease and the prolongation of life as the first considération, ai-
though his greatest achievements seem to modem thinkers to hâve been
ratifier his discoveries of opium, zinc, and hydrogen; so that we tend
to think of him as a chemist no less than we do of Van Helmont, whose
conception of gas ranks him as one of those rare geniuses who hâve
increased human knowledge by a fundamentally important idea.</p>
<p>The literature of Alchemy is immense. Practicaliy ail of it is wholly
or partially unintelligible. Its treatises, from the a Asch Metzareph”
of the Hebrews to the “Chariot of Antimony” are deliberately couched in
hieratic riddles. Ecclesiastical persécution, and the profanation of the
secrets of power, were equally dreaded. Worse still, from our point of
view, this motive induced writers to insert intentionally misleading
statements, the more deeply to bedevil unworthy pretenders to their
mysteries.</p>
<p>We do not propose to discuss any of the actual processes. Most
readers will be already aware that the main objects of alchemy were the
Philosopheras Stone, the Medicine of Metals, and varions tinctures and
élixirs possessing divers virtues; in particular, those of healing
disease, extending the span of life, increasing human abilities,
perfecting the nature of man in every respect, conferring magical
powers, and transmuting material substances, especially metals, into
more valuable forms.</p>
<p>The subject is further complicated by the fact that many authors were
unscrupulous quacks. Ignorant of the first éléments of the art, they
plagiarized without shame, and reaped a harvest of fraudulent gain. They
took advantage of the general ignorance, and the convention of mystery,
in just the same way as their modem successors do in the matter of ail
Occult sciences.</p>
<p>But despite all.this, one thing is abundantly clear; ail serious
writers, though they seem to speak of an infinity of different subjects,
so much so that it has proved impossible for modem analytic research to
ascertain the true nature of any single process, were agreed on the
fundamental theory on which they based their practices. It appears at
first sight as if hardly any two of them were in accord as to the nature
of the “First Matter of the Work”.</p>
<p>— 184</p>
<p>They describe this in a bewildering multiplicity of unintelligible
symbols. We hâve no reason to suppose that they were ail talking of the
same thing, or otherwise. The same remarks apply to every reagent and
every process, no less than to the final product or products.</p>
<p>Yet beneath this diversity, we may perceive an obscure identity. They
ail begin with a substance in nature which is described as existing
almost everywhere, and as universally esteemed of no value. The
alchemist is in ail cases to take this substance, and subject it to a
sériés of operations. By so doing, he obtains his product, This product,
however named or described, is always a substance which represents the
truth or perfection of the original “First Matter”; and its qualities
are invariably such as pertain to a living being, not to an inanimate
mass. In a Word, the alchemist is to take a dead thing, impure,
valueless, and powerless, and transform it into a live thing, active,
invaluable and thaumaturgie.</p>
<p>The reader of this book will surely find in this a most striking
analogy with what we hâve already said of the processes of Magick. What,
by our définition, is initiation ? The First Matter is a man, that is to
say, a perishable parasite, bred of the earth’s crust, crawl- ing
irritably upon it for a span, and at last returning to the dirt whence
he sprang. The process of initiation consists in removing his
impurities, and finding in his true self an immortal intelligence to
whom matter is no more than the means of manifestation. The initiate is
eternally individual; he is ineffable, incorruptible, im¬ mune from
everything. He possesses infinité wisdom and infinité power in himself.
This équation is identical with that of a talisman. The Magician takes
an idea, purifies it, intensifies it by invoking into it the inspiration
of his soûl. It is no longer a scrawl scratched on a sheep-skin, but a w
T ord of Truth, imperish- able, mighty to prevail throughout the sphere
of its purport. The évocation of a spirit is precisely similar in
essence. The exorcist takes dead material substances of a nature
sympathetic to the being whom he intends to invoke. He banishes ail
impurities there- fiom, prevents ail interférence therewith, and
proceeds to give life to the subtle substance thus prepared by
instilling his soûl.</p>
<ul>
<li>185 -</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, there is nothing in this exclusively FnagicaP. Rem¬
brandt Van Ryn used to take a number of ores and other crude objects.
From these he banished the impurities, and consecrated them to his work,
by the préparation of canvasses, brushes, and colours. This done, he
compelled them to take the stamp of his soûl ; from those dull,
valueless créatures of earth he created a vital and powerful being of
truth and beauty. It would indeed be surprising to anybody who lias
corne to a clear compréhension of nature if there were any différence in
the essence of these various formulas. The laws of nature apply equally
in every possible circumstance.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to nnderstand wliat alcliemy is. We miglit
even go further and say tliat even if we liad ne ver lieard of it, we
know wliat it mu si be.</p>
<p>Let us emphasize the fact that the final product is in ail cases a
living thing. It has been the great stumbling block to modem research
that the statements of alchemists cannot be explained away, From the
Chemical standpoint it has seemed not à ’priori impossible that lead
should be turned into gold. Our recent discovery of the periodicity of
the éléments has made it seem likely, at least in theory, that our
apparently immutable éléments should be modi¬ fications of a single one.
1 Organic Chemistry, with its metatheses and synthèses dépendent on the
conceptions of molécules as geomet- rical structures has demonstrated a
praxis which gives this theory body; and the properties of Radium hâve
driven the Old Guard from the redoubt which flew the flag of the
essential heterogeneity of the éléments. The doctrines of Evolution hâve
brought the alchemical and monistic theory of matter into line with our
conception of life ; the collapse of the wall between the animal and
vegetable kingdoms has shaken that which divided them from the
minerai.</p>
<p>But even though the advanced chemist might admit the possibi- lity of
transmuting lead into gold, he could not conceive of that</p>
<p>I. See R. K. Duncan, “The New Knowledge”, for a popularisation of
recent results.</p>
<p>Aleister Crowley held this doctrine in his teens at a period when it
was the grossest heresy.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>gold as other than metallic, of the same order of nature as the lead
from which it had been made. That this gold should possess the power of
multiplying itself, or of acting as a ferment upon other substances,
seemed so absurd that he felt obliged to conclude that the alchemists
who claimed these properties for their Gold must, after ail, hâve been
referring not to Chemistry, but to some spiritual operations whose
sanctity demanded some such symbolic veil as the cryptographie use of
the language of the laboratory.</p>
<p>The Master Therion is sanguine that his présent réduction of ail
cases of the art of Magick to a single formula will both elucidate and
vindicate Alchemy, while extending chemistry to cover ail classes of
Change.</p>
<p>There is an obvious condition which limits our proposed operations.
This is that, as the formula of any Work eflfects the extraction and
visualization of the Truth from any “First Matter”, the “Stone” or
“Elixir” which results from our labours will be the pure and perfect
Individual originally inhérent in the substance chosen, and nothing
else. The most skilful gardener cannot produce lilies from the wild
rose; his roses will always be roses, however he hâve perfected the
properties of his stock.</p>
<p>There is here no contradiction with our previous thesis of the
ultimate unity of ail substance. It is true that Hobbs and Nobbs are
both modifications of the Pleroma. Both vanish in the Pleroma when they
attain Samadhi. But they are not interchangeable to the extent that they
are individual modifications ; the initiate Hobbs is not the initiate
Nobbs any more than Hobbs the haberdasher is Nobbs of “the nail and
sarspan business as he got his money by”. Our skill in producing aniline
dyes does not enable us to dispense with the original aniline, and use
sugar instead. Thus the Alchemists said : “To make gold you must take
gold”; their art was to bring each substance to the perfection of its
own proper nature.</p>
<p>No doubt, part of this process involved the withdrawal of the essence
of the “First Matter” within the homogeneity of “Hyle”, just as
initiation insists on the annihilation of the individual in the
Impersonal Infinity of Existence to emerge once more as a less confused
and deformed Eidolon of the Truth of Himself. This is the guarantee that
he is uncontaminated by alien éléments. The</p>
<p>187 -</p>
<p>“Elixir” must possess the activity of a “nascent” substance, just as
“nascent” hydrogen combines with arsenic (in “Marsh’s test”) when the
ordinary form of the gas is inert. Again, oxygen satisfied by sodium or
diluted by nitrogen will not attack combustible materials with the
vehemence proper to the pure gas.</p>
<p>We may summarize this thesis by sayîng that Àlcîiemy includes as many
possible operations as tliere are original ideas inberent in nature.</p>
<p>Alchemy resembles évocation in its sélection of appropriate material
bases for the manifestation of the Will5 but differs from it in
proceeding without personification, or the intervention of alien planes.
1 It may be more closely compared with Initiation; for the effective
element of the Product is of the essence of its own nature, and inhérent
therein; the Work similarly consists in isolating it from its
accretions.</p>
<p>Now just as the Aspirant, on the Threshold of Initiation, finds
himself assailed by the “complexes” which hâve corrupted him, their
externalization excruciating him, and his agonized réluctance to their
élimination plunging him into such ordeals that he seems (both to
himself and to others) to hâve turned from a noble and upright man into
an unutterable scoundrel ; so does the First Matter blacken and putrefy
as the Alchemist breaks up its coagu¬ lations of impurity.</p>
<p>The student may work out for himself the varions analogies involved,
and discover the “Black Dragon”, the “Green Lion”, the “Lunar Water”,
the “Raven’s Head”, and so forth. The indi¬ cations above given should
suffice ail who possess aptitude for Alchemical Research.</p>
<p>Only one further reflection appears necessary; namely, that the
Eucharist, with which this chapter is properly preoccupied, must be
conceived as one case — as the critical case — of the Art of the
Alchemist.</p>
<p>The reader will hâve observed, perhaps with surprise, that The Master
Therion describes several types of Eucharist. The reason is that given
above; there is no substance incompetent to</p>
<p>I. Some alchemists may object to this statement. I prefer to express
no final opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>— 188</p>
<p>serve as an element in some Sacrament; also, each spiritual Grâce
should possess its peculiar form of Mass, and therefore its own “materia
magica 77 . It is utterly unscientific to treat “God 77 as a universal
homogeneity, and use the same means to prolong life as to bewitch
cattle. One does not invoke “Electricity 77 indiscrimi- nately to light
one 7 s house and to propel one’s brougham; one Works by measured
application of one 7 s powers to intelligent analytical compréhension of
the conditions of each separate case.</p>
<p>There is a Eucharist for every Grâce that we may need; we must
apprehend the essential characters in each case, select suitable
Eléments, and devise proper processes.</p>
<p>To consider the classical problems of Alchemy: the Medicine of Metals
must be the quintessence of some substance that serves to détermine the
structure (or rate of vibration) whose manifestation is in
characteristic metallic qualities. This need not be a Chemical substance
at ail in the ordinary sense of the Word.</p>
<p>The Elixir of Life will similarly consist of a living organism
capable of growth, at the expense of its environment ; and of such a
nature that its “true Will 75 is to cause that environment to serve it
as its means of expression in the physical world of human life.</p>
<p>The Universal Medicine will be a menstruum of such subtlety as to be
able to penetrate ail matter and transmute it in the sense of its own
tendency, while of such impartial purity as to accept perfectly the
impression of the Will of the Alchemist. This substance, properly
prepared, and properly charged, is able to perform ail things soever
that are physically possible, within the limits of the proportions of
its momentum to the inertia of the object to which it is applied.</p>
<p>It may be observed in conclusion that, in dealing with forms of
Matter-Motion so subtle as these, it is not enough to pass the Pons
Asinorum of intellectual knowledge.</p>
<p>The Master Therion has possessed the theory of these Powers for many
years; but Elis practice is still in progress towards perfection. Even
efficiency in the préparation is not ail; there is need to be judicious
in the manipulation, and adroit in the admi¬ nistration, of the product.
Ele does not perform haphazard miracles, but applies His science and
skill in conformity with the laws of nature.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXI</p>
<p>OF BLACK MAGIC</p>
<p>OF THE MAIN TYPES OF THE OPERATIONS OF MAGICK ART AND OF THE POWERS
OF THE SPHINX</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>As was said at the opening of the second chapter, the Single Suprême
Ritual is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conver¬ sation of the Holy
Guardian Angel. It is the raisin g of the complété man in a vertical
straight line.</p>
<p>Any déviation from tliis line tends to become black magic. Any otlier
operation is black magic.</p>
<p>In the True Operation the Exaltation is equilibrated by an expansion
in the other three arms of the Cross. Hence the Angel immediately gives
the Adept power over the Four Great Princes and their servitors. 1</p>
<p>If the magician needs to perform any other operation than this, it is
only lawful in so far as it is a necessary preliminary to That One
Work.</p>
<p>There are, however many shades of grey. It is not every magician who
is well armed with theory. Perhaps one such may invoke Jupiter, with the
wish to heal others of their physical ills. This sort of thing is
harmless, 2 or almost so. It is not evil in</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See the Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.</p></li>
<li><p>There is nevertheless the general objection to the diversion of
channels of Initiation to the Sea of Attainment, into ditches of
irrigation for the fields of material advantage. It is bad business to
pay good coin for perishable products; like marrying for money, or
prostituting poetic genius to political purposes. The converse course,
though equally</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 190</p>
<p>itself. It anses from a defect of understanding. Until tlie Great
Work lias been performed, it is presumptuous for the magician to prétend
to understand the universe, and dictate its policy. Only the Master of
the Temple can say whether</p>
<p>any given act is a crime. “Slay that innocent child?” (I hear the
ignorant say) “What a horror!” “Ah!” replies the Knower, with foresight
of history, “but that child will become Nero. Hasten to strangle
him!”</p>
<p>lhere is a third, above these, who understands that Nero was as
necessary as Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>The Master of the Temple accordingly interfères not with the scheme
of things except just so far as he is doing the Work which he is sent to
do. Why should he struggle against imprisonment, banishment, death? It
is ail part of the game in which he is a pawn. “It was necessary for the
Son of Man to suffer these things, and to enter into His glory.”</p>
<p>The Master of the Temple is so far from the man in whom He manifests
that ail these matters are of no importance to Him. It may be of
importance to His Work that man shall sit upon a throne, or be hanged.
In such a case He informs his Magus, who exerts the power intrusted to
Him, and it happens accord¬ ingly. Yet ail happens naturally, and of
necessity, and to ail appearance without a Word from Him.</p>
<p>Nor will the mere Master of the Temple, as a rule, présumé to act
upon the Universe, save as the servant of his own destiny. It is only
the Magus, He of the grade above, who has attained to Chokhmah, Wisdom,
and so dare act. He must dare act, although iî like Him not. But He must
assume the Curse of His grade, as it is written in the Book of the
Magus. * 1</p>
<p>There are, of course, entirely black forms of magic. To him who has
not given every drop of his blood for the cup of Babalon</p>
<p>objectionable as pollution of the purity of the planes, is at least
respectable for its nobility. The ascetic of the Thebaid or the Trappist
Monastery is infinitely worthier than the health-peddler and
success-monger of Boston or Los Angeles; for the one offers temporal
trash to gain eternal wealth, while the other values spiritual substance
only as enabling him to get better bodily conditions, and a hrmer grip
on the dollars.</p>
<p>I. Equinox I, VII, 5-9.</p>
<p>ail magic power is dangerous. There are even more debased and evil
forms, things in themselves black. Such is the use of spiritual force to
material ends. Christian Scientists, Mental Healers, Professional
Diviners, Psychics and the like, are ail ipso facto Black M agi ci
ans.</p>
<p>Thev exchange gold for dross. They sell their higher powers for gross
and temporary benefit.</p>
<p>That the most crass ignorance of Magick is their principal
characteristic is no excuse, even if Nature accepted excuses, which she
does not. If you drink poison in mistake for wine, your “mistake” will
not save your life.</p>
<p>Below these in one sense, yet far above them in another, are the
Brothers of the Left Hand Path L These are they who “shut themselves
up”, who refuse their blood to the Cup, who hâve trampled Love in the
Race for self-aggrandisement.</p>
<p>As far as the grade of Exempt Adept, they are en the same path as the
White Brotherhood; for until that grade is attained, the goal is not
disclosed. Then only are the goats, the lonely leaping mountain-masters,
separated from the gregarious huddling vallev-bound sheep. Then those
who hâve well learned the lessons of the Path are ready to be torn
asunder, to givc up their own life to the Babe of the Abyss which is —
and is not — they.</p>
<p>The others, proud in their purple, refuse. They make themselves a
false crown of the Horror of the Abyss ; they set the Dispersion of
Choronzon upon their brows; they clothe themselves in the poisoned robes
of Form; they shut themselves up; and when the force that made them what
they are is exhausted, their strong towers fail, they become the Eaters
of Dung in the Day of Be- with-us, and their shreds, strewn in the
Abyss, are lost.</p>
<p>Not so the Masters of the Temple, that sit as piles of dust in the
City of the Pyramids, awaiting the Great Flame that shall consume that
dust to ashes. For the blood that they hâve surren- dered is treasured
in the Cup of our Lady Babalon, a mighty</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of Black Magic, one may touch lightly on
the question of Pacts with the Devil.</p>
<p>The Devil tloes not exist. It is a false name invenîed by tlie Black
Brothers to imply a Unity in tlieir ignorant muddle of dispersions» A
devil who liad unity would be a God L .</p>
<p>It was said by the Sorcerer of the Jura that in order to invoke the
Devil it is only necessary to caîl him with y our whole</p>
<p>will.</p>
<p>This is an universal magical truth, and applies to every other being
as much as to the Devil. For the whole will of every man is in reality
the whole will of the Uni verse.</p>
<p>It is, however, always easy to call up the démons, for they are
always calling you; and you hâve only to step down to their level</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>“The Devil” is, historically, the God of any people that one
personally dislikes. This has led to so much confusion of thought that
The Beast 666 has preferred to let names stand as they are, and to
proclaim simply that Aiwaz — the solar-phallic-hermetic “Lucifer” is His
own Holy Guardian Angel, and “The Devil” Satan or Hadit of our
particular unit of the Starry Universe. This serpent, Satan, is not the
enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil;
He bade “Know Thyself!” and taught Initiation. He is “the Devil” of the
Book of Thoth, and His emblem is Baphomet, the Androgyne who is the
hieroglyph of arcane perfection. The number of His Atu is xv, which is
Yod Hé, the Monogram of the Eternal, the Father one with the Mother, the
Virgin Seed one with all-containing Space. He is therefore Life, and
Love. But moreover his letter is Ayin, the Eye; he is Light, and his
Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat whose attribute is
Liberty. (Note that the “Jéhovah” of the Hebrews is etymologically
connected with these. The classical example of such antinomy, one which
has led to such disastrous misunderstandings, is that between Nu and
HAD,North and South, Jésus and John. The subject is too abstruse and
complicated to be discussed in detail here. The student shouîd consult
the writings of Sir R. Payne Knight, General Forlong, Gerald Massey,
Fabre d’Olivet; etc. etc., for the data on which these considérations
are ultimately based.)</li>

<p>and fraternize with them. They will then tear you in pièces at their
leisure. Not at once 3 they will wait until you hâve wholly broken the
link between you and your Holy Guardian Angel before they pounce, lest
at the last moment you escape.</p>
<p>Antony of Padua and (in our own times) “Macgregor” Mathers are
examples of such victims.</p>
<p>Neverthless, every magician must firmly extend his empire to the
depth of hell. a My adepts stand upright, their heads above the heavens,
their feet below the hells.” 1</p>
<p>This is the reason why the magician who performs the Operation of the
“Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage”, immediately after attaining to the
Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, must evoke the
Four Great Princes of the Évil of the World.</p>
<p>“Obedience and faith to Him that liveth and triumpheth, that reigneth
above yon in your palaces as the Balance of Righteousness and Truth” is
your duty to your Holy Guar¬ dian Angel, and the duty of the démon world
to you.</p>
<p>These powers of “evil” nature are wild beasts; they must be tamed,
trained to the saddle and the bridle; they will bear you well. There is
nothing useless in the Universe: do not wrap up your Talent in a napkin,
because it is only “dirty money”!</p>
<p>With regard to Pacts, they are rarely lawful. There should be no
bargain struck. Magick is not a trade, and no hucksters need apply.
Master everything, but give generouslv to your servants, once they hâve
unconditionally submitted.</p>
<p>There is also the question of alliances with various Powers. These
again are hardly ever allowable. 2 No Power which is not</p>

in whose ranks are not only angelic forces, but elementals, and even

that they hâve banded themselves together with the object of becoming
Microcosms, and realize that their best means to this end is dévotion to
the service of the true interests of Mankind. Societies of spiritual
forces, organized on these lines, dispose of enormous resources. The
Magician who is himself sworn to the service of humanity may count upon
the heartiest help of these Orders. Their sincerity may always be
assured by putting them to the</p></li>

<p>a microcosm in itself — and even archangels reach rarely to this
centre of balance — is fit to treat on an equality with Man. The proper
study of mankind is God; with Him is his business; and with Him alone.
Some magicians hâve hired légions of spirits for some spécial purpose;
but it has always proved a serious mistake. The whole idea of exchange
is foreign to magick. The dignity of the magician forbids compacts. “The
Earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof”.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The operations of Magick art are difficult to classify, as they merge
into each other, owing to the essential unity of their method and
resuit. We may mention :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Operations such as évocation, in which a live spirit is brought
from dead matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Consécrations of talismans in which a live spirit is bound înto
“dead” matter and vivifies the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Works of divination, in which a live spirit is made to control
operations of the hand or brain of the Magician. Such works are
accordingly most dangerous, to be used only by advanced magicians, and
then with great care.</p></li>
<li><p>Works of fascination, such as operations of invisibility, and
transformations of the apparent form of the person or thing concerned.
This consists almost altogether in distracting the attention, or
disturbing the judgment, of the person whom it is wished to deceive.
There are, however, “real” transformations of the adept himself which
are very useful. See the Book of the Dead for methods. The assumption of
God-Forms can be carried to the point of actual transformation.</p></li>
<li><p>Works of Love and Hâte, which are also performed (as</p></li>
</ol>
<p>test of the acceptance of the Law of Thelema. Whoso déniés “Do what
thou wilt shall be the Whole of the Law” confesses that he still clings
to the conflict in his own nature; he is not, and does not want to be,
true to himself. A fortiori , he will prove false to you.</p>
<p>— 195 —</p>
<p>a rule) by a fascination. These Works are too easy 3 and rarely
useful. They hâve a nasty trick of recoiling on the magician.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Works of destruction, which may be done in many different ways. One
may fascinate and bend to one’s will a person who has of his own right
the power to destroy. One may employ spirits or talismans. The more
powerful magicians of the last few centuries hâve employed books.</li>
</ol>
<p>In private matters these Works are very easy, if they be neces- sary.
An adept known to The Master Therion once found it necessary to slay a
Circe who was bewitching brethren. He merely walked to the door of her
room, and drew an Astral T (“tradi- tore”, and the symbol of Saturn)
with an astral dagger. Within 48 h ours she shot herself. 1</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Works of création and dissolution, and the higher invoca¬
tions.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also hundreds of other operations 3 2 to bring wanted
objects — gold, books, women and the like; to open locked doors, to
discover treasure; to swim under water3 to hâve armed nen at command —
etc., etc. Ail these are really matters of detail 3 the Adeptus Major
will easily understand how to perform them if necessary. 3</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As explained above, in another connexion, he who’ “destroys” any
being must accept it, with ail the responsibilities attached, as part of
himself. The Adept here in question was therefore obliged to incorporate
the elemental spirit of the girl — she was not human, the sheath of a
Star, but an advanced planetary daemon, whose rash ambition had captured
a body beyond its capacity -to conduct — in his own magical vehicîe. He
thereby pledged himself to subordinate ail the sudden accession of
qualities — pas- sionate, capricious, impulsive, irrational, selfish,
short-sightedness, sensual, fickle, crazy, and desperate, to his True
Will; to discipline, co-ordinate, and employ them in the Great Work,
under the penalty of being torn asunder by the wild horses which he had
bound fast to his own body by the act of “destroying” their independent
consciousness and control of their</li>
</ol>
<p>chosen vehicle. See His Magical Record An XX, Q in bb and onward.</p>

<p>lt should be added that ail these things happen “naturally”. 1
Perform an operation to bring Gold — your rich uncle dies and leaves you
his moneyj books — you see the book wanted in a catalogue that very day,
although you hâve advertised in vain for a year; woman — but if you hâve
made the spirits bring you enough gold, this operation will become
unnecessary. 2</p>
<p>It must further be remarked that it is absolute Black Magic to use
any of these powers if the object can possibly be otherwise attained. If
your child is drowning, you must jump and try to save him; it won’t do
to invoke the Undines.</p>
<p>Nor is it lawful in ail circumstances to invoke those Undines even
where the case is hopeless; maybe it is necessary to ycu and to the
child that it should die. An Exempt Adept on the right road will make no
error here — an Adept Major is only too likely to do so. A through
appréhension of this book will arm adepts of every grade against ail the
more serious blunders incidental to their unfortunate positions.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Necromancy is of sufficient importance to demand a section to
itself.</p>
<p>It is justifiable in some exceptional cases. Suppose the magician
fail to obtain. access to living Teachers, or should he need some</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The value of the evidence that your operations hâve influenced the
course of events is only to be assessed by the application of the Laws
of probability. The Master Therion would not accept any one single case
as conclusive, however improbable it might be. A man might make a
correct guess at one chance in ten million, no less than at one in
three. If one pick up a pebble, the chance was infinitely great against
that particular pebble; yet whichever one was chosen, the same chance
“came off”. It requires a sériés of events antecedently unlikely to
deduce that design is a work, that the observed changes are causally,
not casually, produced. The prédiction of events is further evidence
that they are effected by will. Thus, any man may fluke a ten shot at
billiard, or even make a break of a few strokes. But chance cannot
account for consistent success, even if moderate, when it extends over a
long period of time. And the ability of the expert to “name his shot”
manifests a knowledge of the relations of cause and effect which
confirms the testimony of his empirical skill that his success is not
chance and coincidence.</li>

<p>especial piece of knowledge which he has reason to believe died with
some teacher of the past, it may be useful to evoke the “shade” of such
a one, or read the “Akasic record” of his mind. 1</p>
<p>If this be done it must be done properly very much on the lines of
the évocation of Apollonius of Tyana, which Eliphaz Levi performed.
2</p>
<p>The utmost care must be taken to prevent personation of the “shade”.
It is of course easy, but can rarely be advisable, to evoke the shade of
a suicide, or of one violently slain or suddenly dead.</p>
<p>Of what use is such an operation, save to gratify curiosity or vanity
?</p>
<p>One must add a Word on spiritism, which is a sort of indiscrimi- nate
necromancy — one might prefer the word necrophilia — by amateurs. They
make themselves perfectly passive, and, so far from employing any
methods of protection, deliberately invite ail and sundrv spirits,
démons, shells of the dead, ail the excre- ment and filth of earth and
hell, to squirt their slime over them. This invitation is readily
accepted, unless a clean man be présent</p>
<p>with an aura good enough to frighten these foui denizens of the
pit.</p>
<p>No spiritualistic manifestation has ever taken place in the</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The only minds likeîy to be useful to the Magician belong to Adepts
sworn to suffer reincarnation at short intervals, and the best éléments
of such minds are bound up in the “Unconscious Self” of the Adept, not
left to wandei idly about the Astral Plane. It will thus be more
profitable to try to get into touch with the “Dead Teacher” in his
présent avatar. Moreover, Adepts are at pains to record their teachings
in books, monu¬ ments, or pictures, and to appoint spiritual guardians
to preserve such heirlooms throughout the générations. Whenever these
are destroyed or lost, the reason usually is that the Adept himself
judges that their usefulness is over, and withdraws the forces which
protected them. The student is therefore advised to acquiesce; the
sources of information available for him aie probably selected by the
Wardens of Mankind with a view to his real necessities. One must learn
to trust one’s Holy Guardian Angel to shape one’s circumstances with
skill. If one be but absorbed in the ardour of one’s aspiration toward
Him, short indeed is the time before Expérience instils the certain
conviction that His Works and His ways are inhnitely apt to one’s
needs.</li>

<p>presence even of Frater Perdurabo; how much less in that of The
Master Therion ! 1</p>
<p>Of ail the créatures He ever met, the most prominent of English
spiritists (a journalist and pacifist of more than European famé) had
the filthiest mind and the foulest mouth. He would break off any
conversation to tell a stupid smutty story, and could hardi y conceive
of any society assembling for any other purpose than “phallic orgies 7
’, whatever they may be. Utterly incapable of keeping to a subject, he
would drag the conversation down again and again to the sole subject of
which he really thought — sex and sex-perversions and sex and sex and
sex and sex again,</p>
<p>This was the plain resuit of his spiritism. Ail spiritists are more
or less similarly afflicted. They feel dirty even across the Street j
their auras are ragged, muddy and malodorous; they ooze the slime of
putrefying coprses.</p>
<p>No spiritist, once he is wholly enmeshed in sentimentality and
Freudian fear-phantasms, is capable of concentrated thought, of
persistent will, or of moral character. Devoid of every spark of the
divine light which was his birthright, a prey before death to the
ghastly tenants of the grave, the wretch, like the mesmerized and living
corpse of Poe’s Monsieur Valdemar, is a “nearly liquid mass of
loathsome, of détestable putrescence.”</p>
<p>The student of this Holy Magick is most earnestly warned against
frequenting their séances, or even admitting them to his presence.</p>
<p>They are contagious as Syphilis, and more deadly and disgus-</p>
<p>ting. Unless your aura is strong enough to inhibit any manifestation
of the loatïily iarvae that hâve taken up their habitation in them, shun
them as you need not mere lepers! 2 * * *</p>

felt by D. D. Home for Eliphas Levi. See Equinox I, X, “The Key of the

personal</p>

only</p>
<p>intelligent and beneficent entities. Such persons may perhaps

<p>V</p>
<p>Of the powers of the Sphinx much has been written. * 1 Wisely they
hâve been kept in the forefront of true magical instruction. Even the
tyro can always rattle off that he has to know, to dare to will and to
keep silence. It is difficult to Write on this subject, for these powers
are indeed comprehensive, and the interplay of one with the other
becomes increasingly évident as one goes more deeply into the
subject.</p>
<p>But there is one general principle which seems worthy of spécial
emphasis in this place. These four powers are thus complex because they
are the powers of the Sphinx, that is, they are func- tions of a single
organism.</p>
<p>Now those who understand the growth of organisms are aware that
évolution dépends on adaptation to environment. If an animal which
cannot swim is occasionally thrown into water, it may escape by some
piece of good fortune, but if it is thrown into water continuously it
will drown sooner or later, unless it learns to swim.</p>
<p>Organisms being to a certain extent elastic, they soon adapt
themselves to a new environment, provided that the change is not so
sudden as to destroy that elasticity.</p>
<p>Now a change in environment involves a repeated meeting of new
conditions, and if you want to adapt yourself to any given set of
conditions, the best thing you can do is to place yourself cautiously
and persistently among them. That is the foundation of ail
éducation.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned pédagogues were not ail so stupid as some modem
educators wx&gt;uld hâve us think. The principle of the System was to
strike the brain a sériés of constantly repeated blows until the proper
reaction became normal to the organism.</p>
<p>It is not désirable to use ideas which excite interest, or may
corne</p>
<p>spiritualism without ohvious bad results, and even with good results,
within limits. But such exceptions in no wise invalidate the general
rule, or in any way serve as argument against the magical theory
outlined above with such mild suasion.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>In Liber CXI (Aleph) the subject is treated with profound and all-
comprehensive wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<p>200</p>
<p>in handy later as weapons, in this fundamental training of the mind.
It îs much better to compel the mind to busy itself with root ideas
which do not mean very much to the child, because you are not trying to
excite the brain, but to drill it. For this reason, ail the hest mincis
liave been trained by preliminary study of classics and mathematics.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the training of the body. The original
exercises should be of a character to train the muscles generally to
perform any kind or work, rather than to train them for some spécial
kind of work, concentration on which will unfit them for other tasks by
depriving them of the elasticity which is the proper condition of life.
1</p>
<p>In Magick and méditation this principle applies with tremend- ous
force. It is quite useless to teach people how to perform magical
operations, when it may be that such operations, when thev hâve learned
to do them, are not in accordance with their wills. What must be done is
to drill the Aspirant in the hard routine of the éléments of the Royal
Art.</p>
<p>So far as mysticism is concerned, the technique is extremely simple,
and has been very simply described in Part I of this Book 4. It cannot
be said too strongly that any amouni of mystical success whatever is 110
compensation for slackness with regard to the technique. There may corne
a time when Samadhi itself is no part of the business of the mystic. But
the character developed by the original training re¬ mains an asset. In
other words, the person who has made himself a first-class brain capable
of elasticity is competent to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some few forms of exercise are exempt from these strictures. Rock-
climbing, in particular, trains every muscle in an endless variety of
ways. It moreover compels the learner to use his own judgment, to rely
on himself, to develop resource, and to dépend upon his own originality
to attack each new problem that présents itself. This principle may be
extended to ail departments of the éducation of children. They should be
put into contact with ail kinds of truth, and allowed to make their own
reflections thereon and reactions thereto, without the least attempt to
bias their judg¬ ment. Magical pupils should be trained on similar
lines. They should be made to work alone from the first, to cover the
whole ground impartially, to devise their own experiments and draw their
own conclusions.</li>
</ol>
<p>201</p>
<p>attack any problem soever, when he who has merely specialized has got
into a groove, and can no longer adapt and adjust himself to new
conditions.</p>
<p>The principle is quite universal. You do not train a violonist to
play the Beethoven Concerto 3 you train him to play every conceivable
consecution of notes with perfect ease, and you keep him at the most
monotonous drill possible for years and years before you allow him to go
on the platform. You make of him an instrument perfectly able to adjust
itself to any musical problem that may be set before him. This technique
of Yoga is the most important detail of ail our work. The Master Therion
has been himself somewhat to blâme in representing this technique as of
value simply because it leads to the great rewards, such as Samadhi. He
would hâve been wiser to base His teaching solely on the ground of
évolution. But probably He thought of the words of the poet :</p>
<p>U Y ou dangle a canot in front of her no se.</p>
<p>And she go es wherever the canot go es</p>
<p>For, after ail, one cannot explain the necessity of the study of
Latin either to imbécile children or to stupid educationalists; for, not
having learned Latin, they hâve not developed the brains to learn
anvthing.</p>
<p>The Hindus, understanding these difficulties, hâve taken the
God-Almighty attitude about the matter. If you go to a Hindu teacher, he
treats you as less than an earthworm. You hâve to do this, and you hâve
to do that, and you are not allowed to know why you are doing it. 1</p>
<p>After years of expérience in teaching, The Master Tuerion is not
altogether convinced that this is not the right attitude.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This does not conflict with the “go-as-you-please” plan put forward
in the previous note. An autocratie Adept is indeed a blessing to the
disciple, not because he is able to guide the pupil “aright” in the
particular path which happens to suit his personality, but because he
can compel the beginner to grind away at the weariest work and thus
acquire all-round ability, and prevent him from picking out the plums
which please him from the Pie of Knowledge, and making himself sick of a
surfeit of sweets to the neglect of a balanced diet of wholesome
nourishment.</li>

<p>en peop.e begin to argue about things instead of doing them they
become absolutely impossible. Their minds begin to work about it and
about, and they corne out by the same door as in they went. ey remain
brutish, voluble, and uncomprehending.</p>
<p>. lhe L tech mque of Magick is just as important as that of mysti-
asm, but here we hâve a very much more difficult problem, because the
original unit of Magick, the Body of Light, is alreadv something
unfamiliar to the ordinary person. Nevertheless, this body must be
developed and trained with exactly the same rigid iscipline as the brain
in the case of mysticism. The essence of the echnique of Magick is the
development of the body of Light</p>
<p>which must be extended to include ail members of the organism,’ and
mdeed of the cosmos.</p>
<p>The most important drill practices are :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The fortification of the Body of Light by the constant use of
rituals, by the assumption of God-forms, and by the right use of the
liucharist.</li>

<p>2.1 he purification and consécration and exaltation of that üody by
the use of rituals of invocation.</p>
<p>3- The éducation of that Body by expérience. It must learn to travel
on every plane; to break down every obstacle which may confront it This
expérience must be as systematic and regular as possible ; for it is of
no use merely to travel to the spheres of</p>

<p>The object is to possess a Body wkicli is capable of doing easily any
particular task tbat may lie before it. There musî be no sélection of
spécial expérience which appeals to one’s immédiate desire. One must go
steadily through ail the possible pylons.</p>
<p>Frater Perdurabo was very unfortunate in not having magical teachers
to explain these things to Him. He was rather encouraged in unsystematic
working. Very fortunate, on the other hand, was He to hâve found a Guru
who instructed Him in the proper principles of the technique of Yoga,
and He, having suffirent sense to recognize the universal application of
those principles, was able to some extent to repair His original
defects. But even to this day, despite the fact this His original
inclination is much stronger towards Magick than towards mysticism, he
is much less competent in Magick. 1 A trace of this can be seen even in
His method of combining the two divisions of our science, for in that
method He makes concentration bear the Cross of the Work.</p>
<p>This is possibly an error, probably a defect, certainly an impurity
of thought, and the root of it is to be found in His original bad
discipline with regard to Magick.</p>
<p>If the reader will turn to the account of his astral journeys in the
Second Number of the First Volume of the Equinox, he will find that
these experiments were quite capricious. Even when, in Mexico, He got
the idea of exploring the 30 Aethyrs systemat- ically, He abandoned the
vision after only 2 Aethyrs had been investigated.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reconsideration of these remarks, at the request of a loyal
colleague, compels Him to admit that this may not be the case. It is
true that He has been granted ail Mystical Attainment that is
theoretically possible, while His powers in Magick seem to be uneven and
imperfect. Despite this, it may yet be that He has compassed the
Possible. For Mystical Attainments are never mutually exclusive; the
trance of Sorrow (for example) is not incompatible with the Béatifie
Vision, or the “Universal Joke”. But in Magick any one Operation debars
its performer from accomplishing some other. The reason of this is that
the Oath of any Work bonds the Magi- cian once and for ail to be the
principles implied therein. See Chapter XVI Part I. Further, it is
obviously possible to reach the essence of anything without interfering
with other things which obstruct each other. Cross- country journeys are
often scarcely practicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>204 —</p>
<p>Very different is His record after the training in 1901 e. v. had put
Him in the wav of discipline. 1</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this part of this book, one may sum up the whole
matter in these words : There is no object whatever worthy of attainment
but the regular development of tbe being of the Aspirant by steady
scientific work; he should not attempt to run before he can walk; he
should not wish to go somewhere until he knows for certain whither he
wills £0 go.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Recent developments hâve enabled Him to correct these conditions, so
that this Book (as now hnally revised for the Press) may be considered
practically free from serious defect in this particular.</li>

<p>The object of this course of reading is to familiarize the student
with ail that has been said by the Great Masters in every time and
country. He should make a critical examination of themj not so much with
the idea of discovering where truth lies, for he cannot do this except
by virtue of his own spiritual expérience, but rather to discover the
essential harmony in those varied Works. He should be on his guard
against partisanship with a favourite author. He should familiarize
himself thoroughly with the method of mental equilibrium, endeavouring
to contradict any statement soever, although it may be apparently
axiomatic.</p>
<p>The general object of this course, besides that already stated, is to
assure sound éducation in occult matters, so that when spiritual
illumination cornes it may find a well-built temple. Where the mind is
strongly biased towards any spécial theory, the resuit of an
illumination is often to inflame that portion of the mind which is thus
overdeveloped, with the resuit that the aspirant, instead of becoming an
Adept, becomes a bigot and fanatic.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>The A.*. A.’, does not offer examination in this course, but
recommends these books as the foundation of a library.</p>

<li><p>The Order of the Star called S. S. is, in respect of its
existence upon the Earth, an organised body of men and women
distinguished among their fellows by the qualities here enumerated. They
exist in their own Truth, which is both universal and unique.</p></li>
<li><p>The Name of The Order and those of its three divisions are not
disclosed to the profane. Certain swindlers hâve recently stolen the

<p>They move in accordance with their own Wills, which are each unique,

<p>lhey perceive (that is, understand, know, and feel) in love, which is
both unique and universal.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The order consists of eleven grades or degrees, and is numbered as

<p>Probationer . 0 ° = 0 G</p>
<p>(These figures hâve spécial meanings to the initiated and are
commonly employed to designate the grades.)</p>
<p>The general characteristics and attributions of these Grades are
indicated by their correspondences on the Tree of Life, as may be
studied in detail in the Book 777.</p>
<p>Strident. — His business is to acquire a general intellectua!
knowledge of ail Systems of attainment, as declared in the prescribed
books. (See curriculum in Appendix I.)</p>
<p>Probationer. — His principal business is to begin such practices as
he may prefer ? and to Write a careful record of the same for one
year.</p>
<p>Néophyte. — Has to acquire perfect control of the Astral Plane.</p>
<p>Zelator. — His main work is to achieve complète success in Asana and
Pranayama. He also begins to study the formula of the Rosy Cross.</p>
<p>Practicus. — Is expected to complété his intellectual training, and
in particular to study the Qabalah.</p>
<p>Philosophus. — Is expected to complété his moral training. He is
tested in Dévotion to the Order.</p>
<p>Dominus Liminis. — Is expected to show mastery of Pratyahara and
Dharana.</p>
<p>Adeptus (without). — Is expected to perform the Great Work and to
attain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</p>
<p>Adeptus (within). — Is admitted to the practice of the formula of the
Rosy Cross on entering the College of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Adeptus (Major). — Obtains a general mastery of practical Magick,
though without compréhension.</p>
<p>Adeptus (Exemptus). — Complétés in perfection ail these mat- ters. He
then either (a) becomes a Brother of the Left Hand Path or, ( b ) is
stripped of ali his attainments and of him- self as weil, even of his
Holy Guardian Angel, and becomes a Babe of the Abyss, who, having
transcended the Reason, does nothing but grow in the womb of its mother.
It then finds itself a</p>
<p>Magister Templi. — (Master of the Temple) : whose functions are fully
described in Liber 418, as is this whole initiation from Adeptus
Exemptus. See also “Aha!”. His principal business is to tend his
“garden” of disciples, and to obtain a perfect understanding of the
Universe. He is a Master of Samadhi.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>Magus. — Attains to wisdom, déclarés his law (See Liber I, vel Magi)
and is a Master of ail Magick in its greatest and highest sense.</p>
<p>Ipsissimus. — Is beyond ail this and beyond ail compréhension of
those of lower degrees.</p>
<p>But of these last three Grades see some further account in The Temple
of Solomon the King , Equinox I to X and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It should be stated that these Grades are not necessarily attained
fully, and in strict consecution, or manifested wholly on ail planes.
The subject is very difficulté and entirely beyond the limits of this
small treatise.</p>
<p>We append a more detailed account.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Order of the S. S. is composed of those who hâve crossed the
Abyss; the implications of this expression may be studied in Liber 418,
the 14Ü1, I3th, I2th, nth, ioth and 9th Aethyrs in particular.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ail members of the Order are in full possession of the Formulae of
Attainment, both mystical or inwardly-directed and Magical or
outwardly-directed. They hâve full expérience of attainment in both
these paths.</p>
<p>They are ail, however, bound by the original and fundamental Oath of
the Order, to devote their energy to assisting the Progress of their
Inferiors in the Order. Those who accept the rewards of their
émancipation for themselves are no longer within the Order.</p>
<p>Members of the Order are each entitled to found Orders dépendent on
themselves on the lines of the R. C. and G. D. orders, to cover types of
émancipation and illumination not contemplated by the original (or main)
System. Ail such orders must, however, be constituted in harmony with
the A.<em>. A.</em>, as regards the essential principles.</p>
<p>Ail members of the Order are in possession of the Word of the
existing Aeon, and govern themselves thereby.</p>
<p>They are entitled to communicate directly with any and every member
of the Order, as they may deem fitting.</p>
<p>Every active Member of the Order has destroyed ail that He is and ail
that He has on Crossing the Abyss; but a star is cast forth in</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>the Heavens to enlighten the Earth, so that he may possess a vehicle
wherein he may communicate with mankind. The quality and position of
this star, and its functions, are determined by the nature of the
incarnations transcended by him.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Grade of Ipsissimus is not to be described îully; but its
opening is indicated in Liber I vel MagL</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also an account in a certain secret document to be published
when propriety permits. Here it is only said this : The Ipsissimus is
wholly free from ail limitations soever, existing in the nature of ail
things without discriminations of quantity or quality between them. He
has identified Being and not-Being and Becoming, action and non-action
and tendency to action, with ail other such triplicities, not
distinguishing between them in respect of any conditions, or between any
one thing and any other thing as to whether it is with or without
conditions.</p>
<p>He is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to
express its nature in word and deed, but to withdraw Himself at once
within the veils of his natural manifestation as a man, and to keep
silence during his human life as to the fact of his attainment, even to
the other members of the Order.</p>
<p>The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of ail modes of existence
; that is, his being is entirely free from internai or external
necessity. His work is to destroy ail tendencies to construct or to
cancel such necessities. He is the Master of the Law of Unsubstan-
tiality (Anatta).</p>
<p>The Ipsissimus has no relation as such with any Being : He has no
will in any direction, and no Consciousness of any kind involving
duality, for in Him ail is accomplished; as it is written “beyond the
Word and the Fool, yea, beyond the Word and the Fool”.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The Grade of Magus is described in Liber I vel Magi, and there are
accounts of its character in Liber 418 in the Higher Aethyrs.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a full and précisé description of the attainment of
this Grade in the Magical Record of the Beast 666.</p>
<p>The essential characteristic of the Grade is that its possessor
utters a Creative Magical Word, which transforms the planet on</p>
<p>234 —</p>
<p>which he lives by the installation of new officers to présidé over
its initiation. This can take place only at an “Equinox of the Gods” at
the end of an “Aeon”; that is, when the secret formula which expresses
the Law of its action becomes outworn and useless to its further
development.</p>
<p>(Thus “Suckling” is the formula of an infant : when teeth appear it
marks a new “Aeon”, whose “Word” is “Eating”).</p>
<p>A Magus can therefore only appear as such to the world at inter- vais
of some centuries ; accounts of historical Magi, and their Words, are
given in Liber Aleph.</p>
<p>This does not mean that only one man can attain this Grade in any one
Aeon, so far as the Order is concerned. A man can make Personal progress
équivalent to that of a “Word of an Aeon”; but he will identify himself
with the current word, and exert his will to establish it, lest he
conflict with the work of the Magus who uttered the Word of the Aeon in
which He is living.</p>
<p>The Magus is pre-eminently the Master of Magick, that is, his will is
entirely free from internai diversion or external opposition; His work
is to create a new Universe in accordance with His Will. He is the
Master of the Law of Change (Anicca).</p>
<p>To attain the Grade of Ipsissimus he must accomplish three tasks,
destroying the Three Guardians mentioned in Liber 418, the 3rd Aethyr;
Madness, and Falsehood, and Glamour, that is, Duality in Act, Word and
Thought.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The Grade of Master of the Temple is described in Liber 418 as above
indicated. There are full accounts in the Magical Diaries of the Beast
666, who was cast forth into the Heaven of Jupiter, and of Omnia in Uno,
Unus in Omnibus, who was cast forth into the sphere of the
Eléments.</li>
</ol>
<p>The essential Attainment is the perfect annihilation of that
personality which limits and oppresses his true self.</p>
<p>The Magister Templi is pre-eminently the Master of Mysticism, that
is, His Understanding is entirely free from internai contradic¬ tion or
external obscurity; His word is to comprehend the existing Universe in
accordance with His own Mind. He is the Master of the Law of Sorrow
(Dukkha).</p>
<p>To attain the grade of Magus he must accomplish Three</p>
<p>— 235 —</p>
<p>Tasksj the renunciation of His enjoyment of the Infinité so that he
may formulate Himself as the Finite; the acquisition of the practical
secrets alike of initiating and governing His proposed new Universe and
the identification of himself with the impersonal idea of Love. Any
néophyte of the Order (or, as some say, an y person soever) possesses
the right to claim the Grade of Master of the Temple by taking the Oath
of the Grade. It is hardly necessary to observe that to do so is the
most sublime and awful responsibility which it is possible to assume,
and an unworthy person who does so incurs the most terrifie penalties by
his presumption.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The Order of the R. C. The Grade of the Babe of the Abyss is not a
Grade in the proper sense, being rather a passage between the two
Orders. Its characteristics are wholly négative, as it is attained by
the résolve of the Adeptus Exemptus to surren- der ail that he has and
is for ever. It is an annihilation of ail the bonds that compose the
self or constitute the Cosmos, a résolution of ail complexities into
their éléments, and these thereby cease to manifest, since things are
only knowable in respect of their relation to, and reaction on, other
things.</li>
</ol>
<p>8 . The Grade of Adeptus Exemptus confers authority to govern the two
lower Orders of R. C. and G. D.</p>
<p>The Adept must préparé and publish a thesis setting forth His
knowledge of the Universe, and his proposais for its welfare and
progress. He wil .1 thus be known as the leader of a school of
thought.</p>
<p>(Eliphas Levi’s Clef des Grands Mystères , the Works of Swedenborg,
von Eckartshausen, Robert Fludd, Paracelsus, Newton, Bolyai, Hinton,
Berkeley, Loyola, etc., etc., are examples of such essays. )</p>
<p>He will hâve attained ail but the suprême summits of médita¬ tion,
and should be already prepared to perceive that the only possible course
for him is to devote himself utterly to heiping his fellow
créatures.</p>
<p>To attain the Grade of Magister Templi, he must perform two tasks;
the émancipation from thought by putting each idea against its opposite,
and refusing to prefer eitherj and the consécration of</p>
<p>236 —</p>
<p>himself as a pure vehicle for the influence of the order to which he
aspires.</p>
<p>He must then décidé upon the critical adventure of our Order ; the
absolute abandonment of himself and his attainments. He can- not remain
indefinitely an Exempt Adept; he is pushed onward by the irrésistible
momentum that he has generated.</p>
<p>Should he fail, by will or weakness, to make his self-annihilation
absolute, he is none the less thrust forth into the Abyss; but instead
of being received and reconstructed in the Third Order, as a Babe in the
womb of our Lady Babalon, under the Night of Pan, to grow up to be
Himself wholly and truly as He was not previously, he remains in the
Abyss, secreting his éléments round his Ego as if isolated from the
Universe, and becomes what is called a “Black Brother”. Such a being is
gradually disintegrated from lack of nourishment and the slow but
certain action of the attraction of the rest of the Universe, despite
his now desperate efforts to insulate and protect himself, and to
aggrandise himself by predatory practices. He may indeed prosper for a
while, but in the end he must perish, especially when with a new Aeon a
new Word is pro- claimed which he cannot and will not hear, so that he
is handi- capped by trying to use an obsolète method of Magick, like a
man with a boomerang in a battle where every one else has a rifle.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>The Grade of Adeptus Major confers Magical Powers (strictly
so-called) of the second rank.</li>
</ol>
<p>His work is to use these to support the authority of the Exempt Adept
his superior. (This is not to be understood as an obligation of personal
subservience or even loyalty; but as a neces- sary part of his duty to
assist his inferiors. For the authority of the Teaching and Governing
Adept is the basis of ail orderly work. )</p>
<p>To attain the Grade of Adeptus Exemptus, he must accomplish Three
Tasks; the acquisition of absolute Self-Reliance, working in complété
isolation, yet transmitting the word of his superior clearly, forcibly
and subtlv; and the compréhension and use of the Révolution of the wheel
of force, under its three successive forms of Radiation, Conduction and
Convection (Mercury, Sulphur, Sait ; or Sattvas, Rajas, Tamas), with
their corresponding natures on</p>
<p>~ 237 —</p>
<p>other planes. Thirdly, he must exert his whole power and author- ity
to govern the Members of lower Grades with balanced vigour and
initiative in such a way as to allow no dispute or complainte he must
employ to this end the formula called “The Beast conjoined with the
Woman” which establishes a new incarnation of deity ; as in the legends
of Leda, Semele, Miriam, Pasiphae, and others. He must set up this idéal
for the orders which he rules, so that they may possess a not too
abstract rallying-point suited to their unde- veloped States.</p>
<p>10 . The Grade of Adeptus Minor is the main thème of the instructions
of the A.’. A.*. It is characterised by the Attain- ment of the
Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. (See the Equinox,
The Temple of Solomon the King:  The Vision and the Voice 8th Aethyrj
also Liber Samekh , etc. etc.) This is the essential work of every man;
none other ranks with it either for personal progress or for power to
help one’s fel- lows. This unachieved, man is no more than the
unhappiest and blindest of animais. He is conscious of his own
incompréhensible calamity, and clumsily incapable of repairing it.
Achieved, he is no less than the co-heir of gods, a Lord of Light. He is
conscious of his own consecrated course, and confidently ready to run
it. The Adeptus Minor needs little help or guidance even from his
superiors in our Order.</p>
<p>His work is to manifest the Beauty of the Order to the world, in the
way that his superiors enjoin, and his genius dictâtes.</p>
<p>To attain the Grade Adeptus Major, he must accomplish two tasks; the
équilibration of himself, especiaily as to his passions, so that he has
no preference for any one course of conduct over another, and the
fulfilment of every action by its complément, so that whatever he does
leaves him without temptation to wander from the way of his True
Will.</p>
<p>Secondly, he must keep silence, while he nails his body to the tree
of his Creative will, in the shape of that Will, leaving his head and
arms to form the Symbol of Light, as if to make oath that his every
thought, Word and deed should express the Light derived from the God
with which he has identified his life, his love and his liberty —
symbolised by his heart, his phallus, and his legs. It</p>
<p>238 —</p>
<p>is impossible to lay down précisé rules by which a man may attain to
the knowledge and conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel ; for that is
the particular secret of each one of us; a secret not to be told or even
divined by any other, whatever his grade. It is the Holy of Holies,
whereof each man is his own High Priest, and none knoweth the Name of
his brother’s God, or the Rite that invokes Him.</p>
<p>The Masters of the A A .*. hâve therefore made no attempt to
institute any regular ritual for this central Work of their Order, save
the generalised instructions in Liber 418 (the 8th Aethyr) and the
detailed Canon and Rubric of the Mass actually used with suc- cess by
Frater Perdurabo in His attainment. This has been written down by
Himself in Liber Samekh. But they hâve published such accounts as those
in The Terrifie of Solomon the King and in John St. John. They hâve
taken the only proper course; to train aspirants to this attainment in
the theory and prac¬ tice of the whole of Magick and Mysticism, so that
each man may be expert in the handling of ail known weapons, and free to
choose and to use those which his own expérience and instinct dictate as
proper when he essays the Great Experiment.</p>
<p>He is furthermore trained to the one habit essential to Member- ship
of the A.’. A.’.; he must regard ail his attainments as primarily the
property of those less advanced aspirants who are confided to his
charge.</p>
<p>No attainment soever is officially recognised by the A.<em>. A.</em>,
unless the immédiate inferior of the person in question has been fitted
by him to take his place.</p>
<p>The rule is not rigidly applied in ail cases, as it would lead to
congestion, especially in the lower grades where the need is greatest,
and the conditions most confused; but it is never relaxed in the Order
of the R. C. or of the S. S. : save only in One Case.</p>
<p>There is also a rule that the Members of the A A shall not know each
other officially, save only each Member his superior who introduced him
and his inferior whom he has himself introduced.</p>
<p>This rule has been relaxed, and a “Grand Néophyte” appointed to
superintend ail Members of the Order of the G. D. The real object of the
rule was to prevent Members of the same Grade</p>
<p>— 239 —</p>
<p>working together and so blurring each other’s individuality; also to
prevent work developing into social intercourse.</p>
<p>The Grades of the Order of the G. D. are fully descrihed in Liber 185
1 , and there is no need to amplify what is there stated. It must
however, be carefuliy remarked that in each of these preliminary Grades
there are appointed certain tasks appropriate, and that the ample
accomplishment of each and every one of these is insisted upon with the
most rigorous rigidity. 2 3 * * * *</p>
<p>Members of the A A of whatever grade are not bound or expected or
even encouraged to work on any stated lines, or with any spécial object,
save as has been above set forth. There is however an absolute
prohibition to accept money or other material reward, directly or
indirectly, in respect of any service connected with the Order, for
personal profit or advantage. The penalty is immédiate expulsion, with
no possibility of reinstatement on any terms soever.</p>
<p>But ail members must of necessity work in accordance with the facts
of Nature, just as an architect must allow for the Law of Gravitation,
or a sailor reckon with currents.</p>
<p>So must ail Members of the A.:. A.:, work by the Magical Formula of
the Aeon.</p>
<p>They must accept the Book of the Law as the Word and the Letter of
Truth, and the sole Rule of Life . 9 They must acknow- ledge the
Authority of the Beast 666 and of the Scarlet Woman as</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This book is published in the Equinox Vol. III No. 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Liber 185 need not be quoted at length. It is needful only to say
that the Aspirant is trained systematically and comprehensively in the
various technical practices which form the basis of Our Work. One may
become expert in any or ail of these without necessarily making any real
progress, just as a man might be first-rate at grammar, syntax, and
prosody without being able to write a single line of good poetry,
although the greatest poet in soûl is unable to express himself without
the aid of those three éléments of literary composition.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not in contradiction with the absolute right o f every
person</p></li>
</ol>
<p>to do his own true Will. But any True Will is of necessity in
harmony</p>
<p>with the facts of Existence; and to refuse to accept the Book of the
Law</p>
<p>is to create a conflict within Nature, as if a physicist insisted on
using an</p>
<p>incorrect formula of mechanics as the basis of an experiment.</p>
<p>240 —</p>
<p>in the book it is defined, and accept Their Will 1 as concentrating
the Will of our Whole Order. They must accept the Crowned and Conquering
Child as the Lord of the Aeon, and exert them- selves to establish His
reign upon Earth. They must acknowledge that “The Word of the Law is 0
EAHMA and that “Love is the Law, love under Will.”</p>
<p>Each member must make it his main work to discover for himself his
own true will, and to do it, and do nothing else. 2</p>
<p>He must accept those orders in the Book of the Law that apply to
himself as being necessarily in accordance with his own true will, and
execute the same to the letter with ail the energy, courage, and ability
that he can command. This applies especially to the work of extending
the Law in the world, wherein his proof is his own success, the witness
of his Life to the Law that hath given him light in his ways, and
liberty to pursue them. Thus doing, he payeth his debt to the Law that
hath freed him by working its will to free ail men; and he proveth
himself a true man in our Order by willing to bring his fellows into
freedom.</p>
<p>By thus ordering his disposition, he will fit himself in the best
possible manner for the task of understanding and mastering the divers
technical methods prescribed by the A A for Mystical and M agi cal
attainment.</p>
<p>He will thus préparé himself properly for the crisis of his career in
the Order, the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy
Guardian Angel.</p>
<p>His Angel shall lead him anon to the summit of the Order of the R. C.
and make him ready to face the unspeakable terror of the Abyss which
lies between Manhood and Godhead; teach him to Know that agony, to Dare
that destiny, to Will that catastrophe,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Their Will” — not, of course, their wishes as individual human
beings, but their will as ofhcers of the New Aeon.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . It is not considered “essential to right conduct” to be an active
propagandist of the Law, and so on; it may, or may not, be the True Will
of any particular person to do so. But since the fundamental purpose of
the Order is to further the Attainment of humanity, membership implies,
by définition, the Will to help mankind by the means best adapted
thereto.</p>
<p>— 241</p>
<p>and to keep Silence for ever as he accomplishes the act of annihila¬
tion.</p>
<p>From the Abyss cornes No Man forth, but a Star startles the Earth,
and our Order rejoices above that Abyss that the Beast hath begotten one
more Babe in the Womb of Our Lady, His Concubine, the Scarlet Woman,
Babalon.</p>
<p>There is no need to instruct a Babe thus born, for in the Abyss it
was purified of every poison of personality; its ascent to the highest
is assured, in its season, and it hath no need of seasons for it is
conscious that ail conditions are no more than forms of its&lt;
fancy.</p>
<p>Such is a brief account, adapted as far as may be to the average
aspirant to Adeptship, or Attainment, or Initiation, or Mastership, or
Union with God, or Spiritual Development, or Mahatmaship, or Freedom, or
Occult Knowledge, or whatever he may call his inmost need of Truth, of
our Order of A.-. A.*.</p>
<p>It is designed principally to awake interest in the possibilités of
human progress, and to proclaim the principles of the A A</p>
<p>The outline given of the several successive steps is exact; the two
crises — the Angel and the Abyss — are necessary features in every
career. The other tasks are not always accomplished in the order given
here; one man, for example, may acquire many of the qualités peculiar to
the Adeptus Major, and yet lack some of those proper to the Practicus. 1
But the System here given shows</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The natural talents of individuals difFer very widely. The late Sir
Richard Jebb, one of the greatest classical schoîars of modem times, was
so inferior to the average mediocrity in mathematics, that despite
repeated efforts he could not pass the “little go” at Cambridge — which
the dullest minds can usually do. He was so deeply esteemed for his
classés that a spécial “Grâce” was placeted so as to admit him to
matriculation. Similarly a brilliant Exorcist might be an incompetent
Diviner. In such a case the A A would refuse to swerve from Its system;
the Aspirant wouîd be compelled to remain at the Barrier until he
succeeded in breaking it down, though a new incarnation were necessary
to permit him to do so. But no technical failure of any kind soever
could necessarily prevent him from accomplishing the Two Critical Tasks,
since the fact of his incarnation itself proves that he has taken the
Oath which entitled him to attain to the Knowledge and Conversation of
his Holy Guardian Angel, and the</li>
</ol>
<p>242</p>
<p>the correct order of events, as they are arranged in Nature ; and in
no case is it safe for a man to neglect to master any single detail,
however dreary and distasteful it may seem. It often does so, indeedj
that only insists on the necessity of dealing with it. The dislike and
contempt for it bear witness to a weakness and incom- pleteness in the
nature which disowns it ; that particular gap in one’s defences may
admit the enemy at the very turning-point of some battle. Worse, one
were shamed for ever if one ? s inferior should happen to ask for advice
and aid on that subject and one were to fail in service to him! His
failure — one’s own failure also! No step, however well won for oneself,
till he is ready for his own advance!</p>
<p>Every Member of the A A must be armed at ail points, and expert with
every weapon. The examinations in every Grade are strict and severej no
loose or vague answers are accepted. In inteliectual questions, the
candidate must display no less mastery of his subject than if he were
entered in the “final” for Doctor of Science or Law at a first class
University.</p>
<p>In examination of physical practices, there is a standardised test.
In Asana, for instance, the candidate must remain motionless for a given
time, his success being gauged by poising on his head a cup filled with
water to the brim; if he spill one drop, he is rejected.</p>
<p>He is tested in “the Spirit Vision” or “Astral Journeying” by giving
him a symbol unknown and unintelligible to him, and he must interpret
its nature by means of a vision as exactly as if he had read its name
and description in the book when it was chosen.</p>
<p>The power to make and “charge” talismans is tested as if they were
scientific instruments of précision, as they are.</p>
<p>In the Qabalah, the candidate must discover for himself, and prove to
the examiner beyond ail doubt, the properties of a number never
previously examined by any student.</p>
<p>annihilation of this Ego. One might therefore be an Adeptus Minor or
even a Magister Templi, in essence, though refused official récognition
by the A A as a Zelator owing to (say) a nervous defect which prevented
him from acquiring a Posture which was “steady and easy 1” as required
by the Task of that grade.</p>
<p>— 243</p>
<p>In invocation the divine force must be made as manifest and
unmistakeable as the efifects of chloroform; in évocation, the spirit
called forth must be at least as visible and tangible as the heaviest
vapoursj in divination, the answer must be as précisé as a scientific
thesis, and as accurate as an audit ; in méditation, the results must
read like a spécialistes report of a classical case.</p>
<p>By such methods, the A .’. A intends to make occult science as
systematic and scientific as chemistry; to rescue it from the ill repute
which, thanks both to the ignorant and dishonest quacks that hâve
prostituted its name, and to the fanatical and narrow-minded enthusiasts
that hâve turned it into a fetish, has made it an object of aversion to
those very minds whose enthusiasm and integrity make them most in need
of its benefits, and most fit to obtain them.</p>
<p>It is the one really important science, for it transcends the condi¬
tions of material existence and so is not liable to perish with the
planet, and it must be studied as a science, sceptically, with the
utmost energy and patience.</p>
<p>The A A possesses the secrets of successj it makes no secret of its
knowledge, and if its secrets are not everywhere known and practised, it
is because the abuses connected with the name of occult science
disincline official investigators to examine the evidence at their
disposai.</p>
<p>This paper has been written not only with the object of attracting
individual seekers into the way of Truth, but of affirming the propriety
of the methods of the A.’. A.*, as the basis for the next great step in
the advance of human knowledge.</p>

<p>APPENDÏX III</p>
<p>Notes on the nature of the “Astral Plane”  </p>
<ol type="i">
<li>What are “Astral” and “Spiritual” Beings?</li>
</ol>
<p>Man is one: it is a case of any consciousness assuming a sensible
form.</p>
<p>Microcosms and elementals. Maybe an elemental (e.g. a dog) has a
cosmic conception in which he is a microcosm and man incomplète. No
means of deciding same, as in case of kinds of space. 1 2</p>
<p>Similarly, our gross matter may appear unreal to Beings clad in fine
matter. Thus, science thinks vulgar perceptions “error”. We cannot
perceive at ail except within our gamut; as, concentrated perfumes,
which seem malodorous, and time-hidden facts, such as the vanes of a
revolving fan, which flies can distinguish.</p>
<p>Hence: no a friori reason to deny the existence of conscious
intelligences with insensible bodies. Indeed we know of other orders of
mind (flies, etc., possibly vegetables) thinking by means of non-human
brain-structures.</p>
<p>But the fundamental problem of Religion is this: Is there any
praeter-human Intelligence, of the same order as our own,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On considération these notes hâve been left as they were
originally written. In An XVII, Sol in Virgo, Soror Rhodon, a
probatîoner of A .*. A at that time in enjoyment of the privilège of
sojourning in a certain secret Abbey of Thelema, asked Him to add to
this book an out- line of the uranography of the Astral Planes, in less
technical language than that of Liber 777. These notes were accordingly
jotted down by Him. To elaborate them further would hâve been to make
them disproportionate to the rest of this treatise.</p></li>
<li><p>See Poincaré, passages a^oted infra.</p></li>

<p>which is not dépendent on cérébral structures consisting of matter in
lise vulgar sense of the word ?</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>“Matter” includes ail that is moveable. Thus, electric waves are
“matter”. There is no reason to deny the existence of Beings who
perceive by other means those subtle forces which we only perceive by
our instruments.</p></li>
<li><p>We can influence other Beings, conscious or no, as lion- tamers,
gardeners, etc. ; and are influenced by them, as bv storms, bacilli,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an apparent gap between our senses and their
correspondances in consciousness. Theory needs a medium to join matter
and spirit, just as physics once needed an “ether” to transmit and
transmute vibrations.</p></li>
<li><p>We may consider ail beings as parts of ourselves, but it is more
convenant to regard them as independent. Maximum Conv emence is our
canon of “Truth”. 1 We may thus refer</p></li>

<p>1 The passages referred to are as follows :</p>
<p>, ^ e f ax iomes géométriques ne sont donc ni des jugements
synthétiques a priori ni des faits expérimentaux. Ce sont des
conventions…</p>
<p>Dès lors, que doit-on penser de cette question : La géométrie
Euclidienne est-elle vraie ?</p>
<p>Elle n a aucun sens. Autant demander si le système métrique est vrai
et les anciennes mesures fausses; si les coordonnées cartésiennes sont
vraies et les coordonnées polaires fausses. Une géométrie ne peut pas
être plus vraie qu’une autre; elle peut seulement être plus commode.</p>
<p>. P n veut d ire ( l ue P ar sélection naturelle notre esprit s’est
adapté aux con¬ ditions^ du monde extérieur, qu’il a adopté la géométrie
la plus avantageuse à l’espèce; ou en d’autres termes la plus commode.
Cela est conforme tout a fait à nos conclusions; la géométrie n’est pas
vraie: elle est avantageuse.” Poincaré, IL,a Science et P Hypothèse.</p>
<p>Nous choisirons donc ces règles non parce qu’elles sont vraies,
mais</p>
<p>parce qu’elles sont les plus commodes, et nous pourrions les résumer
ainsi en disant :</p>
<p>U</p>
<p>La simultanéité de deux événements, ou l’ordre de leur succession,
l’égalité de deux durées, doivent être définies de telle sorte que
l’énoncé des lois naturelles soit aussi simple que possible. En d’autres
termes, toutes ces règles, toutes ces définitions ne sont pas que le
fruit d’un opportunisme inconscient. Poincaré, P,a Valeur de la

<p>psychical phenomena to the intention of “Astral” Beings, without
committing ourselves to any theory. Cohérence is the sole quality
demanded of us.</p>
<p>6 ) Magick enables us to receive sensible impressions of worlds other
than the “physical” universe (as generally understood by profane
science). These worlds hâve their own laws; their inhabitants are often
of quasi-human intelligence ; there is a definite set of relations
between certain “ideas” of ours, and their expressions, and certain
types of phenomena. (Thus, symbols, the Qabalah, etc. enable us to
communicate with whom we choose.)</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>“Astral” Beings possess knowledge and power of a different kind from
our own; their “universe” is presumably of a different kind from ours,
in some respects. (Our idea “bone” is not the same as a dog’s; a
short-sighted man sees things differently to one of normal vision.) It
is more convenient to assume the objective existence of an “Angel” who
gives us new knowledge than to allégé that our invocation has awakened a
supernormal power in ourselves. Such incidents as “Calderazzo” 1 and
“Jacob” 2 make this more cogent.</li>
</ol>
<p>rebuttal. But most of these subtleties miss the point. Truth must be
defined. It is a name, being a noun (nomen); and ail names are human
symbols of things. Now Truth is the power to arouse a certain reaction
(“assent”) in a man, under certain conditions; (“greenness”, weight, ail
other qualities, are also powers). It exists in the object, whether
latent or manifest; so experiencing both does and does not alter the
facts. This is Solipsism, because we can only be conscious of our own
consciousness; yet it is not Solipsism, because our consciousness tells
us that its changes are due to the impact of an external force. Newton’s
First Law makes this a matter of définition.</p>
<p>“What is truth ?”, beyond this, inquires into the nature of this
power. It is inhérent in ail things, since ail possible propositions, or
their contra- dictories, can be affirmed as true. Its condition is
identity of form (or Structure) of the Monads involved.</p>
<p>It requires a quality of mind beyond the &lt;£ normal” to appreciate
0 °=X, etc., directly, just as H. H. Joachim’s reasoning demands a
point-of-view beyond that of the Bushman.</p>
<p>1 See the story, infra, about the origin of Book 4.</p>
<p>2 See the story, infra, about Amalantrah.</p>
<p>2 47</p>
<p>8 ) The Qabaiah maps ourselves by means of a convention. Every aspect
of every object may thus be referred to the Tree of Life, and evoked by
using the proper keys.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>Time and Space are forms by which we obtain (distorted) images of
Ideas. Our measures of Time and Space 1 are crude conventions, and
differ widely for different Beings. (Hashish shows how the same mind may
vary.)</p></li>
<li><p>We may admit that any aspect of any object or idea may be
presented to us in a symbolic form, whose relation to its Being is
irrational. (Thus, there is no rational link between seeing a bell
struck and hearing its chime. Our notion of “bell” is no more than a
personification of its impressions on our senses. And our wit and power
to make a bell “to order” imply a sériés of corres- pondences between
various orders of nature precisely analogous to Magick, when we obtain a
Vision of Beauty by the use of certain colours, forms, sounds,
etc.)</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>“Astral” Beings may thus be defined in the same way as “material
objects”; they are the Unknown Causes of various observed effects. They
may be of any order of existence. We give a physical form and name to a
bell but not to its tone, though in each case we know nothing but our
own impressions. But we record musical sounds by a spécial convention.
We may therefore call a certain set of qualities “Ratziel”, or describe
an impression as “Saturnian” without pretending to know what anything is
in itself. Ail we need is to know how to cast a bell that will please
our ears, or how to evoke a “spirit” that will tell us things that are
hidden from our intellectual faculties.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Every object soever may be considered as possessed of an “Astral
shape”, sensible to our subtle perceptions. This “astral shape” is to
its material basis as our human character is to our physical appearance.
We may imagine this astral shape: e.g. we may “see” a jar of opium as a
soft seductive woman with a cruel smile, just as we see in the face of a
cunning and dishonest man the features of some animal, such as a
fox.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>See Poincaré’s essay on the Nature of Space, as an idea invented by
ourselves to measure the resuit of, and explain, our muscular
movements.</li>
</ol>
<p>248 —</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>We may select any particular property of any object, and give it
an astral shape. Thus, we may take the tricky périls of a mountain, and
personify them as “trolls”, or the destructive énergies of the simoom,
as “jinn”.</p></li>
<li><p>We may analyse any of these symbols, obtaining a finer formj thus
the “spirit” contains an “angel”, the angel an “archangel”,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>We may synthesize any set of symbols, obtaining a more general
form. Thus we may group various types of earth-spirit as
gnomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Ail these may be attributed to the Tree of Life, and dealt with
accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>The Magician may préparé a sensible body for any of these
symbols, and evoke them by the proper rites.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>The “reality” or “objectivity” of these symbols is not</li>
</ol>
<p>pertinent to the discussion. The ideas of X 4 and /— 1 hâve proved
useful to the progress of mathematical advance toward Truth 5 it is no
odds whether a Fourth Dimension “exists”, or</p>
<p>whether /— 1 ha s “meaning” in the sense that  has, the number of
umts in the side of a square of 4 units.</p>
<p>The Astral Plane — real or imaginary — is a danger to any- body who
takes it without the grain of sait contained in the Wisdom of the above
point of view; who violâtes its laws, either wilfully, carelessly,
ignorantly, or by presuming that their psycho- logical character
differentiates them from physical laws in the narrower sense; or who
abdicates his autonomy, on the ground that the subtler nature of astral
phenomena guarantees their autho- rity and integrity.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>The variety of the general character of the “planes” of being is
indefinitely large. But there are several main types of symbolism
corresponding to the forms of plastic présentation established by the
minds of Mankind. Each such “plane” has its spécial appearances,
inhabitants, and laws — spécial cases of the general proposition.
Notable among these are the “Egyptian” plane, which conforms with the
ideas and methods of magick once in vogue in the Nile valley; the
“Celtic” plane, close akin to</li>
</ol>
<p>249</p>
<p>“Fairyland”, with a Pagan Pantheism as its keynote, sometimes
concealed by Christian nomenclature: the “Alchemical” plane, where the
Great Work is often presented under the form of symbolically constructed
landscapes occupied by quasi-heraldic animais and human types
hieroglyphically distinguished, who carry on the mysterious operations
of the Hermetic Art.</p>
<p>There are also “planes” of Parable, of Fable, and of Folk-lore; in
short, every country, creed, and literature has given its character-
istic mode of présentation to some “plane” or other.</p>
<p>But there are “planes” proper to every clairvoyant who explores the
Astral Light without préjudice; in such case, things assume the form of
his own mind, and his perception will be clear in proportion to his
personal purity.</p>
<p>On the higher planes, the diversity of form, due to grossness, tends
to disappear. Thus, the Astral Vision of “Isis” is utterly unlike that
of “Kali”. The one is of Motherhood and Wisdom, ineffably candid, clear,
and loving; the other of Murder and madness, blood-intoxicated,
lust-befogged, and cruel. The sole link is the Woman-symbol. But whoso
makes Samadhi on Kali obtains the self-same Illumination as if it had
been Isis; for in both cases he attains identity with the Quintessence
of the Woman- Idea, untrammelled by the qualities with which the
dwellers by the Nile and the Ganges respectively disguised it.</p>
<p>Thus, in low grades of initiation, dogmatic quarrels are inflamed by
astral expérience; as when Saint John distinguishes between the Whore
Babalon and the Woman clothed with the Sun, between the Lamb that was
slain and the Beast 666 whose deadly wound was healed; nor understands
that Satan, the Old Serpent, in the Abyss, the Lake of Fire and Sulphur,
is the Sun-Father, the vibration of Life, Lord of Infinité Space that
fiâmes with His Consuming Energy, and is also that throned Light whose
Spirit is suffused throughout the City of Jewels.</p>
<p>Each “plane” is a veil of the one above it; the original individual
Ideas become diversified as they express their éléments. Two men with
almost identical ideas on a subject would Write two totally different
treatises upon it.</p>

<li>The general control of the Astral Plane, the ability to find</li>
</ol>
<p>— 250 —</p>
<p>one’s way about it, to penetrate such sanctuaries as are guarded from
the profane, to make such relations with its inhabitants as may avail to
acquire knowledge and power, or to command service 5 ail this is a
question of the general Magical attainment of the student.</p>
<p>He must be absolutely at ease in his Body of Light, and hâve made it
invulnérable. He must be adept in assuming ali God- forms, in using ail
weapons, sigils, gestures, words, and signs. He must be familiar with

<li>Every Magician possesses an Astral Universe peculiar to himself,
just as no man’s expérience of the world is conterminous with that of
another. There will be a general agreement on the main points, of course
; and so the Master Therion is able to describe the principal properties
of these “planes”, and their laws, just as he might Write a geography
giving an account of the Five Continents, the Océans and Seas, the most
notable mountains and rivers; he could not prétend to put forth the
whole knowledge that any one peasant possesses in respect of his
district. But, to the peasant, these petty details are precisely the
most important items in his daily life. Likewise, the Magician will be
grateful to the Master Therion for the Compass that guides him at night,
the Map that extends his compréhension of his country, and shows him how
best he may travel afield, the advice as to Sandals and Staff that make
surer his feet, and the Book that tells him how, splitting open his
rocks with an Hammer, he may be master of their Virgin Gold. But he will

Astral Plane, His Qabalistic discoveries, His instructions in Magick.
They may be correct in the main for most men; yet they cannot be wholly
true for any save Him, even as no two artists can make identical
pictures of the same subject.</p>
<p>More, even in fundamentals, though these things be Truth for ail
Mankind, as we carelessly say, any one particular Magician may be the
one man for whom they are false. May not the flag that seems red to ten
thousand seem green to some one other? Then, every man and every woman
being a Star, that which is green to him is verily green 3 if he consent
to the crowd and call it red, hath he not broken the Staff of Truth that
he leaneth upon?</p>
<p>Each and every man therefore that will be a Magician must explore the
Universe for himself. This is pre-eminently the case in the matter of
the Astral Plane, because the symbols are so sensitive. Nothing is
easier than to suggest visions, or to fashion phantasms to suit one’s
ideas. It is obviously impossible to commimicaîe with an indépendant
intelligence — the one real object of astral research — if one allows
one’s imagination to surround one with courtiers of one’s own création.
If one expects one’s visions to resemble those of the Master Therion,
they are only too likely to do so; and if one’s respect for Him induces
one to accept such visions as authentic, one is being false to one’s
soûl; the visions themselves will avenge it. The true Guide being gone,
the seer will stray into a wilderness of terror where he is tricked and
tortured; he will invoke his idol the Master Therion, and fashion in His
image a frightful phantasm who will mock him in his misery, until his
mind stagger and fall; and, Madness swooping upon his carrion, blast his
eyes with the horror of seeing his Master dissolve into that appalling
hallucination, the “Vision of The Démon Crowley!”</p>
<p>Remember, then, always, but especially when dealing with the Astral
Plane, that man’s breath stirs the Feather of Truth. What</p>
<p>— 252</p>
<p>one sees and hears is “real” in its way, whether it be itself, or,
distorted by one’s desires, or created by one’s personality. There is no
touchstone of truth: the authentic Nakhiel is indistinguishable from the
image of the Magician’s private idea of Nakhiel, so far as he is
concerned. The stronger one is to create, the more readily the Astral
Light responds, and coagulâtes créatures of this kind. Not that such
création is necessarily an errorj but it is another branch of one’s
Work. One cannot obtain outside help from inside sources. One must use
précautions similar to those recommended in the chapter on
Divination.</p>
<p>The Magician may go on for a long lime being fooled and flattered by
the As Irais thaï lie has himself modified or manufacturée!. Their
natural subservienee to himself will please him, poor ape!</p>
<p>They wiîi prétend to show him marvellous my s Sériés, pageants of
heauty and wonder unspeakably splendid; he will incline to accept them
as true, for the very reason that they are images of himself idealized
by imagination.</p>
<p>But his real progress will stop dead. Tliese phantasms will prevent
him from coming into contact with indepen- dent intelligences, from whom
alone he can learn anything new.</p>
<p>He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to
he attaining one initiation after another. His Ego will expand
unchecked, till he seem to himself to hâve heaven at his feet. Yet ail
this will be nothing but his fool’s face of Narcissus smirking up from
the pool that will drown him.</p>
<p>Error of this kind on the Astral Plane — in quite ordinary visions
with no apparent moral import — may lead to the most serious mischief.
Firstly, mistakes mislead; to pollute one 7 s view of Jupiter by
permitting the influence of Venus to distort it may end in finding
oneself at odds with Jupiter, later on, in some crisis of one’s
work.</p>
<p>Secondly, the habit of making mistakes and leaving them uncorrected
grows upon one. He who begins by “spelling Jeheshua with a ’Resh ?” may
end by writing the name of the Dweller on the Threshold by mistake for
that of his Angel.</p>
<p>— 253 —</p>
<p>Lastly, Magick is a Pyramid, built layer by layer. The work of the
Body of Light — with the technique of Yoga — is the foundation of the
whole. One’s appréhension of the Astral Plane must be accurate, for
Angels, Archangels, and Gods are derived therefrom by analysis. One must
hâve pure materials if one wishes to brew pure beer.</p>
<p>If one hâve an incomplète and incorrect view of the uni verse, how
can one find out its laws?</p>
<p>Thus, original omission or error tends to extend to the higher
planes. Suppose a Magician, invoking Sol, were persuaded by a plausible
spirit of Saturn that he was the Solar Intelligence required, and bade
him eschew human love if he would attain to the Knowledge and
Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel; and suppose that his will, and
that AngePs nature, were such that the Crux of their Formula was Lyrical
Exaltation!</p>
<p>Apart from the regular tests —- made at the time — of the integrity
of any spirit, the Magician must make a careful record of every vision,
omitting no detail ; he must then make sure that it tallies in every
point with the correspondences in Book 777 and in Liber D. Should he
find (for instance) that, having invoked Mercury, his vision contains
names whose numbers are Martial, or éléments proper to Pisces, let him
set himself most earnestly to discover the source of error, to correct
it, and to prevent its récurrence.</p>
<p>But these tests, as implied above, will not serve to detect
personation by self-suggested phantasms. Unless one’s aura be a welter
of muddled symbols beyond récognition, the more auto- hypnotic the
vision is, the more smoothly it satisfies the seer’s standards. There is
nothing to puzzle him or oppose him; so he spins out his story with
careless contempt of criticism. He can always prove himself right; the
Qabalah can always be stretched; and Red being so nearly Orange, which
is really a shade of Yellow, and Yellow a component of Green which
merges into Blue, what harm if a Fiend in Vermilion appears instead of
an Angel in Azuré?</p>
<p>The true, the final test, of the Truth of one’s visions is their
Value. The most glorious expérience on the Astral plane, let it dazzle
and thrill as it may, is not necessarily in accordance with</p>
<ul>
<li>254</li>
</ul>
<p>the True WiJl of the seer; if not, though it be never so true
objectively, it is not true for him, because not useful for him. (Said
we not a while ago that Truth was no more than the Most Convenient
Manner of Statement?)</p>
<p>. ^ ma y intoxicate and exalt the Seer, it may inspire and fortify
him in every way, it may throw light upon most holy mysteries, yet
withal be no more than an interprétation of the individual to himself,
the formula not of Abraham but of Onan.</p>
<p>These plastic “Portraits of the Artist as a Young Man” are well
enough for those who hâve heard “Know Thyself”. They are necessary,
even, to assist that analysis of one’s nature which the Probationer of
A.-. A.*, is sworn to accomplish. But “Love is the Law, love under
Will”. And Our Lady Nuit is “divided for love s sake, for the chance of
union.” These mirror-mirages are therefore not Works of Magick,
according to the Law of</p>
<p>Thelema. the true Magick of Horus requires the passionate union of
opposites.</p>
<p>Now the proof that one is in contact with an independent entity
dépends on a sensation which ought to be unmistakeable if one is in good
health. One ought not to be liable to mistake one’s own sensible
impressions for somebody else’s! It is only Man’s incurable vanity that
makes the Astral “Strayed Reveller” or the</p>
<p>mystic confuse his own drunken babble with the voice of the Most
High.</p>
<p>The essence of the righî sensation consists in récognition of the
reality of the other Seing. There will be as a rule some element of
hostility, even when the reaction is sympathetic. One s soul-mate”
(even) is not thonight of as oneself, at first contact.</p>
<p>One must therefore insist that any real appearance on the Astral
Plane gives the sensation of meeting a stranger. One must accept it as
independent, be it Archangel or Elf, and measure one’s own reaction to
it. One must learn from it, though one despise it; and love it, however
one loathe it.</p>
<p>One must realize, on wnting up the record, that the meeting has
effected a definite change in oneself. One must hâve known and felt
something a lien, and not merely tried on a new dress.</p>
<p>255 —</p>
<p>There must always be some slight pang of pain in a true Astral Vision
; it hurts the Self to hâve to admit the existence of a not- Self ; and
it taxes the brain to register a new thought. This is true at the first
touch, even when exaltation and stimulation resuit from the joy of
making an agreeable contact.</p>
<p>There is a deeper eiïect of right reaction to a strange Self: the
impact invariably tends to break up some complex in the Seer. The class
of ideas concerned has always been tied up, labelled, and put away. It
is now necessary to unpack it, and rearrange its contents. At least, the
annoyance is like that of a man who has locked and strapped his bag for
a journey, and then finds that he has forgotten his pyjamas. At most, it
may revolutionise his ideas of the business, like an old bachelor with
settled plans of life who meets a girl once too often.</p>
<p>Any really first-class Astral Vision, even on low planes, should
therefore both instruct the Seer, and préparé him for Initiation. Those
failing to pass this test are to be classed as “practice”.</p>
<p>One ïast observation seems fit. We mnst not assert tiie “reality” or
“objeclivity ’ of an Astral Being on no better evidence than the
subjective sensation of its independent existence. We must insist on
proof patent to ali qualified observers if we are to establish the major
premiss of Religion: that there exists a Conscious Intelligence
independent of brain and nerve as we know them. If it hâve also Power,
so mueh the better. But we already know of inorganic forces; we hâve no
evidence of inorganic conscious Mind.</p>
<p>How can the Astral Plane help us here? It is not enough to prove, as
we easily do, the correspondences between Invocation and Apparition  We
must exclude coincidence 1 2 , telepathy 3 , and subconscious knowledge.

<li>The Master Therion’s regular test is to Write the name of a Force on
a card, and conceal it; invoke that Force secretly, send His pupil on

upon it.</li>

<p>must convey a Iruth not known to any human mind, past or présent. Yet
this Truth must be vérifiable.</p>
<p>There îs but one document in the world which présents evidence that
fui]y satisfies these conditions. This is</p>
<p>LIBER AL vel LEGIS</p>
<p>the Book of the Law</p>
<p>of this New Aeon of Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child, the Aeon
whose Logos is The Beast 666, whose name in the Outer Order was Frater
Perdurabo.</p>
<p>The nature of the proof of the separate existence of praeter- human
Intelligence, independent of bodily form, is extremely complicated. Its
main divisions may be briefly enumerated.</p>
<p>He telephoned a friend named Feilding at the latter’s house, and was
answered b)’ Mr. Feilding’s secretary, who said that his employer had
left the house a few minutes previously, and could only be reached by
telephoning a certain office in the City at between 11 o’clock and a
quarter past. Frater Perdurabo had an appointment at il o’clock with a
music-hall star, the place being the entrance to a theatre. In order to
remind himself, he made a mental note that as soon as he saw the lady,
he would raise his hand and say, before greeting her : “Remind me that I
must téléphoné at once to Feilding”, when he met her. He did this, and
she advanced toward Plim with the same gesture, and said in the same
breath, “Remind me that I hâve to téléphoné to Tom Jones” —the name of a
music-hall agent employed by her.</p>
<p>It will be seen that there is here no question of any connection
between the éléments of the coincidence. If a similar occurrence had
taken place in the course of communication with an alleged spirit, it
would hâve been regarded as furnishing a very high degree of proof of
the existence of an independent intelligence.</p>
<p>To make this clear, Jet me substitute the terms of the équation.
Suppose two independent médiums, A and B, were to receive respectively
at the same moment two messages, the first; “Ask B who wrote Hamlet”,
the second; “Ask A the name of Shakespeare’s most famous tragedy.” The
coincidence is here much simpler and less striking than the one recorded
above, for there is no question of arriving at the identity by way of
accidentai synonyms concealing their rational connection. Yet most
students of Occult phenomena would admit that there was a strong
presumption that a single intelligence had deliberately devised the two
messages as a means of proving his existence.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In The International of November, 1918, was published the con-</li>
</ol>
<p>— 257 —</p>
<p>AIWAZ, the name of the Intelligence in question, proves:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>His power to pre-arrange events unconnected with His scribe so that
they should fit in with that scribe’s private calculations.</li>
</ol>
<p>E. g. The Stélé which reveals the Theogony of the Book was cfficially
numbered 666, in the Boulak Muséum. The scribe had adopted 666 as His
magical number, many years previously. Again, the scribe’s magical
House, bought years earlier, had a name whose value was 418. The scribe
had calculated 418 as the</p>
<p>clusion of an article callecl “The Revival of Magick” by the Master
Therion. The last sentence reads: “Herein is Wisdom; let him that hath
understanding count the number of the Beast; for it is the number of a
man; and his number is six hundred and three score and six. TO ME! A 0
HPION, the Great Wild Beast, has the value, according to the Greek
System, of 666. It is, of course, the title of the Master Therion.</p>
<p>The Master H herion was, about this time, in communication with an
intelligence who gave the name of Amalantrah. On Sunday, February 24,
1918, at 9 * 3 ° P* m -, The Master Therion asked Amalantrah if he could
use the Word OHPION as if it were Hebrew, with the idea of gettins;
further information as to the mystic meaning of the Word. The answer was
“Yes”. He then asked: “Am I to take the Word OHPION alone, or the three
words TO META OHPÏON ?” The answer was to take the word OHPION alone.
The Master Therion then asked what Hebrew letters should be used to
transliterate the Greek. The answer was: “Tau, Yod, Resh, Yod, Ayin,
Nun”, which adds to 740 or 1390, according as Nun is given its ordinary
value of 50, or its value as the final letter of a Word, 700. Neither of
these numbers possessed any spécial signihcance to The Master Therion.
He became very annoyed at Amalantrah’s faiîure to be of use; so much so
that the communications became confused, and the work had to be
abandoned for that evening. He tried various other Hebrew spellings for
the word 0 H PION, but was unable to obtain anything of interest. This
is rather remarkable, as it is nearly always possible to get more or
less good results by trying various possibilités. For example, the O
might be equally well Ayin, Vau or Aleph.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, The Master Therion went to the office of The
International , of which he was editor. At this period there was a coal
famine in New York, and it was forbidden to heat office buildings on
Mondays. He merely took away his mail and went home. O11 Tuesday morning
He found on his desk a letter which had arrived on Monday for the
general editor, who had sent it across to Him for reply, as it concerned
The Master Therion rather than himself. This letter had been written and
posted on Sunday evening, at about the same time</p>
<p>— 258 —</p>
<p>number of the Great Work, in 1901 e.v. He only discovered that 418
was the number of his house in conséquence of AIWAZ mentioning the
fact.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>His power to conceal a cohérent System of numbers and letters in the
text of a rapidly-written document, containing ridelles and ciphers
opening to a Master-Key unknown to the scribe, yet linked with his own
System ; this Key and its subordi - nates being moreover a comment on
the text.</li>
</ol>
<p>as the communication from Amalantrah. The letter ends as fallows:
“Please inform your readers that I, Samuel bar Aiwaz bie Yackou de</p>
<p>Sherabad, hâve counted the number of the Beast, and it is the number
of a man.</p>

<p>/p 1 r • , , , , N O I R Th</p>
<p>(Read from nght to left) 50 6 10 200 400</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>Ileie, then, we see the most striking solution possible of the
problem presented to Amalantrah. Observe that Amalantrah had refused to
give the correct solution directly; as it would seem, in order to
emphasize the remarkable character of the intervention of this Assynan
correspondent. Observe, too, that the latter was totally ignorant of the
ordinary Qabalah, it being quite generally known that TO META OHPIONadds
up to 666 in Greek. Observe, moreover, that nearly four months had
passed since the problem was propounded in The International? The
Assyrian lived some distance outside New York, and was an entire
stranger to any of the staff of 7 he International. The evidence appears
overwAelming for the existence or Amalantrah, that he was more expert in
the Qabalah than The Master Therion himself, and that he v/as (further)
possessed with the power to recail this four-months~old problem to the
mind of an entirely unconnected stranger, causing him to communicate the
correct answer at the same moment as the question v/as being asked many
miles away.</p>
<p>Coincidence, so completely adéquate to explain the Fielding-Tom Jones
incident, is utterly incompetent as an alternative theory. The directly
purposeful character of the circumstances is undeniable; but if we are
resolutely determined to deny the possibility of the existence of
Amalantrah, which explains the whole affair so simply, we hâve still one
resource. It involves difficultés which The Master Therion cannot
conceive as less than those which encumber the other, but it is, at
least,</p>
<p>259</p>
<p>E. g. “The Word of the Law is 0 EAHMA” (Will) ; this Word has the
value of 93.</p>
<p>“Love is the law, love under will.” Love, Aya-ruy), likeBsXyjua, adds
to 93.</p>
<p>AIWAZ itself adds to 93. 1</p>
<p>This was ail strange to the scribe; yet years later he discovered the
“Lest Word” of one of his own Orders; it was 93 also.</p>
<p>The Word of His most holy Order proved equally to count up</p>
<p>not entirely beyond possibility. This theory is telepathy. One may
postulate that the solution of his problem existed in the subconscious
minci of the Master Therion or in that of His seer, and that this
solution was telepathi- cally impressed upon the consciousness of the
Assyrian so forcibly as to impel him to communicate it to the Master
Therion’s colîeague on The International. Apart from the general
improbability of this hypothesis, it is strange that if “Amalantrah”
were really the subconscious mind of the seer, he should hâve given a
wrong orthography. His doing so (if he knew the correct spelling) is
only explicable by his wish not to take the edge off his plan for making
the Assyrian’s letter a fulminating révélation of his existence, as
would hâve happened if the secret had been prematurely disclosed.</p>
<p>The case is here cited in order to illustrate the extreme care which
ought to be taken in excluding ail alternative hypothèses before
admitting the existence of disembodied intelligences. It may be
mentioned, however, that in this particular case there are numerous
other incidents which make the télépathie theory untenable.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>There is a well-known story quoted in several treatises of
psychology in which the heroine is an ignorant English servant girl of
quite inferior intelligence, and unacquainted with any language, even
her own. In the course of a fever, she became delirious, and proceeded
to reel off long passages of scholarly Hebrew. Investigations showed
that in her hrst youth she had been for a time in the service of a
Jewish Rabbi who had been accustomed to declaim his sermons in the
hearing of the girl. Although attaching no meaning to the words, she had
stored them mechanically in her subconscious memory, to be reproduced
when the action of the fever excited the group of cells where they were
recorded.</li>
</ol>
<p>I. This numération was discovered years later. The question then
arose out of considération of this discovery through S. Jacobs: “Why is
Aiwaz spelt Aiwass, not Aiwaz, in the Book of the Law?” In Greek AiJF

orve only but two numbers, those of suprême importance in the Book.</p>
<p>— 260 —</p>
<p>to 93. 1 Now 93 is thrice 31 ; 31 is LA, “Not” and AL, “The” or
“God”; these words run throughout the Book, giving a double meaning to
many passages. A third 31 is the compound letter ShT, the two
hieroglyphs of Sh and T (many centuries old) being pictures of the
“Dramatis Personæ” of the Book; and ShT being a haphazard line scrawled
on the MS. touch letters which added to 418, valuing “this circle
squared in its failure” as tc correct to six places of décimais,

was to be the “child” of the scribe, “and that strangely”.</p>
<p>Nine months after The Beast 666 had gotten a Magical “child” upon His
concubine Jane Foster, a “Babe of the Abyss” was born, Frater Achad
asserting his right to that grade, and thus “coming after” The Beast
666, who had been the last Adept to do so. And this “child” was
definitely “one”, since “one” is the meaning of his motto Achad.

<p>Verily and Amen! Let not the Magician forget for a single second what

it) is a mob of wild women, hysterical from uncomprehended and unsated
animal instinct ; they will tear Pentheus, the merely human king who

Nature, the first to claw at his windpipe! None but Bacchus, the Holy
Guardian Angel, hath grâce to be God to this riot of maniacs; he alone
can transform the disorderly rabble into a pageant of harmonious
movements, tune their hyaena howls to the symphony of a paean, and their
reasonless rage to self-controlled rapture. It is this Angel whose
nature is doubly double, that He may partake of every sacrament. He is
at once a God who is drunken with the wine of earth, and the mammal who
quaffs the Blood of God to purge him of mortality. He is a woman as he
accepts ail impulses, are they not His? He is a man to stamp Himself

<p>Let the Magician therefore adventure himself upon the Astral Plane
with the declared design to penetrate to a sanctuary of discarnate
Beings such as are able to instruct and fortify him, also to prove their

<p>He who would reach Intelligences of the type under discussion may
expect extreme difficulty. The paths are guarded; there is a lion in the
way. Technical expertness will not serve here; it is necessary to
satisfy the Warders of one’s right to enter the presence of the Master.
Particular pledges may be demanded, ordeals imposed, and initiations
conferred. These are most serious matters; the Body of Light must be
fully adult, irrevocably fixed, or it will be disintegrated at the
outset. But, being fit to pass through such expériences, it is bound
utterly to its words and acts. It cannot even appear to break an oath,
as its fleshly fellow may do.</p>
<p>Such, then is a general description of the Astral Plane, and of the
proper conduct of the Magician in his dealings therewith.</p>

<p>ARS CONGRESSUS CUM DAEMONE.</p>
<p>S®clion A Let the Adeptus Minor be standing in this</p>
<p>circle on the square of Tiphereth, armed with his Wand and Cup; but
let him perform the Ritual throughout in his Body of Light. He may burn
the Cakes of Light, or the Incense of Abramelin; he may be prepared by
Liber CLXXV, the reading of Liber LXV, and by the practices of Yoga. He
may invoke HADIT by a wine and strange drugs 5 ’ if he so will. 1 He
préparés the circle by the usual formulæ of Banishing and Consécration,
etc.</p>
<p>He recites Section A as a rehearsal before His Holy Guardian Angel of
the attributes of that Angel. Each phrase must be realized with full
concentration of force, so as to make Samadhi as perfectly as possible
upon the truth proclaimed.</p>
<p>Line i He identifies his Angel with the Ain Soph, and</p>
<p>the Kether thereof; one formulation of Hadit in the boundless Body of
Nuith.</p>
<p>Lines 2, 3, 4 He asserts that His Angel has created (for the</p>
<p>purpose of self-realisation through projection in conditioned Form)
three pairs of opposites: (a) The Fixed and the Volatile; (b) The
Unmani- fested and the Manifest; and (c) the IJnmoved and the Moved.
Otherwise, the Négative and the Positive in respect of Matter, Mind and
Motion.</p>
<p>Line 5 He acclaims his Angel as “Himself Made</p>
<p>Perfect”; adding that this Individuality is inscrut- able and
inviolable. In the Néophyte Ritual of</p>

<p>G. D.*. (as it is printed in Equinox I, II, for the old aeon) the
Hierophant is the perfected Osiris, who brings the candidate, the
natural Osiris, to identity with himself. But in the new Aeon the
Hierophant is Horus (Liber CCXX, I 49) therefore the Candidate will be
Horus too. What then is the formula of the initiation of Horus ? It will
no longer be that of the Man, through Death. It will be the natural
growth of the Child. His expériences will no more be regarded as
catastrophic. Their hieroglyph is the Pool: the innocent and impotent
Harpocrates Babe becomes the Horus Adult by obtaining the Wand. “Der
reine Thor” seizes the Sacred Lance. Bacchus becomes Pan. The Holy Guar¬
dian Angel is the Unconscious Créature Self — the Spiritual Phallus. His
knowledge and Conversa¬ tion contributes occult puberty. It is therefore
advisable to replace the name Asar Un-nefer by that of Ra-Hoor-Khuit at
the outset, and by that of one’s own Holy Guardian Angel when it has
been communicated.</p>
<p>He hails Him as BESZ, the Matter that destroys and devours Godhead,
for the purpose of the Incarnation of any God.</p>
<p>He hails Him as APOPHRASZ, the Motion that destroys and devours
Godhead, for the pur¬ pose of the Incarnation of any God. The combined
action of these two DEVILS is to allow the God upon whom they prey to
enter into enjoyment of existence through the Sacrament of dividual
“Life” (Bread — the flesh of BESZ) and “Love” (Wine — the blood or venom
of APOPHRASZ).</p>
<p>He acclaims His Angel as having “eaten of the Fruit of the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil”; otherwise, having become wise (in the</p>
<p>275 —</p>
<p>Line 9</p>
<p>Line 10</p>
<p>Line 11</p>
<p>Section Aa. Line 1</p>
<p>Dyad, Chokmah) to apprehend the formula of Equilibrium which is now
His own, being able to apply Himself accurately to His self-appointed
environment.</p>
<p>He acclaims His Angel as having laid down the Law of Love as the
Magical formula of the Universe, that He may résolve the phénoménal
again into its noumenal phase by uniting any</p>
<p>two opposites in ecstasic passion.</p>
<p>He acclaims His Angel as having appointed that this formula of Love
should effect not only the dissolution of the separateness of the Lovers
into His own impersonal Godhead, but their co-ordina¬ tion in a “Child”
quintessentializea from its parents to constitute a higher order of
Being than theirs, so that each génération is an alchemical progress
towards perfection in the direction of successive complexities. As Line
9 asserts Invoiu- tion, Line 10 asserts Evolution.</p>
<p>He acclaims His Angel as having devised this method of
self-realization ; the object of Incarna¬ tion is to obtain its
reactions to its relations with other incarnated Beings and to observe
theirs with each other.</p>
<p>The Adept asserts his right to enter into conscious communication
with His Angel, on the ground that that Angel has Himself taught him the
Secret Magick by which he may make the proper link. “Mosheh” is M H, the
formation, in Jechidah, Chiah, Neschamah, Ruach, — the Sephi- roth from
Kether to Yesod — since 45 is L 1-9 while Sh, 300, is L 1-24, which
superadds to these Nine an extra Fifteen numbers. (See in Liber D</p>
<p>276 —</p>
<p>Line 2</p>
<p>Line 3</p>
<p>Section B</p>
<p>the meanings and correspondences of 9, 15, 24, 45, 300, 345 -)</p>
<p>45 is moreover A D M, man. “Mosheh” is thus the name cf man as a
God-concealing Form. But in the Ritual let the Adept replace this
“Mosheh” by his own motto as Adeptus Minor. For “Ish- rael” let him
prefer his own Magical Race, according to the obligations of his Oaths
to Our Holy Order! (The Beast 666 Himself used “Ankh-f-n-khonsu” and a
Khem” in this section.)</p>
<p>The Adept reminds his Angel that He has created That One Substance of
which Hermes hath written in the Table of Emerald, whose virtue is to
unité in itself ail opposite modes of Being, thereby to serve as a
Talisman charged with the Spiritual Energy of Existence, an Elixir or
Stone composed of the physical basis of Life. This Commémoration is
placed between the two Per¬ sonal appeals to the Angel, as if to claim
privilège to partake of this Eucharist which createth, sus- taineth and
redeemeth ail things.</p>
<p>He now asserts that he is himself the “Angel” or messenger of his
Angel 5 that is, that he is a mind and body whose office is to receive
and transmit the Word of his Angel. He hails his Angel not only as
“un-nefer” the Perfection of “Asar” himself as a man, but as
Ptah-Apophrasz- Ra, the identity (Hadit) wrapped in the Dragon (Nuith)
and thereby manifested as a Sun (Ra- Hoor-Khuit). The “Egg” (or Heart)
“girt with a Serpent” is a cognate symbole the idea is thus expressed
later in the ritual. (See Liber LXV. which expands this to the
uttermost.)</p>
<p>The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the sections now
following B to Gg. He is tô travel astrally around the circle, making
the appro- priate pentagrams, sigils, and signs. His direction</p>
<p>— 277 —</p>
<p>is widdershins. He thus makes three curves, each covering
three-fourths of the circle. He should give the sign of the Enterer on
passing the Kiblah, or Direction of Boleskine. This picks up the Force
naturally radiating from that point 1 and projects it in the direction
of the path of the Magician. The sigils are those given in the Equinox
Vol. I, No. 7, Plate X outside the square 5 the signs those shewn in
Vol. I, No. 2, Plate “The Signs of the Grades”. In these invocations he
should expand his girth and his stature to the utmost 2 , assuming the
form and the consciousness of the Elemental God of the quarter. After
this, he begins to vibrate the “Barbarous Names” of the Ri tuai.</p>
<p>Now let him not only fill his whole being to the uttermost with the
force of the Names; but let him formulate his Will, understood
thoroughly as the dynamic aspect of his Creative Self, in an appearance
symbolically apt, I say not in the form of a Ray of Light, of a Fiery
Sword, or of aught save that bodily Vehicle of the Holy Ghost which is
sacred to BAPHOMET, by its virtue that con- cealeth the Lion and the
Serpent that His Image may appear adorably upon the Earth for ever.</p>
<p>Let then the Adept extend his Will beyond the Circle in this imagined
Shape and let it radiate with the Light proper to the Elément invoked,
and let each Word issue along the Shaft with passionate impulse, as if
its voice gave command thereto that it should thrust itself leapingly
fcrward. Let also each Word accumulate authority, so that the Head of
the Shaft may plunge twice as far for the Second Word as for the First,
and Four Times for</p>

</ol>
<p>278</p>
<p>the Third as the Second, and thus to the end. Moreover, let the Adept
fling forth his whole consciousness thither. Then at the final Word, let
him bring rushing back his Will within himself, steadily streaming, and
let him offer himself to its point, as Artémis to PAN, that this
perfectly pure concentration of the Elément purge him tho- roughly, and
possess him with its passion.</p>
<p>In this Sacrament being wholly at one with that Elément, let the
Adept utter the Charge “Hear me, and make”, etc. with strong sense that
this unity with that quarter of the Universe confers upon him the
fullest freedom and privilège appurtenant thereto.</p>
<p>Let the Adept take note of the wording of the Charge. The “Firmament”
is the Ruach, the “mental plane” ; it is the realm of Shu, or Zeus,
where revolves the Wheel of the Gunas, the Three forms 1 of Being. The

Sattvas, Rajas, and Tamas in the Hindu System; and are rather modes of
action than actual qualities even when conceived as latent. They are the
apparatus of communication between the planes; as such, they are
conventions. There is no absolute validity in any means of mental
appréhension; but unless we make these spirits of the Firmament subject
unto us by establishing right relation (within the possible limits) with
the Universe, we shall fall into error when we develop our new
instrument of direct understanding. It is vital that the Adept should
train his inteilectual faculties to tell him the truth, in the measure
of their capacity. To despise the mind on account of its limitations is
the most disastrous blunder; it is the common cause of the calamities
which strew so many shores with the wreckage of the Mystic Armada.
Bigotry, Arrogance, Éewilderment, ail fcrms of mental and moral
disorder, so often observed in people of great spiritual attainment,
hâve brought the Path ’tself into discrédit; almost ail such
catastrophes are due to trying to build the Temple of the Spirit without
proper attention to the mental laws of structure and the physical
necessities of foundation. The mind must be brought to its utmost pitch
of perfection, but according to its own internai properties; one cannot
feed a microscope on mutton chops. It must be regarded as a
mechanical</p>
<p>— 279 —</p>
<p>“akasha”, the “Spirit”, the Aethyr or physics, which is the framework
on which ail forms are founded; it receives, records and transmits ail
impulses without itself suffering mutation thereby. The “Earth” is the
sphere wherein the operation of these “fundamental” and aethvric forces
appears to perception. “Under the Earth” is the World of those phenomena
which inform those perceived projections, and détermine their particular
char- acter. “Dry land” is the place of dead “material things”, dry
(i.e. unknowable) because unable to act on our minds. “Water” is the
vehicle whereby we feel such things; “air” their menstruum wherein these
feelings are mentally apprehended. It is called “whirling” because of
the instability of thought, and the fatuity of reason, on which we are
yet dépendent for what we call “life”, “Rush- ing Fire” is the world in
which wandering thought burns up to swift-darting Will. These four
stages explain how the non-Ego is transmuted intc the</p>
<p>instrument of knowledge, independent of the personality of its
possessor. One must treat it exactly as one treats one’s electroscope or
one’s eyes; one influence of one’s wishes. A physician calls in a
colleague to attend to his own family, knowing that personal anxiety may
dérangé his judgment. A microscopist who trusts his eyes when his pet
theory is at stake may falsify the facts, and find too late that he has
made a fool of himself.</p>
<p>In the case of initiation itself, history is scarred with the wounds
inflicted by this Dagger. It reminds us constantly of the danger of
relying upon the intellectual faculties. A judge must know the law in
every point, and be detached from personal préjudices, and
incorruptible, or iniquity will triumph. Dogma, with persécution,
delusion, paralysis of progress, and many another evil, as its satraps,
has always estabîished a tyranny when Genius has proclaimed it. Islam
making a bonfire of written Wisdom, and Haerkel forging biological
evidence; physicists ignorant of radioactivity disputing the conclusions
of geology, and theologians impatient of truth struggling against the
tide of thought; ail such must perish at the hands of their own error in
making their minds, internally defective or externally deflected, the
measure of the Universe.</p>
<p>— 280 —</p>
<p>Ego. A &lt;: Spell” of God is any form of conscious- ness, and a
“Scourge” any form of action.</p>
<p>The Charge, as a whole, demands for the Adept the control of every
detail of the Universe which His Angel has created as a means of
manifesting Himself to Himself. It covers command of the primary
projection of the Possible in individuality, in the antithetical
artifice which is the device of Mind, and in a balanced triplicity of
modes or States of being whose combinations constitute the
characteristics of Cosmos. It includes also a standard of structure, a
rigidity to make reference possible. Upon these foundations of condition
which are not things in themselves, but the canon to which things
conform, is builded the Temple of Being, whose materials are themselves
perfectly mysterious, inscrutable as the Soûl, and like the Soûl
imagining themselves by symbols which we may feel, perceive, and adapt
to our use without ever knowing the whole Truth about them. The Adept
sums up ail these items by claiming authority over every form of
expression possible to Exis¬ tence, whether it be a “spell” (idea) or a
“scourge” (act) of “God”, that is, of himself. The Adept must accept
every “spirit”, every “spell”, every “scourge”, as part of his
environment, and make them ail “subject to” himself ; that is, consider
them as contributory causes of himself. They hâve made him what he is.
They correspond exactly to his own faculties. They are ail — ultimately
— of equal importance. The fact that he is what he is proves that each
item is equilibrated. The impact of each new impression affects the
entire System in due measure. He must thereiore realize that every event
is subject to him. It occurs because he had need of it. Iron rusts
because the molécules demand oxygen for the satisfaction ©f</p>

<p>their tendencies. They do not crave hydrogen; therefore combination
with that gas is an event which does not happen. Ail expériences
contribute to make us complété in ourselves. We feel our- selves subject
to them so long as we fail to recognise this; when we do, we perceive
that they are subject to us. And whenever we strive to évadé an
expérience, whatever it may be, we thereby do wrong to ourselves. We
thwart our own tendencies. To live is to change; and to oppose change is
to revoit against the law which we hâve enacted to govern our lives. To
resent destiny is thus to abdicate our sovereignty, and to invoke death.
Indeed, we hâve decreed the doom of death for every breach of the law of
life. And every failure to incorporate any impression starves the
particular faculty which stood in need of it.</p>
<p>This Section B invokes Air in the East, with a shaft of golden
glory.</p>
<p>The adept now invokes Fire in the South; flamc red are the rays that
burst from his Verendum.</p>
<p>He invokes Water in the West, his Wand billowing forth blue
radiance.</p>
<p>He goes to the North to invoke Earth; flowers of green flame flash
from his weapon. As practice makes the Adept perfect in this Work, it
becomes automatic to attach ail these complicated ideas and intentions
to their correlated words and acts. When this is attained he may go
deeper into the formula by amplifying its correspondences. Thus, he may
invoke water in the manner of water, extending</p>
<p>— 282 —</p>
<p>Section F.</p>
<p>Section Ff.</p>
<p>his will with majestic and irrésistible motion, mindful of its
impulse gravitation, yet with a suave and tranquil appearance of
weakness. Again, he may apply the formula of water to its peculiar pur-
pose as it surges back into his sphere, using it with conscious skill
for the cleansing and calming of the réceptive and emotional éléments in
his character, and for the solution or sweeping away of those tangled
weeds of préjudice which hamper him from freedom to act as he will.
Similar applica¬ tions of the remaining invocations will occur to the
Adept who is ready to use them.</p>
<p>The Adept now returns to the Tiphereth square of his Tau, and invokes
Spirit, facing toward Boleskine, by the active Pentagrams, the sigil
called the Mark of the Beast, and the Signs of L.V.X. (See plate as
before). He then vibrâtes the Names extending his will in the same way
as before, but vertically upward. At the same time he expands the Source
of that Will — the secret symbol of Self — both about him and below, as
if to affirm that Self, duplex as is its form, reluctant to acquiesce in
its failure to coincide with the Sphere of Nuith. Let him now imagine,
at the last Word, that the Head of his will, where his consciousness is
fixed, opens its fissure (the Brah- marandra-Cakkra, at the junction of
the cranial sutures) and exudes a drop of clear crystalline dew, and
that this pearl is his Soûl, a virgin offering to his Angel, pressed
forth from his being by the intensity of his Aspiration.</p>
<p>With these words the Adept does not withdraw his will within him as
in the previous Sections. He thinks of them as a reflection of Truth on
the</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>Line i. Line 2. Line 3. Line 4.</p>
<p>Section G.</p>
<p>surface of the dew, where his Soûl hides trembling. He takes them to
be the first formulation in his consciousness of the nature of His Holy
Guardian Angel.</p>
<p>The “Gods” include ail the conscious éléments of his nature.</p>
<p>The “Universe” includes ail possible phenomena of which he can be
aware.</p>
<p>The “Winds” are his thoughts, which hâve prevented him from attaining
to his Angel.</p>
<p>His Angel has made “Voice”, the magical weapon which produces
“Words”, and these words hâve been the wisdom by which He hath created
ail things. The “Voice” is necessary as the link between the Adept and
his Angel. The Angel is “King”, the One who “can”, the “source of
author- ity and the fount of honour”; also the King (or King’s Son) who
delivers the Enchanted Princess, and makes her his Queen. He is “Ruler”,
the “unconscious Will”; to be thwarted no more by the ignorant and
capricious false will of the cons¬ cious man. And He is “Helper”, the
author of the infallible impulse that sends the Soûl sweeping along the
skies on its proper path with such impetus that the attraction of alien.
orbs is no longer sufficient to swerve it. The “Hear me” clause is now
uttered by the normal human consciousness, withdrawn to the physical
bodyj the Adept must deliberately abandon his attainment, because it is
not yet his whole being which burns up before the Beloved.</p>
<p>The Adept, though withdrawn, shall hâve maintained the Extension of
his Symbol. He now repeat the signs as before, save that he makes the
Passive Invoking Pentagram of Spirit. He con-</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>centrâtes his consciousness within his Twin-Symbol of Self, and
endeavours to send it to sleep. But if the operation be performed
properly, his Angel shall hâve accepted the offering of Dew, and seized
with fervour upon the extended symbol of Will towards Himself. This then
shall He shake vehementlv with vibrations of love reverberating with the
Words of the Section. Even in the physical ears of the adept there shall
resound an écho thereof, yet he shall not be able to describe it. It
shall seem both louder than thunder, and softer than the whisper of the
night-wind. It shall at once be inarticulate, and mean more than he hath
ever heard.</p>
<p>Now let him strive with ail the strength of his Soûl to withstand the
Will of his Angel, con- cealing himself in the closest cell of the
citadel of consciousness. Let him consecrate himself to resist the
assault of the Voice and the Vibration until his consciousness faint
away into Nothing. For if there abide unabsorbed even one single atom of
the false Ego, that atom should stain the virginity of the True Self and
profane the Oath; then that atom should be so inflamed by the approach
of the Angel that it should overwhelm the rest of the mind, tyrannize
over it, and become an insane despot to the total ruin of the realm.</p>
<p>But, ail being dead to sense, who then is able to strive against the
Angel ? He shall intensify the stress of His Spirit so that His loyal
légions of Lion-Serpents leap from the ambush, awakening the adept to
witness their Will and sweep him with them in their enthusiasm, so that
he consciously partakes their purpose, and sees in its simplicity the
solution of ail his perplexities. Thus then shall the Adept be aware
that he is being swept away through the column of his Will Symbol,</p>
<ul>
<li>285</li>
</ul>
<p>and that His Angel is indeed himself, with inti- macy so intense as
to become identity, and that not in a single Ego, but in every
unconscious element that shares in that manifold uprush.</p>
<p>This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant light, almost
always, and also in many cases by an outburst of sound, stupendous and
sublime in ail cases, though its character may vary within wide limits.
1</p>
<p>The spate of stars shoots from the head of the Will-Symbol, and is
scattered over the sky in glit- tering galaxies. This dispersion
destroys the con¬ centration of the adept, whose mind cannot master such
multiplicity of majesty; as a rule, he simply sinks stunned into
normality, to recall nothing of his expérience but a vague though vivid
impression of complété release and ineffable rapture. Répéti¬ tion
fortifies him to réalisé the nature of his attain* ment 5 and his Angel,
the link once made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be sensitive
to his Holy presence, and persuasion. But it may occur, especially after
repeated success, that the Adept is not flung back into his mortality by
the explosion of the Star-spate, but identified with one particular
“Lion-Serpent”, continuing conscious thereof until it finds its proper
place in Space, when its secret self flowers forth as a truth, which the
Adept may then take back to earth with him.</p>
<p>This is but a side issue. The main purpose of the Ritual is to
establish the relation of the sub- conscious self with the Angel in such
a way that the Adept is aware that his Angel is the Unity which
expresses the sum of the Eléments of that Self, that his normal
consciousness contains alien enemies</p>
<p>I. These phenomena are not wholly subjective; they may be perceived,
though often under other forms, by even the ordinary man.</p>
<p>— 286 —</p>
<p>introduced by the accidents of environment, and that his Knowledge
and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel destroys ail doubts and
delusions, confers ail blessings, teaches ail truth, and containa ail
delights. But it is important that the Adept should not rest in mere
inexpressible realization of his rapture, but rouse himself to make the
relation submit to analysis, to render it in rational terms, and thereby
enlighten his mind and heart in a sense as superior to fanatical
enthusiasm as Beethoven’s music is to West African war-drums.</p>
<p>Section Gg. The adept should hâve realised that his Act</p>
<p>of Union with the angel implies (i) the death of his old mind save in
so far as his unconscious éléments preserve its memory when they absorb
it, and (2) the death of his unconscious elementa themselves. But their
death is rather a going forth to renew their life through love. He then,
by conscious compréhension of them separatefy and together, becomes the
“Angel” of his Angel, as Hermes is the Word of Zeus, whose own voice is
Thunder. Thus in this section the adept utters articulately so far as
words may, what his Angel is to Himself. He says this, with his
Scin-Laeca wholly withdrawn into his physical body, con- straining His
Angel to indwell his heart.</p>
<p>Line 1. “I am He” asserts the destruction of the sense</p>
<p>of separateness between self and Self. It affirms existence, but of
the third person only. “The Bornless Spirit” is free of ail space,
“having sight in the feet”, that they may choose their own path.
“Strong” is G B R, the Magician escorted by the Sun and the Moon (See
Liber D and Liber 777) The “Immortal Fire” is the Creative Self ; imper-
sonal energy cannot perish, no matter what forms it assumes. Combustion
is Love.</p>

<p>“Truth” is the necessary relation of any two things; therefore,
although it implies duality, it enables us to conceive of two things as
being one thing such that it demands to be defined by com- plementals.
Thus, an hyperbola is a simple idea, but its construction exacts two
curves.</p>
<p>The Angel, as the adept knows him, is a being Tiphereth, which
obscures Kether. The Adept is not officially aware of the higher
Sephiroth. He cannot perceive, like the Xpsissimus, that ail things
soever are equally illusion and equally Absolute. He is in Tiphereth,
whose office is Rédemption, and he déplorés the events which hâve caused
the apparent Sorrow from which he has just escaped. He is also aware,
even in the height of his ecstasy, of the limits and defects of his
Attainment.</p>
<p>This refers to the phenomena which accompany his Attainment.</p>
<p>This means the récognition of the Angel as the True Self of his
subconscious self, the hidden Life of his physical life.</p>
<p>The Adept réalisés every breath, everv word of his Angel as charged
with Creative fire. Tiphereth is the Sun, and the Angel is the spiritual
Sun of the Soûl of the Adept.</p>
<p>Here is summed the entire process of bringing the conditioned
Universe to knowledge of itself through the formula of génération 1 ; a
soûl implants itself in sense-hoodwinked body and reason-fettered mind,
makes them aware of their Inmate, and thus to partake of its own
conscious- ness of the Light.</p>

<p>I. That is, Yod Hé realizing Themselves, Will and Undcrstanding, m

written it down for the World, it shall be an ornament for the Adept who
adopts it to cry Hail to His name at the end of his work. This shall
moreover encourage him in Magick, to recall that indeed there was One
who attained by its use to the Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy
Guardian Angel, the which forsook him no more, but made Him a Magus, the
Word of the Aeon of Horus !</p>
<p>For know this, that the Name IAF in its most secret and mighty sense
declareth the Formula of the Magick of the BEAST whereby he wrought many
wonders. And because he doth will that the whole world shall attain to
this Art, He now hideth it herein so that the worthy may win to Elis

<p>But again SA is 61, AIN, the Naught of Nuith; BA means go, for HADIT

throughout in the Light of his personal researches in the Qabalah, and
thus make it his own peculiar property. The spelling here suggested
implies that he who utters the Word affirms his allegiance to the
symbols 93 and 6; that he is a warrior in the army of Will and of the
Sun. 93 is also the number of AIWAZ and 6 of The Beast.</li>

<p>And let him then end ail, saying, Such are the Words ! 1 For b y this
he maketh proclamation before ail them that be about his Circle that
these Words are true and puissant, binding what he would bind, and
loosing what he would loose.</p>
<p>Let the Adept perform this Ritual aright, per- fect in every part
thereof, once daily for one moon, then twice, at dawn and dusk, for two
moons, next, thrice, noon added, for three moons, afterwards, midnight
making up his course, for four moons four times every day. Then let the
Eleventh Moon be consecrated wholly to this Work; let him be instant in
continuai ardour, dismissing ail but his sheer needs to eat and sleep. 2
For know that the true Formula 3 whose virtue sufficed the Beast in this
Attainment, was thus :</p>
<p>INVOKE OFTEN 4</p>
<p>So may ail men corne at last to the Knowledge and Conversation of the
Holy Guardian Angel : thus sayeth the Beast, and prayeth His own Angel
that this book be as a burning Lamp, and as a living Spring, for Light
and Life to them that read therein.</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>!• The consonants of LOGOS, “Word”, add (Hebrew values,) to 93. And
EIIH, “Words”, (whence “Epie”) has also that value: EIAE TA EUH might be
the phrase here intended: its number is 418. This would then assert the
accomplishment of the Great Work; this is the natural conclusion of the
Ritual. Cf. CCXX.III. 75.</p>

<p>The Oracles of Zoroaster utter this :</p>
<p>“And when, by often invoking, ail the phantasms are vanished, thou
shalt see that Holy and Formless Fire, that Fire which darts and flashes
through ail the Depths of the Universe; hear thou the Voice of the
P’ire!</p>
<p>“A similar Fire flashingly extending through the rushings of Air, or
a Fire formless whence cometh the Image of a voice, or even a flashing
Light abounding, revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud. Also there is
the vision of the fire-flashing Courser of Light, or also a Child, borne

<p>POINT</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>SCHOLION ON SECTIONS G &amp; Gg.</p>
<p>The Adept who has mastered this Ritual, successfully realising the
full import of this controlled rapture, ought not to allow his mind to
loosen its grip on the astral imagery of the Star-spate, Will-Symbol, or
Soul-symbol, or even to forget its duty to the body and the sensible
surroundings. Nor should he omit to keep his Body of Light in close
touch with the phenonema of its own plane, so that its privy
consciousness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting his
scattered ideas from obsession.</p>
<p>But he should hâve acquired, by previous practice, the faculty of.
detaching these éléments of his consciousness from their articulate
centre, so that they become (temporarily) independent responsible units,
capable of receiving communications from head- quarters at will, but
perfectly able (i) to take care of themselves without troubling their
chief, and (2) to report to him at the proper time. In a figure, they
must be like subordinate officers, expected to display self-reliance,
initiative, and integrity in the execution of the Orders of the Day.</p>
<p>The Adept should therefore be able to rely on these individual minds
of his to control their own conditions without interférence from himself
for the time required, and to recall them in due course, receiving an
accurate report of their adventures.</p>
<p>This being so, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest
self, that part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon
the realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily,
mental and astral consciousness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is
their usurpation of his attention which has made him deaf to his Soûl,
and his préoccupation with their affairs that has prevented him from
perceiving that Soûl.</p>
<p>— 294 —</p>
<p>The effect of the Ritual has been</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to
distract him;</p></li>
<li><p>to separate them so completely that his soûl is stripped of its
sheaths ;</p></li>
<li><p>to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and
anaesthetize him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of this
spiritual vivisection, just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding
night, in order to brazen out the intensity of shame which so
mysteriously coexists with their desire ;</p></li>
<li><p>to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element,
and fling them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy
Guardian Angel ; and</p></li>
<li><p>to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which
invokes Him.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The method of the Ritual is thus manifold.</p>
<p>There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to
calculate his course of action. He can décidé what must be banished,
what purified, what concentrated. He can then con¬ centrate his will
upon its one essential element, over-coming its résistance — which is
automatic, like a physiological reflex — by destroying inhibitions
through his ego-overwhelming enthusiasm. 1 The other half of the work
needs no such complex effort ; for his Angel is simple and unperplexed,
ready at ail times to respond to rightly ordered approach.</p>
<p>I. A high degree of initiation is required. This means that the
process of analysis must hâve been carried out very thoroughly. The
Adept must hâve become aware of his deepest impulses, and understood
their true significance. The “résistance” here mentioned is automatic;
it increases indefinitely against direct pressure. It is useless to try
to force oneself in these matters; the uninitiated Aspirant, however
eager he may be, is sure to fail. One must know how to deal with each
internai idea as it arises.</p>
<p>It is impossible to overcome one’s inhibitions by conscious effort;
their existence justifies them. God is on their side, as on that of the
victim in Browning’s înstans Tyrannus . A man cannot compel himself to
love, however much he may want to, on various rational grounds. But on
the other hand, when the true impulse cornes, it overwhelms ail its
critics; they are pow r erless either to make or break a genius; it can
only testify to the fact that it has met its master.</p>
<p>295 —</p>
<p>But the results of the Ritual are too various to permit of rigid
description. One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the
Adept need not retain any memory soever of what has occurred. He may be
merely aware of a gap in his conscious life, and judge of its contents
by observing that his nature has been subtly trans- figured. Such an
expérience might indeed be the proof of perfection.</p>
<p>If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel it must be that
some part of his mind is prepared to réalisé the rapture, and to express
it to itself in one way or another. This involves the perfection of that
part, its freedom from préjudice and the limita¬ tions of rationality
so-called. For instance: one could not receive the illumination as to
the nature of life which the doctrine of évolution should shed, if one
is passionately persuaded that humanity is essentially not animal, or
convinced that causality is répugnant to reason. The Adept must be ready
for the utter destruction of his point of view on any subject, and even
that of his innate conception of the forms and laws of thought. 1 Thus
he may find that his Angel consider his “business” or his “love” to be
absurd trifles; also that human ideas of “time” are invalid, and human
“laws” of logic applicable only to the relations bctween illusions.</p>
<p>Now the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any point that is
sensitive to His influence. Such a point will naturally be one that is
salient in the Adept’s character, and also one that is, in the proper
sense of the Word, pure 2 .</p>
<p>Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty is likely to</p>

<li>Of course, even false tenets and modes of the mind are in one sense
true. It is only their appearance which alters. Copernicus did not
destroy the facts of nature, or change the instruments of observation.
He merely effected a radical simplification of science. Error is really
a “fooFs knot”. Moreover, the very tendency responsible for the
entanglement is one of the necessary éléments of the situation. Nothing
is “wrong” in the end; and one cannot reach the “right” point of view
without the aid of one’s particular “wrong” point. If we reject or alter
the négative of a photograph we shall not get a perfect positive.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 . This means, free from ideas, however excellent in themselves,
which are foreign to it. For instance, literary interest has no proper
place in a picture.</p>
<p>— 296 —</p>
<p>receive a visual impression of his Angel in a physical form which is
sublimely quintessential of his idéal. A musician may be rapt away by
majestic mélodies such as he never hoped to hear. A philosopher may
attain appréhension of tremendous truths, the solution of problems that
had baffled him ail his life.</p>
<p>Conformably with this doctrine, we read of illuminations experienced
by simple-minded men, such as a workman who “saw God” and likened Him to
“a quantity of little pears”. Again, we know that ecstasy, impinging
upon unbalanced minds, inflames the idolised idea, and produces
fanatical faith fierce even to frenzy, with intolérance and insanely
disordered energy which is yet so powerful as to effect the destinies of
empires.</p>
<p>But the phenomena of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy
Guardian Angel are a side issue ; the essence of the Union is the
intimacy. Their intimacy (or rather identity) is independent of ail
partial forms of expression ; at its best it is therefore as
inarticulate as Love.</p>
<p>The intensity of the consummation will more probably compel a sob or
a cry, some natural physical gesture of animal sympathy with the
spiritual spasm. This is to be criticised as incomplète self- control.
Silence is nobler.</p>
<p>In any case the Adept must be in communion with his Angel, so that
his Soûl is suffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in
ternis of intellect. It is évident that the stress of such spiritual
possession must tend to overwhelm the soûl, especially at first. It
actually suffers from the excess of its ecstasy, just as extreme love
produces vertigo. The soûl sinks and swoons. Such weakness is fatal
alike to its enjoyment and its appréhension. “Be strong! then canst thou
bear more rapture!” sayeth the Book of the Law. 1</p>
<p>The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing himself to harden his
soûl.</p>
<p>To this end, I, the Beast, hâve made trial and proof of divers
devices. Of these the most potent is to set the body to strive with</p>
<p>I. Liber Al vel Legis, II, 61-68, where the details of the proper
tech¬ nique are discussed.</p>
<p>— 297 —</p>
<p>the seul. Let the muscles take grip on themselves as if one were
wrestling. Let the jaw and mouth, in particular, be tightened to the
utmost. Breathe deeply, slowly, yet strongly. Keep mastery over the mind
by muttering forcibly and audibly. But lest such muttering tend to
disturb communion with the Angel, speak only His Name. Until the Adept
hâve heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perfect
possession of his Beloved. His most important task is thus to open his
ears to the voice of his Angel, that he may know him, how he is called.
For hearken! this Name, understood rightly and fully, declareth the
nature of the Angel in every point, wherefore also that Name is the
formula of the per¬ fection to which the Adept must aspire, and also of
the power of Magick by virtue whereof he must work.</p>
<p>He then that is as yet ignorant of that Name, let him repeat a Word
worthy of this particular Ritual. Such are Abrahadabra, the Word of the
Aeon, which signifieth a The Great Work accom- plished”; and Aumgn
interpreted in Part III of Book 4 1 - y and the name of THE BEAST, for
that His number showeth forth this Union with the Angel, and His Work is
no other than to make ail men partakers of this Mystery of the Mysteries
of Magick.</p>
<p>So then saying this Word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his
Angel and withstand Him, that he may constrain Him to consent to
continue in communion until the consciousness becomes capable of clear
compréhension, and of accurate transmission 2 of the</p>

<li>The essence of this matter is that the Word A U IM, which expresses
the course of Breath (spiritual life) from free utterance through
controlled concentration to Silence, is transmuted by the création of
the compound letter MTN to . replace M: that is, Silence is realised as
passing into continuous ecstatic vibration, of the nature of “Love”

<li>The “normal” intellect is incapable of these functions; a superior
faculty must hâve been developed. As Zoroaster says: “Extend the void
mind of thy soûl to that Intelligible that thou mayst learn the
Intelligible, because it subsisteth beyond Mind. Fhou wilt not
understand It as when understanding some common thing.”</li>

<p>298 —</p>
<p>transcendent Truth of the Beloved to the heart that holds him.</p>
<p>The firm répétition of one of these Words ought to enable the</p>
<p>Adept to maintain the State of Union for several minutes, even at</p>
<p>first.</p>
<p>In any case he must rekindle his ardour, esteeming his success rather
as an encouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph. He
should increase his efforts.</p>
<p>Let him beware of the “lust of resuit”, of expecting too much, of
losing courage if his first success is followed by a sériés of
failures.</p>
<p>For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to
create an inhibition fatal to subséquent attempts. One fears to failj
the fear intrudes upon the concentration and so fulfils its own
prophecy. We know how too much pleasure in a love affair makes one
afraid to disgrâce oneself on the next few occasions; indeed, until
familiarity has accustomed one to the idea that one’s lover has never
supposed one to be more than human. Confidence returns gradually.
Inarticulate ecstasy is replaced by a more sober enjoy- ment of the
éléments of the fascination.</p>
<p>Just so one’s first dazzled delight in a new landscape turns, as one
continues to gaze, to the appréciation of exquisite details of the view.
At first they were blurred by the blinding rush of general beauty ; they
emerge one by one as the shock subsides, and passionate rapture yields
to intelligent interest.</p>
<p>In the same way the Adept almost always begins by torrential lyrics
panting out mystical extravagances about “ineffable love”, “unimaginable
bliss”, “inexpressible infinities of illimitabie utter- ness”. 1 He
usually loses his sense of proportion, of humour, of reality, and of
Sound judgment. His ego is often inflated to bursting point, till he
would be abjectly ridiculous if he were not so pitifully dangerous to
himself and others. He also tends to take his new-found “truths of
illumination” for the entire body of truth, and insists that they must
be as valid and vital for ail men as they happen to be for himself.</p>
<p>I. This corresponds to the emotional and metaphysical fog which is
characteristic of the emergence of thought from homogeneity. The clear
and concise différentiation of ideas marks the adult mind.</p>
<p>— 2 99</p>
<p>It is wise to keep silence about those things “unlawful to utter”
which one may hâve heard “in the seventh heaven”. This may not apply to
the sixth.</p>
<p>The Adept must keep himself in hand, however tempted to make a new
heaven and a new earth in the next few davs by trumpeting his triumphs.
He must give time a chance to redress his balance, sore shaken by the
impact of the Infinité.</p>
<p>As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find
his passionate ecstasy develop a quality of peace and intelligi- bility
which adds power, while it informs and fortifies his mental and moral
qualifies instead of obscuring and upsetting them. He will by now hâve
become able to converse with his Angel, impossible as it once seemedj
for he now knows that the storm of Sound which he supposed to be the
Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions. The “infinity”
nonsense was born of his own inability to think clearly beyond his
limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five, can only
call them “many”.</p>
<p>The truth told by the Angel, immensely as it extends the horizon of
the Adept, is perfectly definite and précisé. It does not deal in
ambiguities and abstractions. It possesses form, and con¬ fesses law, in
exactly the same way and degree as any other body of truth. It is to the
truth of the material and intellectual spheres of man very much what the
Mathematics of Philosophy with its “infinité sériés” and “Cantorian
continuity” is to schoolboy arith- metic. Each implies the other, though
by that one may explore the essential nature of existence, and by this a
pawnbroker’s profits.</p>
<p>This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole operation, to
assimilate himself to his Angel by continuai conscious com¬ munion. For
his Angel is an intelligible image of his own true Will, to do which is
the whole of the law of his Being.</p>
<p>Also the Angel appeareth in Tiphereth, which is the heart of the
Ruach, and thus the Centre of Gravity of the Mind. It is also directly
inspired from Kether, the ultimate Self, through the Path of the High
Priestess, or initiated intuition. ITence the Angel is in truth the
Logos or articulate expression of the whole Being of the Adept, so that
as he increases in the perfect understanding of</p>
<p>— 3 00 ~</p>
<p>His name, he approaches the solution of the ultimate problem, Who he
himself truly is.</p>
<p>Unto this final statement the Adept may trust his Angel to lead him;
for the Tiphereth-consciousness alone is connected by paths with the
various parts of his mind. 1 None therefore save He hath the knowledge
requisite for calculating the combinations of conduct which will
organise and equilibrate the forces of the Adept, against the moment
when it becomes necessary to confront the Abyss. The Adept must control
a compact and cohérent mass if he is to make sure of hurling it from him
with a clean-cut gesture.</p>
<p>I, The Beast 666, lift up my voice and swear that I myself hâve been
brought hither by mine Angel. After that I had attained unto the
Knowledge and Conversation of Him by virtue of mine ardour towards Him,
and of this Ritual that I bestow upon men my fellows, and most of His
great Love that He beareth to me, yea, verily, He led me to the Abyss ;
He bade me fling away ail that I had and ail that I was; and He forsook
me in that Hour. But when I came beyond the Abyss, to be reborn within
the womb of BABALON, then came he unto me abiding in my virgin heart,
its Lord and Lover!</p>
<p>Also He made me a Magus, speaking through His Law, the Word of the
new Aeon, the Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child. 2 Thus he
fulfilled my will to bring full freedom to the race of Men.</p>
<p>Yea, he wrought also in me a Work of Wonder beyond this, but in this
matter I am sworn to hold my peace.</p>

<p>The Magician, his breast bare, stands before an altar on which are
his Burin, Bell, Thurible, and two of the Cakes of Light. In the Sign of
the Enterer he reaches West across the Altar, and cries:</p>
<p>Hail Ra, that goest in thy bark Into the caverns of the Dark!</p>
<p>He gives the sign of Silence, and takes the Bell, and F ire, in this

<p>The FINAL GESTURE.</p>
<p>This is identical with the First Gesture.</p>
<p>(Here followeth an impression of the ideas implied in this
Paean.)</p>
<p>— 334 —</p>
<p>I also am a Star in Space, unique and self-existent, an individual
essence incorruptible; I also am 011e Soûl; I am identical with Ail and
None. I am in Ail and ail in Me; I am, apart from ail and lord of ail,
and one with ail.</p>
<p>I am a God, î very God of very God; I go upon my way to work my will;
I hâve made matter and motion for my mirror; I hâve decreed for my
delight that Nothingness should figure itself as twain, that I might
dream a dance of names and natures, and enjoy the substance of
simplicity by watching the wanderings of my shadows. I am not that which
is not; I know not that which knows not; I love not that which loves
not. For I am Love, whereby division dies in delight; I am Knowledge,
whereby ail parts, plunged in the whole, perish and pass into
perfection; and I am that I am, the being wherein Being is lost in
Nothing, nor deigns to be but by its Will to unfold its nature, its need
to express its perfection in ail possibilités, each phase a partial
phantasm, and yet inévitable and absolute.</p>
<p>I am Omniscient, for naught exists for me unless I know it. I am
Omnipotent, for naught occurs save by Necessity my soûl s expression
through my will to be, to do, to suffer the symbols of itself. I am
Omniprésent, for naught exists where I am not, who fashioned space as a
condition of my consciousness of myself, who am the centre of ail, and
my circumference the frame of mine own fancy.</p>
<p>I am the Ail, for ail that exists for me is a necessary expression in
thought of some tendency of my nature, and ail my thoughts are only the
letters of my Name.</p>
<p>I am the One, for ail that I am is not the absolute Ail, and ail my
ail is mine and not another’s; mine, who conceive of others like myself
in essence and truth, yet unlike in expression and illusion.</p>
<p>I am the None, for ail that I am is the imperfect image of the
perfect; each partial phantom must perish in the clasp of its coun-
terpart; each form fulfil itself by finding its equated opposite, and
satisfying its need to be the Absolute by the attainment of annihila¬
tion.</p>
<p>The word, LAShTAL includes ail this.</p>
<p>LA — Naught.</p>
<p>~ 335 ~</p>
<p>AL — Two.</p>
<p>L is “Justice”, the Kteis fulfilled by the Phallus, “Naught and Two”
because the plus and the minus hâve United in “love under will.”</p>
<p>A is “the Fool”, Naught in Thought (Parzival), Word (Harpo- crates),
and Action (Bacchus). He is the boundless air, the wander- ing Ghost,
but with “possibilités”. He is the Naught that the Two hâve made by
“love under will”.</p>
<p>LA thus represents the Ecstasy of Nuit and Hadit conjoined, lost in
love, and making themselves Naught thereby. Their child is begotten and
conceived, but is in the phase of Naught also, as yet. LA is thus the
Universe in that phase, with its potentialities of manifestation.</p>
<p>AL, on the contrary, though it is essentially identical with LA,
shows the Fool manifested through the Equilibrium of Contraries. The
weight is still nothing, but it is expressed as if it were two equal
weights in opposite scales. The indicator still points to zéro.</p>
<p>ShT is equally 31 with LA and AL, but it expresses the secret nature
which opérâtes the Magick or the transmutations.</p>
<p>ShT is the formula of this particular aeon; another aeon might hâve
another way of saying 31.</p>
<p>S h is Fire as T is Force; conjoined they express Ra-Hoor-Khuit.</p>
<p>“The Angel” represents the Stélé 666, showing the Gods of the Aeon,
while “Strength” is a picture of Babalon and The Beast, the earthly
emissaries of those Gods.</p>
<p>ShT is the dynamic équivalent of LA and AL. S h shows the Word of the
Law, being triple, as 93 is thrice 31. T shows the formula of Magick
declared in that Word; the Lion, the Serpent, the Sun, Courage and
Sexual Love are ail indicated by the card.</p>
<p>In LA note that Saturn or Satan is exalted in the House of Venus or
Astarte, and it is an airy sign. Thus L is Father-Mother, Two and
Naught, and the Spirit (Holy Ghost) of their Love is also Naught. Love
is AHBH, 13, which is AChD, Unity, I, Aleph, who is The Fool who is
Naught, but none the less an Individual One, who (as such) is not
another, yet unconscious of himself until his Oneness expresses itself
as a duality.</p>
<p>Any impression or idea is unknowable in itself. It can mean</p>
<p>— 336 ~</p>
<p>nothing until brought into relation with other things. The first step
is to distinguish one thought from another; this is the condi¬ tion of
recognizing it. To define it, we must perceive its orientation to ali
our other ideas. The extent of our knowledge of any one thing varies
therefore with the number of ideas with which we can compare it. Every
new fact not only adds itself to our universe, but increases the value
of what we already possess.</p>
<p>In AL this “The” or “God” arranges for “Countenance to behold
countenance”, by establishing itself as an equilibrium, A the One-
Naught conceived as L the Two-Naught. This L is the Son- Daughter
Horus-Harpocrates just as the other L was the Father- Mother Set-Isis.
Here then is Tetragrammaton once more, but expressed in identical
équations in which every term is perfect in itself as a mode of
Naught.</p>
<p>ShT supplies the last element; making the Word of either five or six
letters, according as we regard ShT as one letter or two. Thus the Word
affirms the Great Work accomplished : 5° = 6 D -</p>
<p>ShT is moreover a necessary resolution of the apparent opposi¬ tion
of LA and AL, for one could hardly pass to the other without the
catalytic action of a third identical expression whose function should
be to transmute them. Such a term must be in itself a mode of Naught,
and its nature cannot encroach on the perfections of Not-Being, LA, or
of Being, AL. It must be purely Nothing- Matter, so as to create a
Matter-in-Motion which is a function of “Something”.</p>
<p>Thus ShT is Motion in its double phase, an inertia composed of two
opposite currents, and each current is also thus polarized. Sh is Heaven
and Earth, T Male and Female j ShT is Spirit and Matter- one is the Word
of Liberty and Love flashing its Light to restore Life to Earth j the
other is the act by which Life daims that Love is Light and Liberty. And
these are Two-in-One, the divine letter of Silence-in-Speech whose
Symbol is the Sun in the arms of the Moon.</p>
<p>But Sh and T are alike formulae of force in action as opposed to
entities; they are not States of existence, but modes of motion. They
are verbs, not nouns.</p>
<p>Sh is the Holy Spirit as a “tongue of fire” manifest in
triplicity,</p>
<p>— 337 —</p>
<p>and is the child of Set-Isis as their Logos or Word uttered by their
“Angel”. The card is XX, and 20 is the value of Yod (the Angel or
Herald) expressed in full as IVD. S h is the Spiritual congress of
Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>But T is the Holy Spirit in action as a “roaring lion” or as the u
old Serpent” instead of as an “Angel of Light”. The twins of Set-Isis,
harlot and beast, are busy with that sodomitic and incestuous lust which
is the traditional formula for producing demi-gods, as m the cases of
Mary and the Dove; Leda and the Swan, etc. The card is XI, the number of
Magick AVD : Aleph the Fool impregnating the woman according to the Word
of Yod, the Angel of the Lord ! His sister has seduced her brother
Beast, shaming the Sun with her sin; she has mastered the Lion and
enchanted the Serpent. Nature is outraged by Magick ; man is bestialized
and woman defiled. The conj miction produces a monster; it, affirms
régression of types. Instead of a man-God conceived of the Spirit of God
by a virgin in innocence, we are asked to adore the bastard of a whore
and a brute, begotten in shamefullest sin and born in most blasphemous
bliss.</p>
<p>This is in fact the formula of our Magick ; we insist that ail acts
must be equal; that existence asserts the right to exist ; that uniess
evil is a mere term expressing some relation of haphazard hostility
between forces equally self-justihed, the universe is as inexplicable
and impossible as uncompensated action 5 that the orgies of Bacchus and
Pan are no less sacramental than the Masses of Jésus 3 that the scars of
syphilis are sacrecl and worthy of honour as such.</p>
<p>It should be unnecessary to insist that the above ideas apply only to
the Absolute. Toothache is still painful, and deceit degrading, to a
man, relatively to his situation in the world of illusion ; he does his
Will by avoiding them. But the existence of a Evil” is fatal to
philosophy so long as it is supposed to be independent of conditions ;
and to accustom the mind “to make no différence” between any two ideas
as such is to emancipate it from the thralldom of terror.</p>
<p>We affirm on our altars our faith in ourselves and our wills, our
love of ail aspects of the Absolute Ail.</p>
<p>— 338</p>
<p>And we make the Spirit Shin combine with the Flesh Teth into a single
letter, whose value is 31 even as those of LA the Naught, and AL the
Ail, to complété their Not-Being and Being with its Becoming, to médiate
between identical extremes as their mean — the secret that sunders and
seals them.</p>
<p>It déclarés that ail somethings are equally shadows of Mothing, and
justifies Nothing in its futile folly of pretending that something is
stable, by making us aware of a method of Magick through the practice of
which we may partake in the pleasure of the process.</p>
<p>The Magician should devise for himself a definite technique for
destroving “evil”. The essence of such a practice will consist in
training the mind and the body to confront things which cause fear,
pain, disgust 1 , shame, and the like. He must learn to endure them,
then to become indifferent to them, then to analyse them until they give
pleasure and instruction, and finally to appreciate them for their own
sake, as aspects of Truth. When this has been done, he should abandon
them if they are really harmful in relation to health or comfort. Also,
our sélection of “evils” is limited to those that cannot damage us
irreparably. E.g., 011e ought to practise smelling assafoetida until one
likes it ; but not arsine or hydrocyanic acid. Again, one might hâve a
liaison with an ugly old woman until one beheld and loved the star which
she is; it would be too dangerous to overcome the distaste for
dishonesty by forcing oneself to pick pockets. Acts which are
essentially dishonourable must not be done; they should be justified
only by calm contemplation of their correctness in abstract cases.</p>
<p>Love is a virtue; it grows stronger and purer and less seifish by
applying it to what it loathes; but theft is a vice involving the
slave-idea that one’s neighbour is superior to oneself. It is admirable
only for its power to develop certain moral and mental qualities in
primitive types, to prevent the atrophy of such facultés as our own
vigilance, and for the interest which it adds to the “tragedy, Man.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The People of England hâve made two révolutions to free them- selves
from Popish fraud and tyranny. They are at their tricks again; and if we
hâve to make a Third Révolution, let us destroy the germ itself !</li>
</ol>
<p>— 339</p>
<p>Crime, folly, sickness and ail such phenomena must be contem- plated
with complété freedom from fear, aversion, or shame. Otherwise we shall
fail to see accurately, and interpret intelli- gentlyj in which case we
shall be unable to outwit and outfight them. Anatomists and
physiologists, grappling in the dark with death, hâve won hygiene,
surgery, prophylaxis and the rest for mankind. Anthropologists,
archaeologists, physicists and other men of science, risking thumbscrew,
stake, infamy and ostracism, hâve torn the spider-snare of superstition
to shreds and broken in pièces the monstrous idol of Morality, the
murderous Moloch which has made mankind its méat throughout history.
Each fragment of that coprolite is manifest as an image of some brute
lust, some torpid dullness, some ignorant instinct, or some furtive fear
shapen in his own savage mind.</p>
<p>Man is indeed not wholly freed, even now. He is still trampled under
the hoofs of the stampeding mules that nightmare bore to his wild ass,
his Creative forces that he had not mastered, the stérile ghosts that he
called gods. Their mystery cows men still j they fear, they flinch, they
dare not face the phantoms. Still, too, the fallen fetich seems awfulj
it is frightful to them that there is no longer an idol to adore with
anthems, and to appease with the flesh of their firstborn. Each
scrambles in the bloody mire of the floor to snatch some scrap for a
relie, that he may bow down to it and serve it.</p>
<p>So, even to-day, a mass of maggots swarm heaving over the carrion
earth, a brotherhood bound by blind greed for rottenness. Science still
hésitâtes to raze the temple of Rimmon, though every year finds more of
her sons impatient of Naaman’s prudence. The Privy Council of the
Kingdom of Mansoul sits in permanent secret session j it dares not
déclaré what must follow its deed in shattering the monarch morality
into scraps of crumbling conglomerate of climatic, tribal, and personal
préjudices, corrupted yet more by the action of crafty ambition, insane
impulse, ignorant arrogance, superstitious hysteria, fear fashioning
falsehoods on the stone that it sets on the grave of Truth whom it has
murdered and buried in the black earth Oblivion. Moral philosophy,

<p>the children of wisdom, of whom she is justified, well know that the
laws of Ethics are a chaos of confused conventions, based at best on
customs convenient in certain conditions, more often on the craft or
caprice of the biggest, the most savage, heartless, cunning and
blood-thirsty brutes of the pack, to secure their power or pander to
their pleasure in cruelty. There is no principle, even a false one, to
give cohérence to the clamour of ethical propositions. Yet the very men
that hâve smashed Moloch, and strewn the earth with shapeless rubble,
grow pale when they so much as whisper among themelves, “While Moloch
ruled ail men were bound by the one law, and by the oracles of them
that, knowing the fraud, feared not, but were his priests and wardens of
his mystery. What now ? How can any of us, though wise and strong as
never was known, prevail on men to act in concert, now that each prays
to his own chip of God, and yet knows every other chip to be a worthless
ort, dream-dust, ape-dung, tradition-bone, or — what not else ?”</p>
<p>So science begins to see that the Initiâtes were maybe not merely
silly and selfish in making their rule of silence, and in protecting
philosophy from the profane. Yet still she hopes that the mischief may
not prove mortal, and begs that things may go on much as usual until
that secret session décidé on some plan of action.</p>
<p>It has always been fatal when somebody finds out too much too
suddenly. If John Huss had cackled more like a hen, he might hâve
survived Michaelmas, and been esteemed for his eggs. The last fifty
years hâve laid the axe of analysis to the root of every axiomj they are
triflers who content themselves with lopping the blossoming twigs of our
beliefs, or the boughs of our intellectual instruments. We can no longer
assert any single proposition, unless we guard ourselves by enumerating
countless conditions</p>
<p>which must be assumed.</p>
<p>This digression has outstayed its welcomej it was only invited by
Wisdom that it might warn Rashness of the dangers that encompass even
Sincerity, Energy and Intelligence when they happen not to contribute to
Fitness-in-their-environment.</p>
<p>The Magician must be wary in his use of his powers; he must make
every act not only accord with his Will, but with the pro¬ priétés of
his position at the time. It might be my will to reach</p>
<p>— 34i</p>
<p>the foot of a cliff; but the easiest way — also the speediest, most
direct, least obstructed, the way of minimum effort—would be simply to
jump. I should hâve destroyed my will in the act of fulfilling it, or
what I mistook for it; for the true will has no goal ; its nature being
to Go. Similarly a paraboia is bound by one law which fixes its
relations with two straight lines at every point ; yet it has no end
short of infinity, and it continually changes its direc¬ tion. The
initiate who is aware Who he is can always check his conduct by
reference to the déterminants of his curve, and calculate his past, his
future, his bearings and his proper course at any assigned moment 5 he
can even comprehend himself as a simple idea. He may attain to measure
fellow-parabolas, ellipses that cross his path, hyperbolas that span ail
space with their twin wings. Perhaps he may corne at long last, leaping
beyond the limits of his own law, to conceive that sublimely stupendous
outrage to Reason, the Cône! Utterly inscrutable to him, he is yet well
aware that he exists in the nature thereof, that he is necessary
thereto, that he is ordered thereby, and that therefrom he is sprung,
frcm the loins of so fearful a Father! His own infinity becomes zéro in
relation to that of the least fragment of the solid. He hardly exists at
ail. Trillions multiplied by trillions of trillions of such as he coula
not cross the frontier even of breadth, the idea which he came to guess
at only because he felt himself bound by some mysterious power. Yet
breadth is equally a nothing in the presence of the Cône. His first
conception must evidently be a frantic spasm, formless, insane, not to
be classed as articulate thought. Yet, if he develops the faculties of
his mind, the more he knows of it the more he sees that its nature is
identical with his own whenever comparison is possible.</p>
<p>The True Will is thus both determined by its équations, and free
because those équations are simply its own name, spelt out fully. His
sense of being under bondage cornes from his inability to read it; his
sense that evil exists to thwart him arises when he begms to learn to
read, reads wrong, and is obstinate that his error is an
improvement.</p>
<p>We know one thing only. Absolute existence, absolute motion, absolute
direction, absolute simultaneity, absolute truth, ail such</p>
<p>— 342 —</p>
<p>ideasj they hâve not, and never can hâve, any real meaning. If a man
in delirium tremens fell into the Hudson River, he might remember the
proverb and clutch at an imaginary straw. Words such as “truth” are like
that straw. Confusion of thought is concealed, and its impotence denied,
by the invention. This paragraph opened with, “We know”: yet,
questioned, a we” make haste to deny the possibility of possessing, or
even of defining, knowledge. What could be more certain to a
parabola-philosopher than that he could be approached in two ways, and
two only? It would be indeed little less than the whole body of his
knowledge, implied in the theory of his définition of himself, and
confirmed by every single expérience. Fie could receive impressions only
by meeting A, or being caught up by B.  et he would be wrong in an
infinité number of ways. There are therefore Aleph-Zero possibilities
that at any moment a man may find himself totally transformed. And it
may be that our présent dazzled bewilderment is due to our récogni¬ tion
of the existence of a new dimension of thought, which seems so
“inscrutably infinité” and “absurd” and “immoral”, etc. — because we
hâve not studied it long enough to appreciate that its laws are
identical with our own, though extended to new conceptions. The
discovery of radioactivi’ty created a momentary chaos in chemistry and
physics; but it soon led to a fuller interprétation of the old ideas. It
dispersed many difficultés, harmonized many discords, and — yea, more!
It shewed the substance of the Universe as a simplicity of Light and
Life, possessed of limitless liberty to enjoy Love by combining its
units in various manners to compose atoms, themselves capable of deeper
self-realization through fresh complexities and organizations, each with
its own peculiar powers and pleasures, each pursuing its path through
the world where ail things are possible. It revealed the omniprésence of
Hadit identical with Himself, yet fulfilling Himself by dividing his
interplay with Nuit into épisodes, each form of his energy isolated with
each aspect of Her receptivity, delight developing delight continuous
from complex to complex. It was the voice of Nature awakening at the
dawn of the Aeon, as Aiwaz uttered the Word of the Law of Thelema.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p>So also shall he who invoketh often behold the Formless Fire, with
trembling and bewilderment ; but if he prolong his méditation, he shall
résolve it into cohérent and intelligible symbols, and he shall hear the
articulate utterance of that Fire, interpret the thunder thereof as a
still small voice in his heart. And the Fire shall reveal to his eyes
his own image in its own true glorv; and it shall speak in his ears the
Mystery that is his own right Name.</p>
<p>This then is the virtue of the Magick of The Beast 666, and the canon
of its proper usage: to destroy the tendency to discriminate between any
two things in theory, and in practice to pierce the veils of every
sanctuary, pressing forward to embrace every image ; for there is none
that is not very Isis. The Inmost is one with the Inmostj yet the form
of the One is not the form of the otherj intimacy exacts fitness. He
therefore who liveth by air, let him not be bold to breathe water. But
mastery cometh by measure: to him who with labour, courage, and caution
giveth his life to under- stand ail that doth encompass him, and to
prevail against it, shall be increase. “The Word of Sin is Restriction”
; seek therefore Righteousness, enquiring into Iniquity, and fortify
thyself to overcome it.</p>

<p>In the East, that is, in the direction of Boleskine, which is
situated on the south-eastern shore of Loch Ness in Scotland, two miles
east of Foyers, is a shrine or High Altar. Its dimensions should be 7
feet in length, 3 feet in breadth, 44 inches in height. It should be
covered with a crimson altar-cloth, on which may be embroidered
fleur-de-lys in gold, or a sunblaze, or other suitable emblem.</p>
<p>On each side of it should be a pillar or obelisk, with counter-
charges in black and white.</p>
<p>Below it should be the dais of three steps, in black and white
squares.</p>
<p>Above it is the super-altar, at whose top is the Stélé of Revealing
in reproduction, with four candies on each side of it. Below the stélé
is a place for the Book of the Law, with six candies on each side of it.
Below this again is the Holy Graal, with roses on each side of it. There
is room in front of the Cup for the Paten. On each side beyond the roses
are two great candies.</p>
<p>Ail this is enclosed within a great veil.</p>
<p>Forming the apex of an équilatéral triangle whose base is a line
drawn between the pillars, is a small black square altar, of two
super-imposed cubes.</p>
<p>Taking this altar as the middle of the base of a similar and equal
triangle, at the apex of this second triangle is a small circular
font.</p>
<p>Repeating, the apex of a third triangle is an upright tomb.</p>

<p>The PRIEST, issuing jrom the Tomb y holding the Tance erect with both
hands y right over lejt y against his breast y takes the first three

three penal signs.</p>
<p>He then kneels and vsorships the Tance with both hands .</p>

<p>The PRIEST. I am a man among men.</p>
<p>He takes again the Tance and lowers it. He rises.</p>
<p>The PRIEST. How should I be worthy to administer the virtues to the
Brethren?</p>
<p>The PRIESTESS takes jrom the chïld the water and the salt y and mixes
them in the font.</p>
<p>The PRIESTESS. Let the sait of Earth admonish the Water to bear the

<p>The DEACON brings the crown jrom the High Altar. (The</p>

<p>I, PRIEST and KING, take thee, Virgin pure without spot; I upraise
thee; I iead thee to the East; I set thee upon the summit of the

<p>He thrones the PRIESTESS upon the altar. The DEACON and the children
follow y they in rank y behind him. The PRIESTESS takes the Book of the
Raw y résumés her seat y and holds it open on her breast with her two
hands y making a descending triangle with thumbs and forefingers.</p>
<p>The PRIEST gives the lance to the DEACON to hold; and takes the ever
from the child y and sprinkles the PRIESTESS, making five crosses y
forehead y shoulders y and thighs.</p>
<p>The thumb of the PRIEST is always between his index and</p>

censer from the childy and makes five crosses as bejore.</p>
<p>The chïldren replace their weapons on their respective altars.</p>
<p>The PRIEST hisses the hook of the JLaw three ti/mes. He kneels for a
space in adoration y with joined hands y knuckles closed y thumb in
position as aforesaid. He rises and draws the veil over the whole
alta-r. Ail rise and stand to order.</p>
<p>The PRIEST takes the lance from the DEACON and holds it as beforey as
Osiris or Ththah. He circumambulates the Temple three timeSy f ollowed
by the DEACON and the children as before. ( These y when not using their
handsy keep their arms crossed upon their breasts .) At the last
circumambulation they leave him and go to the place between the font and
the small altar y where they kneel in adoration y their hands joined
palm to palm y and raised above their heads.</p>
<p>Ail imitate this motion.</p>
<p>The PRIEST returns to the East and mounts the first step of the
Altar.</p>
<p>The PRIEST. O circle of Stars whereof our Father is but the younger
brother, marvel beyond imagination, soûl of infinité space, before whom
Time is ashamed, the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not
unto Thee may we attain, unless Thine image be Love. Therefore by seed
and root and stem and bud and leaf and flower and fruit we do invoke
Thee.</p>
<p>Then the priest answered and said unto the Queen of Space, kissing
her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a
sweet-smelling perfume of sweat; O Nuit, con- tinuous one of Heaven, let
it be ever thus, that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let
them speak not of thee at ail, since thou art continuous.</p>
<p>Euring this speech the PRIESTESS must hâve divesied her self
completely of her robe y See CCXX.1.61.</p>
<p>The PRIESTESS. But to love me is better than ail things: if under the
night-stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me,
invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt
corne a little to lie in my bosom. For one</p>
<p>kiss wilt thou then be willing to give ail 5 but whoso gives one
particle of dust shall lose ail in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and
store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed
the nations of the earth in splendour and pride; but always in the love
of me, and so shall ye corne to my joy. I charge you earnestly to corne
before me in a single robe, and covered with a rich headdress. I love
you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am ail
pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you.
Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: corne unto

<p>I love you! I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset. I am the naked
brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky. To me! To me!</p>
<p>The PRIEST mounts the second ste’p. </p>
<p>The PRIEST. O secret of secrets that art hidden in the being of ail
that lives, not Thee do we adore, for that which adoreth is also Thou.
Thou art That, and That am I.</p>
<p>I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of
every star. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the
knowledge of me the knowledge of death. I am alone; there is no God

<li>It is absolutely necessary that ail experiments should be recorded
in detail during, or immediately after, their performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>1 . It is highly important to note the physical and mental condi¬
tion of the expérimenter or experimenters.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>The time and place of ail experiments must be noted; also the
State of the weather, and generally ail conditions which might
conceivably hâve any resuit upon the experiment either as adju¬ vants to
or causes of the resuit, or as inhibiting it, or as sources of
error.</p></li>
<li><p>The A.-. A.*, will not take official notice of any experi¬ ments
which are not thus properly recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not necessary at this stage for us to déclaré fully the
ultimate end of our researchesj nor indeed would it be understood by
those who hâve not become proficient in these elementary
courses.</p></li>
<li><p>The expérimenter is encouraged to use his own intelligence, and
not to rely upon any other person or persons, however distin- guished,
even among ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The written record should be intelligently prepared so that
others may benefit from its study.</p></li>
<li><p>The Book John St John published in the first number of the
“Equinox” is an example of this kind of record by a very advanced
student. It is not as simply written as we could wish, but will show the
method.</p></li>
<li><p>The more scientific the record is, the better. Yet the émo¬ tions
should be noted, as being some of the conditions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let then the record be written with sincerity and carej thus with
practice it will be found more and more to approximate to thé idéal.</p>

<p>Physical clairvoyance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Take a pack of (78) Tarot playing cards. Shufïle; eut. Draw one
card. Without looking at it, try to name it. Write down the card you
name, and the actual card. Repeat, and tabulate results.</p></li>
<li><p>This experiment is probably easier with an old genuine pack of
Tarot cards, preferably a pack used for divination by some one who
really understood the matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that one should expect to name the right card once in 78
times. Also be careful to exciude ail possibilities of obtaining the
knowledge through the ordinary senses of sight and touch, or even
smell.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There was once a man whose fingertips were so sensitive that he could
feel the shape and position of the pips and so judge the card
correctly.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>It is better to try first the easier form of the experiment, by
guessing only the suit.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that in 78 experiments you should obtain 22 trumps and
14 of each other suit 5 so that without any clairvoyance at ail, you can
guess right twice in 7 times (roughly) by calling trumps each
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that some cards are harmonious.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus it would not be a bad error to call the five of Swords (“The
Lord of Defeat”) instead of the ten of Swords (“The Lord of Ruin”). But
to call the Lord of Love (2 Cups) for the Lord of Strife (5 Wands) would
show that you were getting nothing right.</p>
<p>Similarly a card ruled by Mars would be harmonious with a 5, a card
of Gemini with “The Lovers”.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>These harmonies must be thoroughly learnt, according to the
numerous tables given in 777.</p></li>
<li><p>As you progress you will find that you are able to distinguish
the suit correctly three times in four and that very few indeed inhar-
monious errors occur, while in 78 experiments you are able to name the
card aright as many as 15 or 20 times.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hâve reached this stage, you may be admitted
for</p></li>

<li><p>Various things will happen to you while you are practising these
positions j they must be carefully analysed and described.</p></li>
<li><p>Note down the duration of practice j the severity of the pain (if
any) which accompanies it, the degree of rigidity attained, and any
other pertinent matters.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hâve progressed up to the point that a saucer filled to
the brim with water and poised upon the head does not spill one drop
during a whole hour, and when you can no longer perceive the slightest
tremor in any muscle j when, in short, you are perfectly steady and
easy, you will be admitted for examination 3 and, should you pass, you
will be instructed in more complex and difficult practices.</p></li>

<p>Pranayama — Régularisation of the Breathing</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At rest in one of your positions, close the right nostril with the
thumb of the right hand and breathe out slowly and completely</li>
</ol>
<p>through the left nostril, while your watch marks 20 seconds. Breathe
in through the same nostril for 10 seconds. Changing hands, repeat with
the other nostril. Let this be continuons for one hour.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>When this is quite easy to you, increase the periods to 30 and 15
seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>When this is quite easy to you, but not before, breathe out for
15 seconds, in for 15 seconds, and hold the breath for 15
seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>When you can do this with perfect ease and comfort for a whole
hour, practice breathing out for 40 and in for 20 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>This being attained, practice breathing out for 20, in for 10,
holding the breath for 30 seconds.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When this has become perfectly easy to you, you may be admit- ted for
examination, and should you pass, you will be instructed in more complex
and difficult practices.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>You will find that the presence of food in the stomach, even in
small quantifies, makes the practices very difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>Be very careful never to overstrain your powers; especially never
get so short of breath that you are compelled to breathe out jerkily or
rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>Strive after depth, fullness, and regularity of
breathing.</p></li>

these practices. They must be carefully analysed and recorded.</p></li>

<p>Dharana — Contre! of Thought.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Constrain the mind to concentrate itself upon a single simple object
imagined.</li>

<p>The five tatwas are useful for this purpose; they are : a black ovalj
a blue disk j a silver crescent ; a yellow square ; a red triangle.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Proceed to combinations of simple objects ; e.g. a black oval
within a yellow square, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to simple moving objects, such as a pendulum swinging, a
whee.1 revolving, etc. Avoid living objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to combinations of moving objects, e.g. a piston</p></li>
</ol>

<p>rising and falling while a pendulum is swinging. The relation between
the two movements should be varied in different experi- ments.</p>
<p>Or even a System of flywheels, eccentrics, and governor.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>During these practices the mind must be absolutely confined to
the object determined upon; no other thought must be allowed to intrude
upon the consciousness. The moving Systems must be regular and
harmonious.</p></li>
<li><p>Note carefully the duration of the experiments, the number and
nature of the intruding thoughts, the tendency of the object itself to
départ from the course laid out for it, and any other pheno- mena which
may présent themselves. Avoid overstrain ; this is very
important.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to imagine living objects; as a man, preferably sorne man
known to, and respected by, yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>In the intervals of these experiments you may try to imagine the
objects of the other senses, and to concentrate upon them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, try to imagine the taste of chocolaté, the smell of
roses, the feeling of velvet, the Sound of a waterfall or the ticking of
a watch.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Endeavour finally to shut out ail objects of any of the sen¬ sés,
and prevent ail thoughts arising in your mind. When you feel you hâve
attained some success in these practices, apply for examination, and

<li></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use
the most minute critical care in the study of it, even as we hâve done
in the préparation.</p></li>
<li><p>In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, of
Spirits and Conjurations ; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other
things which may or may not exist.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is immaterial whether they exist or not. By doing certain things
certain results follow; students are most earnestly warned against
attributing objective reality or philosophie validity to any of
them.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A widening of the horizon of the mind.</p></li>
<li><p>An improvement of the control of the mind.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The student, if he attains any success in the following practices,
will find himself confrontcd by things (ideas or beings) too glorious or
too dreadful to be described. It is essential that he remain the master
of ail that he beholds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the
slave of illusion and the prey of madness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before entering upon any of these practices the student must be in
good health, and hâve attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama and
Dharana.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid.
will fail to get some resuit ; but there is great danger that he will be
led astray, even though it be by those which it is necessary that he
should attain. Too often, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place
for the goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the
fight is well begun.</li>
</ol>
<p>— 375 —</p>
<p>It k désirable that the student shouid never attach to any resuit the
importance which it at first seems to possess.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>First, then, let us consider the Book 777 and its use; the
préparation of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and finally
the methods which follow in Chapter V. “Viator in Regnis Arboris” and in
Chapter VI “Sagitta trans Lunam.”</li>
</ol>
<p>(In another book will be treated of the Expansion and Contrac¬ tion
of Consciousness ; progress by slaying the Cakkrâms; progress by slaying
the Pairs of Opposites; the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, etc., etc.)</p>
<p>IL</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The student must first obtain a thorough knowledge of Book 777,
especially of the columns printed elsewhere in this Book.</li>
</ol>
<p>When these are committed to memory, he will begin to under- stand the
nature of these correspondences. (See Illustrations in “The Temple of
Solomon the King” in Equinox No. 2. Cross references are given.)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>If we take an example, the use of the tables will become clear.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some obscure
science.</p>
<p>In column xlv 1 , line 12, you will find “Knowledge of Sciences.”</p>
<p>By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find that
the Planet corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its lineal
figures the octagon and octagram. The God who rules that planet Thoth,
or in Hebrew symbolism Tetragrammaton Adonai and Elohim Tzabaoth, its
Archangel Raphaël, its choir of Angels Béni Elohim, its Intelligence
Tiriel, its Spirit Taphtatharath, its colours Orange (for Mercury is the
Sphere of the Sephira Hod, 8) Yellow, Purple, Grey and Indigo rayed with
Violet; its Magical Weapon the Wand or Caduceus, its Per fumes Mastic
and others, its sacred plants Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal or
Agate; its sacred animal the Snake, etc., etc.</p>
<p>I. Référencé to the First Edition.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>You would then préparé your Place of Working accordingly. In an
orange circle you would draw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose
points you would place eight lamps. The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to
be found in Cornélius Agrippa and other books) you would draw in the
four colours with such other devices as your expérience may
suggest.</p></li>
<li><p>And so on. We cannot here enter at length into ail the necessary
préparations ; and the student will find them fully set forth in the
proper books, of which the “Goetia” is perhaps the best
example.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary, the
student should do nothing the object of which he does not understand;
also, if he hâve any capacity whatever, he will find his own crude
rituals more effective than the highly polished ones of other
people.</p>
<p>The general purpose of ail this préparation is as follows:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects, if it be
his wish to master one particular idea, he must make every material
object about him directly suggest that idea. Thus, in the ritual quoted,
if his glance fail upon the lights, their number suggests Mercury j he
smells the perfurnes, and again Mercury is brought to his mind. In other
words the whole magical apparatus and ritual is a complex System of
mnemonics.</li>
</ol>
<p>(The importance of these lies principally in the fact that particular
sets of images that the student may meet in his wanderings correspond to
particular lineal figures, divine names, etc. and are controlled by
them. As to the possibility of producing results external to the mind of
the seer (objective in the ordinal y common sense acceptation of the
term) we are here silent.)</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>There are three important practices connected with ail forms of
cérémonial (and the two Methods which later we shall describe).</li>
</ol>
<p>These are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Assumption of God-forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Vibration of Divine Names.</p></li>
<li><p>Rituals of “Banishing” and “Invoking”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These, at least, should be completely mastered before the dangerous
Methods of Chapter V and VI are attempted.</p>
<p>377 —</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Magicai Images of the Gods of Egypt should be made thoroughly
familiar. This can be done by studying them in any public muséum, or in
such books as may be accessible to the student. They should then be
carefully painted by him, both from the model and from memory.</p></li>
<li><p>The student, seated in the “God” position, or in the
characteristic attitude of the God desired, should then imagine His
image as coinciding with his own body, or as enveloping it. This must be
practised until mastery of the image is attained, and an identity with
it and with the God experienced.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain tests
of success in this practice exist.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>The Vibration of God-names. As a further means of identifying the
human consciousness with that pure portion of it which man calls by the
name of some God, let him act thus :</p></li>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Stand with arms outstretched  (See illustration, in Equinox No. 2,
p. 13.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of the
God desired entering with the breath.</p></li>
<li><p>Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the
solar plexus, the navel, the generative organs, and so to the
feet.</p></li>
<li><p>The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance the
left foot about 12 inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands
(drawn back to the side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing
in the typical position of the God Horus, and at the same time imagine
the Name as rushing up and through the body, while you breathe it out
through the nostrils with the air which has been till then retained in
the lungs. Ail this must be done with ail the force of which you are
capable.</p></li>
<li><p>Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger I
2</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I * This injunction does not apply to gods like Phthah or Harpocrates
whose natures do not accord with this gesture.</p>
<p>Or the thumb, the hngers being closed. The thumb symbolises spirit,
the forefinger the element of water.</p>
<p>~ 378 “</p>
<p>upon the lips, so that you are in the characteristic position of the
God Harpocrates.</p>
<ol start="6" type="a">
<li>It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a
single “Vibration” entirely exhausts his physical strength. It should
cause him to grow hot ali over or to perspire violently, and it should
so weaken him that he will find it difficult to remain standing.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it
perceived, when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as
if by the concourse of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to
him as if that Great Voice proceeded from the Universe, and not from
himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both the above practices ail consciousness of anything but the
God-form and name should be absolutely blotted out$ and the longer it
takes for normal perception to return, the better.</p>

<p>The Greater Ritual of the Hexagram.</p>
<p>INVOKING BANISHING</p>
<p>To invoke or banish planets or zodiacal signs.</p>
<p>The Hexagram of Earth alone is used. Draw the hexagram,</p>
<ul>
<li>385 -</li>
</ul>
<p>beginning from the point which is attributed to the pianet you are
dealing with. (See “777” col.lxxxiii). Thus to invoke Jupiter begin from
the right hand point of the iower triangle, dextro- rotary and complété
5 then trace the upper triangle from its left hand point and
complété.</p>
<p>Trace the astrological sigil of the pianet in the centre of your
hexagram.</p>
<p>For the Zodiac use the hexagram of the pianet which rules the sign
you require (“777”, col. xxxviii) but draw the astrological sigil of the
sign, instead of that of the pianet.</p>
<p>For Caput and Cauda Draconis use the lunar hexagram, with the sigil
of or &lt;3</p>
<p>To banish, reverse the hexagram.</p>
<p>In ail cases use a conjuration hrst with Ararita, and next with the
name of the Gocl corresponding to the pianet or sign you are dealing
with.</p>
<p>The Hexagrams pertaining to the planets are as in plate on pre-
ceding page.</p>

<li><p>These rituals should be practised until the figures drawn appear
in flame, in flame so near to physical flame that it would perhaps be
visible to the eyes of a bystander, were one présent. It is alleged that
some persons hâve attained the power of actually kindling fire by these
means. Whether this be so or not, the power is not one to be aimed
at.</p></li>
<li><p>Success in “banishing” is known by a “feeling of cleanliness” in
the atmosphère ; success in “invoking” bv a “feeling of holiness”. It is
unfortunate that these terms are so vague.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But at least make sure of this 5 that any imaginary figure or being
shall instantly obey the will of the student, when he uses the
appropriate figure. In obstinate cases, the forrn of the appropriate God
may be assumed.</p>
<p>386 -</p>
<p>4- The banishing rituals should be used at the commencement of any
ceremony whatever. Next, the student should use a general invocation,
such as the “Preliminary Invocation” in the “Goetia” as well as a
spécial invocation to suit the nature of his working.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Success in these verbal invocations is so subtle a matter, and its
grades so delicately shaded, that it must be left to the good sense of
the student to décidé whether or not he should be satisfied with his
resuit.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="22" type="A">
<li></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let the student be at rest in one of his prescribed positions,
having bathed and robed with the proper décorum. Let the place of
working be free from ail disturbance, and let the preliminary
purifications, banishings and invocations be duly accomplished, and,
lastly, let the incense be kindled.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the proper
magical garments, and armed with the proper magical weapons) as
enveloping his physical body, or standing near to and in front of
him.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him then transfer the seat of his consciousness to that
imagined figure 3 so that it may seem to him that he is seeing with its
eyes, and hearing with its ears.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This will usually be the great difficulty of the operation.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Let him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to a
great height above the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him then stop and look about him. (It is sometimes difficult
to open the eyes.)</p></li>
<li><p>Probably he will see figures approaching him, or become conscious
of a landscape.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon being answered, using
the proper pentagrams and signs, as previously taught.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Let him travel at will, either with or without guidance from such
figure or figures.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him further employ such spécial invocations as will cause to
appear the particular places he may wish to visit.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him beware of the thousand subtle attacks and déceptions that
he will expérience, carefully testing the truth of ail with whom he
speaks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 387 —</p>
<p>Thus a hostile being may appear clothed with glory ; the appropriate
pentagram will in such a case cause him to shrivel or decay.</p>
<p>io. Practice will make the student infinitely wary in such
matters.</p>
<p>il. It is usually quite easy to return to the body, but should any
difficulty arise, practice (again) will make the imagination fertile.
For example, one may create in thought a chariot of fire with white
horses, and command the charioteer to drive earthwaras.</p>
<p>It might be dangerous to go too far, or to stay too long; for fatigue
must be avoided.</p>
<p>The danger spoken of is that of fainting, or of obsession, or of loss
of memory or other mental faculty.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Finally, let the student cause his imagined body in which he
supposes himself to hâve been travelling to coincide with the physical,
tightening his muscles, drawing in his breath, and putting his
forefinger to his lips. Then let him “awake” by a well- defined act of
will, and soberly and accurately record his expériences.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment is
perfectly easy to perform. It is best to learn by “travelling” with a
person already experienced in the matter. Two or three experiments
should suffice to render the student confident and even expert. See also
“The Seer”, pp. 295-333, Equinox I, 2.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few
results of importance. But it is susceptible of a development which
merges into a form of Dharana — concentration — and as such may lead to
the very highest ends. The principal use of the practice in the last
chapter is to familiarise the student with every kind of obstacle and
every kind of delusion, so that he may be perfect master of every idea
that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, to transmute it, to cause it
instantly to obey his will.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him then begin exactly as before, but with the most intense
solemnity and détermination.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to
rise</p></li>
</ol>
<p>388</p>
<p>in a line exactly perpendicular to the earth’s tangent at the point
where his physical body is situated (or to put it more simply, straight
upwards).</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost
overcomes him. If he should find that he has stopped without willing to
do so, and that figures appear, let him at ail costs rise above
them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yea, though his very life tremble on his lips, let him force his way
upward and onward!</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in him.
Whatever threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and ail his
hosts loosed from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from
the very Throne of God Himself that a voice issues bidding him stay and
be content, let him struggle on, ever on.</p></li>
<li><p>At last there must corne a moment when his whole being is
swallowed up in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia. 1 Let him sink
(when no longer can he strive, though his tongue be bitten through with
the effort and the blood gush from his nostrils) into the blackness of
unconsciousness, and then, on coming to himself, let him Write down
soberly and accurately a record of ail that hath occurred, yea a record
of ail that hath occurred.</p></li>

<ol start="15" type="a">
<li>Fhis is the Book of Uniting Himself to a particular Deity by
dévotion.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Considerattons before the Threshold :— First concermng the ch01
ce of a particular Deity. Fhis matter is of no import, sobeit that thou
choose one suited to thine own highest nature. Howsoever, this method is
not so suitable for gods austere as Saturn, or intellectual as Thoth.
But for such deities as in them- selves partake in anywise of love ît is
a perfect mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning the frime method of this Magick Art : — Let the
devotee consider well that although Christ and Osiris be one, yet the
former is to be worshipped with Christian, and the latter with Egyptian,
rites. And this, although the rites themselves are ceremonially
équivalent. There should, however, be one symbol declaring the
transcending of such limitations 3 and with regard to the Deity also,
there should be some one affirmation of his identity both with ail other
similar gods of other nations, and with the Suprême of whom ail are but
partial reflections.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3 - Concerning the chief flace of dévotion: —- This is the Heart of
the Devotee, and should be symbolically represented by that room or spot
which he loves best. And the dearest spot therein shall be the shrine of
his temple. It is most convenient if this shrine and altar should be
sequestered in woods, or in a private grove, or garden. But let it be
protected from the profane.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Image of the Deity: — Let there be an image of the
Deityj first because in méditation there is mindfulness induced thereby;
and second because a certain power enters and inhabits it by virtue of
the ceremonies 5 or so it is said, and We deny it not. Let this image be
the most beautiful and perfect which the devotee is able to procure ; or
if he be able to paint or to carve the same, it is ail the better. As
for Deities with whose nature no Image is compatible, let them be
worshipped in an</li>
</ol>
<p>— 390</p>
<p>empty shrine. Such are Brahma, and Allah. Also some post- captivity
conceptions of Jéhovah.</p>
<p>5- Further concerning the shrine. — Let this shrine be furnished
appropriately as to its ornaments, according to the book 777. With ivy
and pine-cones, that is to say, for Bacchus, and let lay before him both
grapes and wine. So also for Ceres let there be corn, and cakes ; or for
Diana moon-wort and pale herbs, and pure water. Further it is well to
support the shrine with talismans of the planets, signs and éléments
appropriate. But these should be made according to the right Ingenium of
the Philosophus by the light of the book 777 during the course of his
Dévotion. It is also well, nevertheless, if a magick circle with the
right signs and names be made beforehand.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Ceremonies: — Let the Philosophus préparé a powerful
Invocation of the particular Deity according to his Ingenium. But let it
consist of these several parts: —</li>
</ol>
<p>First, an Imprécation, as of a slave unto his Lord.</p>
<p>Second, an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege.</p>
<p>Third, a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent.</p>
<p>Fourth, an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God.</p>
<p>Fifth, a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother.</p>
<p>Sixth, a Conjuration, as to a Friend with his Friend.</p>
<p>Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress.</p>
<p>And mark well that the first should be of awe, the second of fealty,
the third of dependence, the fourth of adoration, the fifth of
confidence, the sixth of comradeship, the seventh of passion.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Further concerning the ceremonies. — Let then this Invoca¬ tion
be the principal part of an ordered ceremony. And in this ceremony let
the Philosophus in no wise neglect the service of a memal. Let him sweep
and garnish the place, sprinkling it with water or with wine as is
appropriate to the particular Deity, and consecrating it with oil, and
with such ritual as may seem him best. And let ail be done with
intensity and minuteness.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning the feriod of dévotion , and the hours thereof: — Let
a fixed period be set for the worship ; and it is said that the least
time is nine days by seven, and the greatest seven years by nine. And
concerning the hours, let the Ceremony be performed</p></li>
</ol>
<p>391</p>
<p>every day thrice, or at least once, and let the sleep of the
Philosophus be broken for some purpose of dévotion at least once in
every night.</p>
<p>Now to some it may seem best to appoint fixed hours for the ceremony.
To others it may seem that the ceremony should be performed as the
spirit moves them so to do 3 for this there is no rule.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Concernlng the Robes and Instruments : — The Wand and Cup are to be
chosen for this Art 3 never the Sword or Dagger, never the Pantacle,
unless that Pantacle chance to be of a nature harmonious. But even so it
is best to keep to the Wand and the Cup, and if one must choose, the
Cup.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the’Robes, that of a Philosophus, or that of an Adept Within is
most suitable3 or the robe best fitted for the service of the particular
Deity, as a bassara for Bacchus, a white robe for Vesta. So also for
Vesta, one might use for instrument the Lampj or the sickle, for
Chronos.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>Concernlng the Incense and Libations. — The incense should follow
the nature of the particular Deity, as, mastic for Mercury, dittany for
Persephone. Also the libations, as, a décoc¬ tion of nightshade for
Melancholia, or of Indian hemp for Uranus.</p></li>
<li><p>Concernlng the harmony of the ceremonies: — Let ail these things
be rightly considered, and at length, in language of the utmost beauty
at the command of the Philosophus, accom- panied, if he has skill, by
music, and interwoven, if the particular Deity be jocund, with dancing.
And ail being carefully prepared and rehearsed let it be practised daily
until it be wholly rhythmical with his aspirations, and as it were, a
part of his being.</p></li>
<li><p>Concernlng the variety of the ceremonies. — Now, seeing that
every man differeth essentially from every other man, albeit in essence
he is identical, let also these ceremonies assert their identity by
their diversity. For this reason do we leave much herein to the right
Ingenium of the Philosophus.</p></li>
<li><p>Concernlng the life of the devotee. -— First let his way of life
be such as is pleasing to the particular Deity. Thus to invoke Neptune,
let him go a-fishing3 but if Hades, let him not approach the water that
is hateful to Him.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>392</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>Further , concerrimg the life of the devotee: — Let him eut away
from his life any act, word or thought, that is hateful to the
particular Deity; as, unchastity in the case of Artémis, évasions in the
case of Ares. Besides this, he should avoid ail harshness or unkindness
of any kind in thought, word, or deed, seeing that above the particular
Deity is One in whom ail is One.  et also he may deliberately practise
cruelties, where the particular Deity manifests His Love in that manner,
as in the case of Kali, and of Pan. And therefore, before the beginning
of his periods of dévotion, let him practise according to the rules of
Liber Jugorum.</p></li>
<li><p>Further concerning the life of the devotee: — Now, as many are
fully occupied with their affairs, let it be known that this method is
adaptable to the necessities of ail.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And We bear witness that this which followeth is the Crux and
Quintessence of the whole Method.</p>
<p>First, if he hâve no Image, let him take anything soever, and
consecrate it as an Image of his God. Likewise with his robes and
instruments, his suffumigations and libations ; for his Robe hath he not
a nightdress; for his instrument a walking stick ; for his suf-
fumigation a burning match ; for his libation a glass of water ?</p>
<p>But let him consecrate each thing that he useth to the service of
that particular Deity, and not profane the same to any other use.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>Continuation . Next, concerning his time if it be short. Let him
labour mentally with his Invocation, concentrating it, and let him
perform this Invocation in his heart whenever he hath the leisure. And
let him seize eagerly upon every opportunity for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuation. — Third, even if he hâve leisure and pré¬ paration,
let him seek ever to bring inward the symbols, so that even in his well
ordered shrine the whole ceremony revolve inwardly in his heart, that is
to say in the temple of his body, of which the outer temple is but an
image.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For in the brain is the shrine, and there is no Image therein; and
the breath of man is the incense and the libation.</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li>Continuation . — Further concerning occupation. Let the devotee
transmute within the alembic of his heart every thought, or word, or act
into the spiritual gold of his dévotion.</li>
</ol>
<p>393</p>
<p>As thus : eating. Let him say, a I eat this food in gratitude to my
Deity that hath sent it to me, in order to gain strength for my dévotion
to Him.”</p>
<p>Or: sleeping. Let him say, “I lie down to sleep, giving thanks for
this blessing from my Deity, in order that I may he refreshed for new
dévotion to Him.”</p>
<p>Or: reading. Let him say: “I read this book that I may study the
nature of my Deity, that further knowledge of Him may inspire me with
deeper dévotion to Him.”</p>
<p>Or: working. Let him say: “I drive my spade into the earth that fresh
flowers (fruit, or what not) may spring up to His glory, and that I,
purified by toil, may give better dévotion to Him.”</p>
<p>Or: whatever it may be that he is doing, let him reason it out in his
mind, drawing it through circumstance and circumstance to that one end
and conclusion of the matter. And let him not perform the act until he
hath done this.</p>
<p>As it is written : Liber VII, Cap. 5. —</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li>a Every breath, every word, every thought is an act of love</li>
</ol>
<p>with thee.</p>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li><p>“The beat of my heart is the pendulum of love.</p></li>
<li><p>“The songs of me are the soft sighs.</p></li>
<li><p>“The thoughts of me are very rapture.</p></li>
<li><p>“And my deeds are the myriads of Thy Children, the stars</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and the atoms.”</p>
<p>And Remember Well, that if thou wert in truth a lover, ail this
wouldst thou do of thine own nature without the slightest flaw or
failure in the minutest part thereof.</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Lections. — Let the Philosophus read solely in his
copies of the holy books of Thelema, during the whole period of his
dévotion. But if he weary, then let him read books which hâve no part
whatever in love, as for récréation.</li>
</ol>
<p>But let him copy out each verse of Thelema which bears upon this
matter, and ponder them, and comment thereupon. For therein is a wisdom
and a magick too deep to utter in any other wise.</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Méditations. — Herein is the most potent method of
attaining unto the End, for him who is thoroughly prepared, being
purified by the practice of the Transmutation of</li>
</ol>
<p>“ 394 —</p>
<p>deed into dévotion, and consecrated by the right performance of the
holy ceremonies. Yet herein is danger, for that the Mind is fluid as
quicksilver, and bordereth upon the Abyss, and is beset by many sirens
and devils that seduce and attack it to destroy it. Therefore let the
devotee beware, and précisé accurately his médi¬ tations, even as a man
should build a canal from sea to sea.</p>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li>Continuation. — Let then the Philosophus meditate upon ail J ove
that hath ever stirred him. There is the love of David and of Jonathan,
and the love of Abraham and Isaac, and the love of Lear and Cordelia,
and the love of Damon and Pythias, and the love of Sappho and Atthis,
and the love of Romeo and Juliet, and the love of Dante and Béatrice,
and the love of Paolo and Frances- ca, and the love of Caesar and
Lucrezia Borgia, and the love of Aucassin and Nicolette, and the love of
Daphnis and Chloe, and the love of Cornelia and Caius Gracchus, and the
love of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the love of Cupid and Psyché, and the
love of Endymion and Artémis, and the love of Demeter and Persephone,
and the love of Venus and Adonis, and the love of Lakshmi and Vishnu,
and the love of Siva and Bhavani and the love of Buddha and Ananda, and
the love of Jésus and John, and many more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also there is the love of many saints for their particular deity, as
of St Francis of Assisi for Christ, of Sri Sabhapaty Swami for
Maheswara, of Abdullah Haji Shirazi for Allah, of St Ignatius Loyola for
Mary, and many more.</p>
<p>Now do thou take one such story every night, and enact it in thy
mind, grasping each identity with infinité care and zest, and do thou
figure thyself as one of the lovers and thy Deity as the other. Thus do
thou pass through ail adventures of love, not omitting one 3 and to each
do thou conclude : How pale a reflection is this of my love for this
Deity!</p>
<p>Yet from each shalt thou draw some knowledge of love, some intimacy
with love, that shall aid thee to perfect thy love. Thus learn the
humility of love from one, its obedience from another, its intensity
from a third, its purity from a fourth, its peace from yet a fifth.</p>
<p>So then thy love being made perfect, it shall be worthy of that
perfect love of His.</p>
<p>— 395 ~</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li><p>Further concerning méditation. — Moreover let the Philosophus
imagine to himself that he hath indeed succeeded in his dévotion, and
that his Lord hath appeared to him, and that they converse as may be
fitting.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning the JVLysterious Triangle. — Now as three cords
separately may be broken by a child, while those same cords duly twisted
may bind a giant, let the Philosophus learn to entwine these three
methods of Magick into a Spell.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To this end let him understand that as they are One, because the end
is One, so are they One because the method is One, even the method of
turning the mind toward the particular Deity by love in every act.</p>
<p>And lest thy twine slip, here is a little cord that wrappeth tighdy
round and round ail, even the Mantram or Continuous Prayer.</p>
<ol start="24" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Aîantram or Continuous Prayer. — Let the Philosophus
weave the Name of the particular Deity into a sentence short and
rhythmical, as, for Artémis: èttsXGgv, èTusXOov, ApT£fJuç ; or, for
Shiva : Namo Shivaya namaha Aum 3 or, for Mary 3 Ave Maria3 or for Pan,
Xoups HcoTY)p Koopiou, Ito Ilav, Ico Uav ; or, for Allah, Hua Allahu
alazi lailaha ilia Hua.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let him repeat this day and night without cessation mechanically in
his brain, which is thus made ready for the Advent of that Lord, and
armed against ail other.</p>
<ol start="25" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Active and the Passive. — Let the Philo¬ sophus
change from the active love of his particular deity to a State of
passive waiting, even almost a repulsion, the repulsion not of distaste,
but of a sublime modesty.</li>
</ol>
<p>As it is written, Liber LXV. ii. 59, “I hâve called unto thee, and I
hâve journeyed with Thee, and it availed me not.” 60. “I waited
patiently, and Thou wast with me from the beginning.”</p>
<p>Then let him change back to the Active, until a véritable rhythm is
established between the States, as it were the swinging of a pen- dulum.
But let him reflect that a vast intelligence is required for this 3 for
he must stand as it were almost without himself to watch those phases of
himself, And to do this is an high Art, and per- taineth not altogether
to the grade of Philosophus. Neither is it of itself helpful, but rather
the reverse in this especial practice.</p>
<p>— 39b</p>
<ol start="26" type="1">
<li><p>Concerning silence. — Now there may corne a time in the course of
this practice when the outward symbols of dévotion cease, when the soûl
is as it were dumb in the presence of its God. Mark that this is not a
cessation but a transmutation of the barren seed of prayer into the
green shoot of yearning. This yearning is spon- taneous, and it shall be
left to grow, whether is be sweet or bitter. For often times it is as
the torment of hell in which the soûl burns and writhes unceasingly. Yet
it ends, and at its end continue openly thy Method.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning Dryness. — Another State wherein at times the soûl may
fall is this dark night. And this is indeed purifying, in such depths
that the soûl cannot fathom it. It is less like pain than like death.
But it is the necessary death that cornes before the rising of a body
glorified.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This State must be endured with fortitude; and no means of
alleviating it may be employed. It may be broken up by the breaking up
of the whole Method, and a return to the world without. This cowardice
not only destroys the value of ail that has gone before, but destroys
the value of the Oath of Fealty that thou hast sworn, and makes thy Will
a mockery to men and gods.</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Feceftions of the Devil. — Note well that in this
State of dryness a thousand séductions will lure thee away; also a
thousand means of breaking thine oath in spirit without breaking it in
letter. Against this thou mayst repeat the words of thine oath aloud
again and again until the temptation be overcome.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also the devil will represent to thee that it were much better for
this operation that thou do thus and thus, and seek to affright thee by
fears for thy health or thy reason.</p>
<p>Or he may send against thee visions worse than madness.</p>
<p>Against ail this there is but one remedy, the Discipline of thine
Oath. So then thou shalt go through ceremonies meaningless and hideous
to thee, and blasphémé shalt thou against thy Deity and curse Him. And
this mattereth little, for it is not thou, so be that thou adhéré to the
Letter of thine Obligation. For thy Spiritual Sight is closed, and to
trust it is to be led into the précipice, and hurled therefrom.</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>Further of this matter. — Now also subtler than ail these</li>
</ol>
<p>— 397 —</p>
<p>terrors are the Illusions of Success. But one instant’s
self-satisfac¬ tion or Expansion of thy Spirit, especially in this State
of dryness, and thou art lost. For thou mayst attain the False Union
with the Démon himself. Beware also of even the pride which rises from
having resisted the temptations.</p>
<p>But so many and so subtle are the wiles of Choronzon that the whole
world could not contain their énumération.</p>
<p>The answer to one and ail is the persistence in the literal fulfil-
ment of the routine. Beware, then, last, of that devil who shall whisper
in thine ear that the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life, and
answer : Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it
abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>
<p>Yet shalt thou also beware of disputation with the devil and pride in
the cleverness of thine answers to him. Therefore, if thou hast not lost
the power of silence, let it be hrst and last employed against him.</p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li>Concerning the Enflaming of the Heart. — Now learn that thy methods
are dry, one and ail. Intellectual exercises, moral exercises, they are
not Love. Yet as a man, rubbing two dry sticks together for long,
suddenly found a spark, so also from time to time will true Love leap
unasked into thy méditation. Yet this shall die and be reborn again and
again. It may be that thou hast no tinder near.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end shall corne suddenly a great flame and devouring, and burn
thee utterly.</p>
<p>Now of these sparks, and of these splutterings of flame, and of these
beginnings of the Infinité Fire, thou shalt thus be aware. For the
sparks thy heart shall leap up, and thy ceremony or médi¬ tation or toil
shall seem of a sudden to go of its own will 3 and for the little fiâmes
this shall be increased in volume and intensity; and for the beginnings
of the Infinité Fire thy ceremony shall be caught up unto ravishing
song, and thy méditation shall be ecstasy, and thy toil shall be a
delight exceeding ail pleasure thou hast ever known.</p>
<p>And of the Great Flame that answereth thee it may not be spoken; for
therein is the End of this Magick Art of Dévotion.</p>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li>Considérations with regard to the use of symbols. It is to</li>
</ol>
<p>— 398 —</p>
<p>be noted that persons of powerful imagination, will, and intelligence
hâve no need of these material symbols. There hâve been certain saints
who are capable of love for an idea as such without it being otherwise
than degraded by idolising it, to use this Word in its true sense. Thus
one may be impassioned of beauty, without even the need of so small a
concrétion of it as “The beauty of Apollo”, the “beauty of roses”, the
“beauty of Attis”. Such persons are rare 5 it may be doubted whether
Plato himself attained to any vision of absolute beauty without
attaching to it material objects in the first place. A second class is
able to contemplate ideals through this veil 5 a third class need a
double veil, and cannot think of the beauty of a rose without a rose
before them. For such, is this Method of most use 5 yet let them know
that there is this danger therein, that they may mistake the gross body
of the symbol for the idea made concrète thereby.</p>
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li>Considérations of further danger to those not purged of material
thought. — Let it be remembered that in the nature of the love itself is
danger. The lust of the satyr for the nymph is indeed of the same nature
as the affinity of quicklime for water en the one hand, and of love of
Ab for Ama on the otherj so also is the triad Osiris, Isis, Horus like
that of a horse, mare, foal, and of red, blue, purple. And this is the
foundation of Correspondences.</li>
</ol>
<p>But it were false to say “Horus is a foal” or “Horus is purple”. One
may say : “Horus resembles a foal in this respect that he is the
olfspring of two complementary beings”.</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li>Further of this matter .— So also many hâve said truly that since
earth is that One, and océan is that One, therefore earth is océan. Unto
Him good is illusion, and evil is illusion 5 therefore good is evil. By
this fallacy of logic are many men destroyed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, there are those who take the image for the God; as who
should say, my heart is in Tiphereth, an Adeptus is in Tiphereth; I am
therefore an adept.</p>
<p>And in this practice the worst danger is this, that the love which is
its weapon should fail in one of two ways.</p>
<p>First, if the love lack any quality of love, so long is it not idéal
love. For it is written of the Perfected One: “There is no member of my
body which is not the member of some god.” Therefore</p>
<p>— 399 ~</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>7</p>
<p>let not the Philosophus despise any form of love, but harmonise ail.
As it is written: Liber LXV. 32. a So therefore Perfection abideth not
in the Pinnacles or in the Foundation, but in the harmony of One with
ail.”</p>
<p>Second, if any part of this love exceed, there is disease therein.
As, in the love of Othello for Desdemona, lovées jealousy over- came
love’s tenderness, so may it be in in this love of a particular Deity.
And this is more likely, since in this divine love no élément may be
omitted.</p>
<p>It is by virtue of this completeness that no human love may in a 113/
way attain to more than to foreshadow a little part thereof.</p>
<ol start="34" type="1">
<li>Concerning Mortifications. — These are not necessary to this method.
On the contrary, they may destroy the concentration, as
counter-irritants to, and so alleviations of, the suprême mortifi¬
cation which is the Absence of the Deity invoked.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet as in mortal love arises a distaste for food, or a pleasure in
things naturally painful, this perversion should be endured and allowed
to take its course. Yet not to the interférence with natural bodily
health, whereby the instrument of the soûl might be impaired.</p>
<p>And concerning sacrifices for love’s sake, they are natural to this
Method, and right.</p>
<p>But concerning voluntary privations and tortures, without use save as
against the devotee, they are generally not natural to healthy natures,
and wrong. For they are selfish. To scourge one’s self serves not one’s
master 3 yet to deny one’s self bread that one’s child may hâve cake is
the act of a true mother.</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>Further concerning Mortifications .—If thy body, on which thou
ridest, be so disobedient a beast that by no means will he travel in the
desired direction, or if thy mind be baulkish and éloquent as Balaam’s
fabled Ass, then let the practice be abandoned. Let the shrine be
covered in sackcloth, and do thou put on habits of lamentation, and
abide alone. And do thou return most austerely to the practice of Liber
Jugorum, testing thyself by a standard higher than that hitherto
accomplished, and punishing effractions with a heavier goad. Nor do thou
return to thy dévotion until</li>
</ol>
<p>400</p>
<p>that body and mind are tamed and trained to ail manner of peaceable
going.</p>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li><p>Concerning minor adjuvant in the ceremonies. — I. Rising on the
planes. — B y this method mayst thou assist the imagination at the time
of concluding thine Invocation. Act as taught in Liber Q, by the light
of Liber 777.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. — IL
Talismanic Magic. — Having made by thine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle
to represent the particular Deity, and conse- crated it with infinité
love and care, do thou burn it ceremonially before the shrine, as if
thereby giving up the shadow for the substance. But it is useless to do
this unless thou do really in thine heart value the talisman beyond ail
else that thou hast.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the Ceremonies . —</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>Rehearsal. — It may assist if the traditional history of the
particular Deity be rehearsed before him; perhaps this is best done in
dramatic form. This method is the main one recommended in the
“Exercitios Espirituales” of St. Ignatius, whose work may be taken as a
model. Let the Philosophus work out the legend of his own particular
Deity, and apportioning days to events, live that life in imagination,
exercising the five senses in turn, as occasion arises.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li>Concerning minor matters adjuvant in the ceremonies. —</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>Dur esse. — This method consists in cursing a deity récalci¬ trant ;
as, threatening ceremonially ££ to burn the blood of Osiris, and to
grind down his bones to powder.” This method is alto- gether contrary to
the spirit of love unless the particular Deity be himself savage and
relentless; as Jéhovah or Kali. In such a case the desire to perform
constraint and cursing may be the sign of the assimilation of the spirit
of the devotee with that of his God, and so an advance to the Union with
Him.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li>Concerning the value of this particular form of Union or Samadhi: —
Ail Samadhi is defined as the ecstatic union of subject and object in
consciousness, with the resuit that a third thing arises which partakes
in no way of the nature of the two.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would seem at first sight that it is of no importance whatever to
choose an object of méditation. For example, the Samadhi</p>
<p>401 —</p>
<p>called Atmadarshana might arise from simple concentration of the
thought on an imagined triangle or on the heart.</p>
<p>But as the union of two bodies in chemistry may be endothermie or
exothermic, the combination of Oxygen with Nitrogen is gentle, while
that of Oxygen with Hydrogen is explosive 5 and as it is found that the
most heat is disengaged as a rule by the union of bodies most opposite
in character, and that the compound resulting from such is most stable,
so it seems reasonable to suggest that the most important and enduring
Samadhi results from the contempla¬ tion of the Object most opposite to
the devotee.</p>
<p>On other planes, it has been suggested that the most opposed types
make the best marriages and produce the healthiest children. The
greatest pictures and opéras are those in which violent extremes are
blended, and so generally in every field of activity. Even in
mathematics, the greatest parallelogram is formed if the lines composing
it are set at right angles.</p>
<ol start="41" type="1">
<li>Conclusions from the foregoing. — It may then be suggested to the
Philosophus, that although his work will be harder his reward will be
greater if he choose a Deity most remote from his own nature. This
method is harder and higher than that of Liber E. For a simple object as
there suggested is of the same nature as the commonest things of life,
while even the meanest Deity is beyond uninitiated human understanding.
On the same plane, too, Venus is nearer to man than Aphrodite, Aphrodite
than Isis, Isis than Babalon, Babalon than Nuit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let him décidé therefore according to his discrétion on the one hand
and his aspiration on the other ; and let not one overrun his
fellow.</p>
<ol start="42" type="1">
<li>Further concerning the value of this Method. — Certain objections
arise. Firstly, in the nature of ail human love is illusion, and a
certain blindness. Nor is there any true love below the Veil of the
Abyss. For this reason we give this method to the Philoso¬ phus, as the
reflection of the Exempt Adept, who reflects the Magister Templi and the
Magus. Let then the Philosophus attain this Method as a foundation of
the higher Methods to be given to him when he attains those higher
grades.</li>
</ol>
<p>402</p>
<p>Ànother objection lies in the partiality of this Method. This is
equally a defect characteristic of the Grade.</p>
<ol start="43" type="1">
<li>Concerning a notable danger of Success. — It may occur that owing to
the tremendous power of the Samadhi, overcoming ail other memories as it
should and does do, that the mind of the devotee may be obsessed, so
that he déclaré his particular Deity to be sole God and Lord. This error
has been the foundation of ail dogmatic religions, and so the cause of
more misery than ail other errors combined.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Philosophus is peculiarly liable to this because from the nature
of the Method he cannot remain sceptical; he must for the time believe
in his particular Deity. But let him (1) consider that this belief is
only a weapon in his hands, and (2) affirm sufficiently that his Deity
is but an émanation or reflection or eidolon of a Being beyond him, as
was said in Paragraph 2. For if he fail herein, since man cannot remain
permanently in Samadhi, the memorised Image in his mind will be
degraded, and replaced by the corresponding Démon, to his utter
ruin.</p>
<p>Therefore, after Success, let him not delight overmuch in his Deity,
but rather busy himself with his other work, not permitting that which
is but a step to become a goal. As it is written, Liber CLXXXV:
“remembering that Philosophy is the Equilibrium of him that is in the
House of Love.”</p>
<ol start="44" type="1">
<li>Concerning secrecy and the rites of Blood. —During this practice it
is most wise that the Philosophus utter no Word con¬ cerning his
working, as if it were a Forbidden Love that consumeth him. But let him
answer fools according to their folly; for since he cannot conceal his
love from his fellows, he must speak to them as they may
understand.</li>
</ol>
<p>And as many Deities demand sacrifice, one of men, another of cattle,
a third of doves, let these sacrifices be replaced by the true
sacrifices in thine own heart. Yet if thou must symbolise them outwardly
for the hardness of thine heart, let thine own blood and no other’s, be
spilt before that altar. 1</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The exceptions to this rule pertain neither to this practice, nor to
this grade. N. Fra. A A</li>
</ol>
<p>403 —</p>
<p>Nevertheless, forget not that this practice is dangerous, and may
cause the manifestation of evil things, hostile and malicious, to thy
great hurt.</p>
<ol start="45" type="1">
<li><p>Concerning a further sacrifice. — Of this it shall be under-
stood that nothing is to be spoken; nor need anything be spoken to him
that hath wisdom to comprehend the number of the para- graph. And this
sacrifice is fatal beyond all,unless it be a sacrificium indeed. Yet
there are those who hâve dared and achieved thereby.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning yet a further sacrifice. — Here it is spoken of actual
mutilation. Such acts are abominable ; and while thev may bring success
in this Method, form an absolute bar to ail further progress.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And they are in any case more likely to lead to madness than to
Samadhi. He indeed who purposeth them is already mad.</p>
<ol start="47" type="1">
<li><p>Concerning human affection. — During this practice thou shalt in
no wise withdraw thyself from human relations, only figuring to thyself
that thy father or thy brother or thy wife is as it were an image of thy
particular Deity. Thus shall they gain, and not lose, by thy working.
Only in the case of thy wife this is difficult, since she is more to
thee than ail others, and in this case thou mayst act with tempérance,
lest her personality overcome and destroy that of thy Deity.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning the Holy Guardian Angel.’ —Do thou in no wise confuse
this invocation with that.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bénédiction. — And so may the love that passeth ail
Understanding keep your hearts and minds through IAÜ AAONAI 2 ABAQ and
through BABALON of the City of the Pyramids, and through Astarté, the
Starry One green-girdled, in the name ARARITA. Amen.</p></li>

<p>SUB FIGURA CCVL</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Let the Zelator observe the current of his breath.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him investigate the following statements, and préparé a
careful record of research.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Certain actions induce the flow of the breath through the right
nostril (Pingala) 5 and, conversely, the flow of the breath through
Pingala induces certain actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain other actions induce the flow of the breath through the
left nostril (Ida), and conversely.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet a third class of actions induce the flow of the breath
through both nostrils at once (Sushumna), and conversely.</p></li>
<li><p>The degree of mental and physical activity is interdependent with
the distance from the nostrils at which the breath can be felt by the
back of the hand.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>First practice. — Let him concentrate his mind upon the act of
breathing, saying mentally, “The breath flows in”, “the breath flows
out”, and record the results. [This practice may résolve itself into
Mahasatipatthana (vide Liber XXV) or induce Samadhi. Whichever occurs
should be followed up as the right Ingenium of the Zelator, or the
advice of his Practicus, may détermine.]</p></li>
<li><p>Second practice. Pranayama. — This is outlined in Liber E.
Further, let the Zelator accomplished in those practices endeavour to
master a cycle of 10, 20, 40 or even 16, 32, 64. But let this be done
gradually and with due caution. And when he is steady and easy both in
Asana and Pranayama, let him still further increase the period.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus let him investigate these statements which follow: —</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>If Pranayama be properly performed, the body will first of ail
become covered with sweat. This sweat is different in character from
that customarily induced by exertion. If the Practitioner rub this sweat
thoroughly into his body, he will greatly strengthen it.</li>
</ol>
<p>405</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>The tendency to perspiration will stop as the practice is continue^
and the body become automatically rigid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Describe this rigidity with minute accuracy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>The State of automatic rigidity will develop into a State
characterised by violent spasmodic movements of which the Practitioner
is unconscious, but of whose resuit he is aware. This resuit is that the
body hops gently from place to place. After the first two or three
occurrences of this expérience, Asana is not lost. The body appears (on
another theory) to hâve lost its weight almost completely and to be
moved by an unknown force.</p></li>
<li><p>As a development of this stage, the body rises into the air, and
remains there for an appreciably long period, from a second to an hour
or more.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let him further investigate any mental results w’hich may occur.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Third Practice . — In order both to économisé his time and to
develop his powers, let the Zelator practise the deep full breathing
which his preliminary exercises will hâve taught him during his walks.
Let him repeat a sacred sentence (mantra) or let him count, in such a
way that his footfall beats accurately with the rhythm thereof, as is
done in dancing. Then let him practise Pranayama, at first without the
Kumbhakam, and paying no atten¬ tion to the nostrils otherwise than to
keep them clear. Let him begin by an indrawing of the breath for 4
paces, and a breathing out for 4 paces. Let him increase this gradually
to 6.6, 8.8, 12.12, 16.16 and 24.24, or more if he be able. Next let him
practise in the proper proportion 4.8, 6.12, 8.16, 12.24 and so on. Then
if he choose, let him recommence the sériés, adding a gradually
increasing period of Kumbhakam.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth fractice. — Following on this third practice, let him
quicken his mantra and his pace until the walk develops into a dance.
This may also be practised with the ordinary waltz step, using a mantra
in three-time, such as iizzküov, étusAÔov, ApTspaç;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>or Iaoj Iao Sabao; in such cases the practice may be combined with
dévotion to a particular deity: see Liber CLXXV. For the dance as such
it is better to use a mantra of a non-committal character, such as J 0
aval, lo KaAov, To Ayaôov, or the like.</p>
<p>— 406</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Fifth practice. — Let him practice mental concentration during the
dance, and investigate the following experiments:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The dance becomes independent of the will.</p></li>
<li><p>Similar phenomena to those described in 5 (a), (b), (c),
(d),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>occur.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>A note concerning the depth and fullness of the breathing. In ail
proper expiration the last possible portion of air should be expelled.
In this the muscles of the throat, chest, ribs, and abdomen must be
fully employed, and aided by the pressing of the upper arms into the
flanks, and of the head into the thorax.</li>
</ol>
<p>In ail proper inspiration the last possible portion of air must be
drawn into the lungs.</p>
<p>In ail proper holding of the breath, the body must remain absolutely
still.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of such practice is ample to induce profuse sweating in
any place of a température of 17 0 C. or over.</p>
<p>The progress of the Zelator in acquiring a depth and fullness of
breath should be tested by the respirometer.</p>
<p>The exercises should be carefully graduated to avoid overstrain and
possible damage to the lungs.</p>
<p>This depth and fullness of breath should be kept as much as possible,
even in the rapid exercises, with the exception of the sixth practice
following.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Sixth Practice. — Let the Zelator breathe as shallowly and rapidly
as possible. He should assume the attitude of his moment of greatest
expiration, and breathe only with the muscles of his throat. He may also
practice lengthening the period between each shallow breathing.</li>
</ol>
<p>(This may be combined, when acquired, with concentration on the
Visuddhi cakkra, i.e. let him fix his mind unwaveringly upon a point in
the spine opposite the larynx.)</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Seventh practice. — Let the Zelator practise restraint of breathing
in the following manner. At any stage of breathing let him suddenly hold
the breath, enduring the need to breathe until it passes, returns, and
passes again, and so on until consciousness is lost, either rising to
Samadhi or similar supernormal condition, or falling into oblivion.</li>
</ol>
<p>407 —</p>
<p>13- Ninth practice .—Let him practice the usual forms of Pranayama,
but let Kumbhakarn be used after instead of before expiration. Let him
gradually increase the period of this Kumbhakarn as in the case of the
other.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>A note concerning the conditions of these experiments.</li>
</ol>
<p>The conditions favourable are dry, bracing air, a warm climate,</p>
<p>absence of wind, absence of noise, insects and ail other disturbing
influences, 1 a retired situation, simple food eaten in great modéra¬
tion at the conclusion of the practices of morning and afternoon, and on
no account before practising. Bodily health is almost essential, and
should be most carefully guarded (See Liber CLXXXV, Task of a Néophyte
). A diligent and tractable disciple, or the Practicus of the Zelator,
should aid him in his work. Such a disciple should be noiseless,
patient, vigilant, prompt, cheerful, of gentle manner and reverent to
his master, intelligent to anticipate his wants, cleanly and gracious,
not given to speech, devoted and unselfish. With ail this he should be
fierce and terrible to strangers and ail hostile influences, determined
and vigorous, increasingly vigilant, the guardian of the threshold.</p>
<p>It is not désirable that the Zelator should employ any other créature
than a man, save in cases of necessity. Yet for some of these purposes a
dog will serve, for others a woman. There are also others appointed to
serve, but these are not for the Zelator.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><p>Tenth practice. — Let the Zelator experiment if he will with
inhalations of oxygen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and other gases
mixed in small proportion with his air during his practices. These
experiments are to be conducted with caution in the presence of a
medical man of expérience, and they are only useful as facilitating a
simulacrum of the results of the proper practices and thereby
enheartening the Zelator.</p></li>
<li><p>Kleventh practice. — Let the Zelator at any time during the
practices, especially during the periods of Kumbhakarn, throw his will
utterly towards his Holy Guardian Angel, directing his eyes inward and
upward, and turning back his tongue as if to swallow it.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that in the early stages of concentration of the mind, such
annoyances become negligible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>408 —</p>
<p>(This latter operation is facilitated by severing the fraenum linguæ,
which, if done, shouJd be done by a competent surgeon. We do not advise
this or any similar method of cheating difficultés. This is, however,
harmless.)</p>
<p>In this manner the practice is to be raised from the physical to the
spiritual plane, even as the words Ruh, Ruach, Pneuma, Spiritus, Geist,
Ghost, and indeed words of almost ail languages, hâve been raised from
their physical meaning of wind, breath, or movement, to the spiritual
plane. (RV is the old root meaning Yoni and hence Wheel (Fr. roue, Lat.
rota, wheel) and the corresponding Semitic root means “to go”. Similarly
spirit is connected with “spiral”. — Ed.)</p>

been made throughout the course of this instruction, and reflect that
even the counsel which we hâve given as suitable to the average case may
be entirely unsuitable to his own.</p>

the Many may be melted to that of the One.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>FIRST METHOD</p>
<p>O. Let a magical circle be constructed, and within it an upright Tau
drawn upon the ground. Let this Tau be devised into io squares (See
Liber CMLXIII., Illustration i.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let the magician be armed with the Sword of Art. 1</p></li>
<li><p>Let him wear the black robe of a Néophyte.</p></li>
<li><p>Let a single flame of camphor burn at the top of the Tau, and let
there be no other light or ornament. 1</p></li>
</ol>
<p>4- Let him “open” the Temple as in DCLXXI or in any other convenient
manner.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Standing at the appropriate quarters, at the edge of the circle,
let him banish the 5 éléments by the appropriate rituals.</p></li>
<li><p>Standing at the edge of the circle, let him banish the 7 planets
by the appropriate rituals. Let him face the actual position of each
planet in the heavens at the time of his working.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him further banish the twelve signs of the Zodiac by the
appropriate rituals, facing each sign in turn.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him at each of these 24 banishings make three
circumambulations widdershins, with the signs of Horus and Harpocrates
in the East as he passes it.</p></li>
<li><p>In circumstances where this is inappropriate let him be armed
with wand and lamp instead of as in text. — N.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 410</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>Let him advance to the square of Malkuth in the Tau, and perform
a ritual of banishing Malkuth. But here let him not leave the square to
circumambulate the circle, but use the formula and God-form of
Harpocrates.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him advance in turn to the squares Jesod, Hod, Netzach,
Tiphereth, Geburah, Chesed and banish each by appro- priate
rituals.</p></li>
<li><p>And let him know that such rituals include the pronuncia- tion of
the appropriate names of God backwards, and also a curse against the
Sephira in respect of ail that which it is, for that which distinguishes
and séparâtes it from Kether.</p></li>
<li><p>Advancing to the squares of Binah and Chokmah in turn, let him
banish these also. And for that by now an awe and trembling shall hâve
taken hold upon him, let him banish these by a suprême ritual of
inestimable puissance ; and let him beware exceedingly lest his will
falter or his courage fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, let him, advancing to the square of Kether, banish that
also by what means he may. At the end whereof let him set his foot upon
the light, extinguishing it 1 ; and, as he falleth, let him falJ within
the circle.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>SECOND METHOD</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let the Hermit be seated in his Asana, robed, and let him meditate
in turn upon every several part of his body until that part is so unreal
to him that he no longer includes it in his compréhension of himself.
For example if it be his right foot, let him touch that foot, and be
alarmed, thinking, “A foot!… foot! What is this foot? Surely I am not
alone in the Hermitage!”</li>
</ol>
<p>And this practice should be carried out not only at the time of
méditation, but during the day’s work.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>This méditation is to be assisted by reasoning- as, “This foot is
not I. If I should lose my foot, I should still be I. This foot is a

<p>_ 3 - This practice being perfect for each part of the body, let him
combine his workings until the whole body is thus ur.derstood as the
non-Ego and as illusion.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Let then the Hermit, seated in his Asana, meditate upon the
Muladhara Cakkra ana its correspondence as a power of the mind, and
destroy it in the same manner as aforesaid. Also by reasoning:</li>
</ol>
<p>This émotion (memory, imagination, intellect, will, as it may be) is
not I. This émotion is transient: I am immovable. This émotion is
passion. I am peace”, and so on.</p>
<p>Let the other Cakkras in their turn be thus destroyed, each one with
its mental or moral attribute.</p>
<p>5- In this let him be aided by his own psychological analysis, so
that no part of his conscious being be thus left undestroyed. And on his
thoroughness in this matter may turn his success.</p>

<li><p>Lastly, having drawn ail his being into the highest Sahasrara
Cakkra, let him remain eternally fixed in méditation thereupon.</p></li>

<p>THIRD METHOD.</p>
<p>i; Tet the Hermit stimulate each of the senses in turn, concen-
trating upon each until it ceases to stimulate.</p>
<p>(The senses of sight and touch are extremely difficult to conquer. In
the end the Hermit must be utterly unable by any effort to see or feel
the object of those senses, O. M.)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>This being perfected, let him combine them two at a time.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, let him chew ginger (taste and touch), and watch</p>
<p>a waterfall (sight and hearing) and watch incense (sight and smell)
and crush sugar in his teeth (taste and hearing) and so on.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>These twenty-five practices being accomplished, let him combine
them three at a time, then four at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, let him combine ail the senses in a single
object.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And herein may a sixth sense be included. He is then to with-</p>
<p>draw himself entirely from ail these stimulations, ferinde ac cadaver
, in spite of his own efforts to attach himself to them.</p>
<p>— 412 —</p>
<p>5 - By this method it is said that the démons of the Ruach, that is,
thoughts and memories, are inhibited, and We deny it not. But if so be
that they arise, let him build a wall between himself and them according
to the method.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Thus having stilled the voices of the Six, may he obtain in sense
the subtlety of the Seventh.</li>

<p>(We add the following, contributed by a friend at that time without
the A.-. A .’. and its dépendent orders. He worked out the method
himself, and we think it may prove useful to many. O. M.).</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The beginner must first practise breathing regularly through the
nose, at the same time trying hard to believe that the breath goes to
the Ajna and not to the lungs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pranayama exercises described in the Equinox Vol. i, No. 4,
p. ioi must next be practised, always with the idea that Ajna is
breathing.</p>
<p>Try to réalisé that power, not air, is being drawn into the Ajna, is
being concentrated there during Kumbhakam, and is vivifying the Ajna
during expiration. Try rather to increase the force of con¬ centration
in Ajna than to increase so excessively the length of Kumbhakam as this
is dangerous if rashly undertaken.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Walk slowly in a quiet place ; réalisé that the legs are moving, and
study their movements. Understand thoroughly that these movements are
due to nerve messages sent down from the brain, and that the controlling
power lies in the Ajna. The legs are automatic, like those of a wooden
monkey: the power in Ajna is that which does the work, is that which
walks. This is not hard to réalisé, and should be grasped firmly,
ignoring ail other walking sensations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apply this method to every other muscular movement.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Lie fiat on the back with the feet under a heavy piece of furniture.
Keeping the spine straight and the arms in a line with the body, rise
slowly to a sitting posture, by means of the force residing in the Ajna
(i.e. try to prevent the mind dwelling on any other exertion or
sensation.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Then let the body slowly down to its original position. Repeat</p>
<p>4i3</p>
<p>this two or three times, every night and morning, and slowly increase
the number of répétitions.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Try to transfer ail bodily sensations to the Ajna, e.g., “I am
cold” should mean “I feel cold”, or better still, “I am aware of a
sensation of cold” — transfer this to the Ajna, “the Ajna is aware”,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Pain if very slight may easily be transferred to the Ajna after a
little practice. The best method for a beginner is to imagine he has a
pain in the body and then imagine that it passes directly into the Ajna.
It does not pass through the intervening structures, but goes direct.
After continuai practice even severe pain may be transferred to the
Ajna.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix the mind on the base of the spine and then gradually move the
thoughts upwards to the Ajna.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(In this méditation Ajna is the Holy of Holies, but it is dark and
empty.)</p>
<p>Finally, strive hard to drive anger and other obsessing thoughts into
the Ajna. Try to develop a tendency to think hard of Ajna when these
thoughts attack the mind, and let Ajna conquer them.</p>
<p>Beware of thinking of a My Ajna”. In these méditations and practices,
Ajna does not belong to y ou; Ajna is the master and worker, you are the
wooden monkey.</p>

<p>ooo. May be.</p>
<p>(oo. It has not been possible to construct this book on a basis of
pure Scepticism. This matters less, as the practice leads to scepticism,
and it mav be through it.)</p>
<ol start="15" type="a">
<li>This book is not intended to lead to the suprême attainment. On the
contrary, its results define the separate being of the Exempt Adept from
the rest of the Universe, and discover his relation to the Universe.
1</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is of such importance to the Exempt Adept that We cannot
overrate it. Let him in no wise adventure the plunge into the Abyss
until he has accomplished this to his most perfect satisfaction.
2</p></li>
<li><p>For in the Abyss no effort is anywise possible. The Abyss is
passed by virtue of the mass of the Adept and his Karma. Two forces
impel him : (i) the attraction of Binah, (2) the impulse of his Karma ;
and the ease and even the safety of his passage dépend on the strength
and direction of the latter. 3</p></li>
<li><p>Should one rashly dare the passage, and take the irrevocable Oath
of the Abyss, he might be lost therein through Aeons of incalculable
agony; he might even be thrown back upon Chesed, with the terrible Karma
of failure added to his original imperfec¬ tion.</p></li>
<li><p>It is even said that in certain circumstances it is possible
to</p></li>
<li><p>This book tells how to enquire “Who am I?” “What is my relation
with nature ?”</p></li>
<li><p>One must destroy one’s false notions about who and what one is
before one can hnd the truth of the matter. One must therefore under-
stand those false notions before giving them up. Unless this be done
perfectly, one will get the True mixed up with the remains of the
False.</p></li>
<li><p>One’s life has hitherto been guided by those false notions.
There¬ fore on giving them up, one has no standard of control of thought
or action; and, until the truth is born, one can move only by virtue of
one’s momentum. It is jumping off.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>415 —</p>
<p>fall altogether from the Tree o£ Life and to attain the Towers of the
Black Brothers. But We hold that this is not possible for any adept who
has truly attained his grade, or even for any rrian who has really
sought to help humanity even for a single second x , and that although
his aspiration hâve been impure through vanity or any similar
imperfections.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Let then the Adept who finds the resuit of these méditations
unsatisfactory refuse the Oath of the Abyss, and live so that his Karma
gains strength and direction suitable to the task at some future period.
1 2</p></li>
<li><p>Memory is essential to the individual consciousness; other- wise
the mind were but a blank sheet on which shadows are cast. But we see
that not only does the mind retain impressions, but that it is so
constituted that its tendency is to retain some more excel- lently than
others. Thus the great classical scholar, Sir Richard Jebb, was unable
to learn even the schoolboy mathematics required for the preliminary
examination at Cambridge University, and a spécial Grâce of the
authorities was required in order to admit him.</p></li>
<li><p>The first method to be described has been detailed in Bhikkhu
Ananda Metteya’s a Training of the Mind” (Equinox 1,5, pp. 28-59, an d
especially pp. 48-57). We hâve little to alter or to add. Its most
important resuit as regards the Oath of the Abyss, is the freedom from
ail desire or clinging to anything which it gives, Its second resuit is
to aid the adept in the second method, by supplying him with further
data for his investigation. 3</p></li>
<li><p>The stimulation of memory useful in both practices is also
achieved by simple méditation (Liber E), in a certain stage of which old
memories arise unbidden. The adept may then practise this, stopping at
this stage, and encouraging instead of suppressing the flashes of
memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoroaster has said, “Explore the River of the Soûl,
whence</p></li>
<li><p>Those in possession of Liber CLXXXV will note that in every grade
but one the aspirant is pledged to serve his inferiors in the
Order.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the Adeptus Exemptus perfect as such before
proceeding.</p></li>
<li><p>The Magical Memory (i.e. of former incarnations) frees one from
desire by shewing how futile and sorrow-breeding ail earthly and even
sub- magical attainment prove.</p></li>

<p>or in what order you hâve corne ; so that although you hâve become a
servant to the body, you may again rise to that Order (the A.<em>.
A.</em>.) from which you descended, joining Works (Kamma) to the Sacred
Reason (the Tao)”.</p>
<p>io. The Resuit of the Second Method is to show the Adept to what end
his powers are destined. When he has passed the Abyss and becomes Nemo,
the return of the current causes him a to appear in the Heaven of
Jupiter as a morning star or as an evening star” 1 In other words he
should discover what may be the nature of his work. Thus Mohammed was a
Brother reflected into Netzach, Buddha a Brother reflected into Hod, or,
as some say, Daath. The présent manifestation of Frater P. to the outer
is in Tiphereth, to the inner in the path of Léo.</p>
<p>IL First Method. Let the Exempt Adept first train himself to think
backwards by external means, as set forth here following.—</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Let him learn to write backwards, with either hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him learn to walk backwards.</p></li>
<li><p>Let him constantly watch, if convenient, cinematograph</p></li>
</ol>
<p>films, and listen to phonograph records, reversed, and let him so
accustom himself to these that they appear natural and appréciable as a
whole.</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>Let him practise speaking backwards: thus for “I am</li>
</ol>
<p>He” let him say, “Eh ma I”.</p>
<ol start="5" type="a">
<li>Let him learn to read backwards. In this it is difficult to</li>
</ol>
<p>avoid cheating one’s self, as an expert reader sees a sentence at a
glance. Let his disciple read aloud to him backwards, slowly at first,
then more quickly.</p>
<ol start="6" type="a">
<li>Of his own ingenium, let him devise other methods.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>In this his brain will at first be overwhelmed by a sense of utter
confusion j secondly, it will endeavour to évadé the difficulty by a
trick. The brain will prétend to be workmg backwards when</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li>The formula of the Great Work “Solve et Coagula” may be thus
interpreted. Solve , the dissolution of the self in the Infinité;
Coagula , the présentation of the Infinité, in a concrète form, to the
outer. Both are necessary to the Task of a Master of the Temple. He may
appear in any other Heaven, according to his general nature, in his
magical mask of</li>
</ol>
<p>initiation.</p>
<p>— 4 L —</p>
<p>it is merely normal. It is difficult to describe the nature of the
trick, but it will be quite obvious to anyone who has done practices (a)
and (b) for a day or two. They become quite easy, and he will think that
he is making progress, an illusion which close analysis will dispel.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p>Having begun to train his brain in this manner and obtained some
little success, let the Exempt Adept, seated in his Asana, think first
of his présent attitude, next of the act of being seated, next of his
entering the room, next of his robing, etc. exactly as it happened. And
let him most strenuously endeavour to think each act as happening
backwards. It is not enough to think, “I am seated here, and before that
I was standing, and before that I entered the room”, etc. That sériés is
the trick detected in the preliminary practices. The sériés must not run
“ghi-def-abc” but “ihgfedcba”: not “horse a is this” but a esroh a si
siht”. To obtain this thoroughly well, practice (c) is very useful. The
brain will be found to struggle constantly to right itself, soon
accustoming itself to accept “esroh” as merely another glyph for
“horse”. This tendency must be constantly combated.</p></li>
<li><p>In the early stages of this practice, the endeavour should be to
meticulous minuteness of detail in remembering actions 3 for the brain’s
habit of thinking forward will at first be insuperable. Thinking of
large and complex actions, then, will give a sériés which we may
symbolically Write “opqrstu-hijklmn-abcdefg”. If these be split into
detail, we shall hâve “stu-pqr-o-mn-kl-hij-fg- cde-ab” which is much
nearer to the idéal “utsrqponmlkjihgfedcba”.</p></li>
<li><p>Capacities differ widely, but the Exempt Adept need hâve no
reason to be discouraged if after a month’s continuous labour he find
that now and again for a few seconds his brain really Works
backwards.</p></li>
<li><p>The Exempt Adept should concentrate his efforts upon obtaining a
perfect picture of five minutes backwards rather than upon extending the
time covered by his méditation. For this preliminary training of the
brain is the Pons Asinorum of the whole process.</p></li>
<li><p>This five minutes 5 exercise being satisfactory, the Exempt Adept
may extend the same at his discrétion to cover an hour, a</p></li>
</ol>
<p>— 418 —</p>
<p>day ; a week, and so on. Difficultés vanish before him as he
advancesj the extension from a day to the course of his whole life will
not prove so difficult as the perfecting of the five minutes.</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p>This practice should be repeated at least four times daily, and
progress is shown firstly by the ever easier running of the brain,
secondly by the added memories which arise.</p></li>
<li><p>It is useful to reflect during this practice, which in time
becomes almost mechanical, upon the way in which effects spring from
causes. This aids the mind to link its memories, and préparés the adept
for the preliminary practice of the second method.</p></li>
<li><p>Having allowed the mind to return for some hundred times to the
hour of birth, it should be encouraged to endeavour to penetrate beyond
that period. 1 If it be properly trained to run backwards, there will be
little difficulty in doing this, although it is one of the distinct
steps in the practice.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be then that the memory will persuade the adept of some
previous existence. Where this is possible, let it be checked by an
appeal to facts, as follows : -—</p></li>
<li><p>It often occurs to men that on visiting a place to which they
hâve never been, it appears familiar. This may arise from a confusion of
thought or a slipping of the memory, but it is con- ceivably a
fact.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If, then, the adept a remember î? that he was in a previous life in
some City, say Cracow, which he has in this life never visited, let him
describe from memory the appearance of Cracow, and of its inhabitants,
setting down their names. Let him further enter into details of the city
and its customs. And having done this with great minuteness, let him
confirm the same by consultation with historians and geographers, or by
a personal visit, remembering (both to the crédit of his memory and its
discrédit) that historians, geographers, and himself are alike fallible.
But let him not trust his memory, to assert its conclusions as fact, and
act thereupon, without most adéquate confirmation.</p>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li><ul>
<li>This process of checking his memory should be practised</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Freudian forgetfulness tries to shield one from the shock of death.
One has to brace oneself to face it in other ways, as by risking one’s
life habitually.</li>
</ol>
<p>419 —</p>
<p>with the earlier memories of childhood and youth by reference to the
memories and records of others, always reflecting upon the fallibility
even of such safeguards.</p>
<ol start="24" type="1">
<li><p>Ail this being perfected, so that the memory reaches back into
aeons incalculably distant, let the Exempt Adept meditate upon the
fruitlessness of ail those years, and upon the fruit thereof, severing
that which is transitory and worthless from that which is eternal. And
it may be that he being but an Exempt Adept may hold ali to be
savourless and full of sorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>This being so, without réluctance will he swear the Oath of the
Abyss.</p></li>
<li><p>Second Method. — Let the Exempt Adept, fortified by the practice
of the first method, enter the preliminary practice of the second
method.</p></li>
<li><p>Second Method. — Preliminary Practices. Let him, seated in his
Asana, consider any event, and trace it to its immédiate causes. And let
this be doue very fully and minutely. Here, for example, is a body erect
and motionless. Let the adept consider the many forces which maintain it
5 firstly, the attraction cf the earth, of the sun, of the planets, of
the farthest stars, nay of every mote of dust in the room, one cf which
(could it be annihilated) would cause that body to move, although so
imper- ceptibly. Also the résistance of the floor, the pressure of the
air, and ail other external conditions. Secondly, the internai forces
which sustain it, the vast and complex machinery of the skeleton, the
muscles, the blood, the lymph, the marrow, ail that makes up a man.
Thirdly the moral and intellectual forces involved, the mind, the will,
the consciousness. Let him continue this with unremitting ardour,
searching Nature, leaving nothing out.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, let him take one of the immédiate causes of his position,
and trace out its equilibrium. For example, the will. What détermines
the will to aid in holding the body erect and motionless ?</p></li>
<li><p>This being discovered, let him choose one of the forces which
determined his will, and trace out that in similar fashion; and let this
process be continued for many days until the inter- dependence of ail
things is a truth assimilated in his inmost being.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>420</p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li>This being accomplished, let him trace his own history with spécial
reference to the causes of each event. And in this practice he may
neglect to some extent the universal forces which at ail times act on
ail, as for example, the attraction of masses, and let him concentrate
his attention upon the principal and determining or effective
causes.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, he is seated, perhaps, in a country place in Spain. Why
? Because Spain is warm and suitable for méditation, and because cities
are noisy and crowded. Why is Spain warm ? and why does he wish to
meditate ? Why choose warm Spain rather than warm India? To the last
question: Because Spain is nearer to his home. Then why is his home near
Spain ? Because his parents were Germans. And why did they go to Germany
? And so during the whole méditation.</p>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li><p>On another day, let him begin with a question of another kind,
and every day devise new questions, not concerning his présent
situation, but also abstract questions. Thus let him connect the
prevalence of water upon the surface of the globe with its necessity to
such life as we know, with the spécifie gravity and other physical
properties of water, and let him perceive ultimately through ail this
the necessity and concord of things, not concord as the school- men of
old believed, making ail things for man’s benefit or convenience, but
the essential mechanical concord whose final law is inertie. And in
these méditations let him avoid as if it were the plague any
spéculations sentimental or fantastic.</p></li>
<li><p>Second Method. The Practice Proper. — Having then perfected in
his mind these conceptions, let him apply them to his own career,
forging the links of memory into the chain of necessity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And let this be his final question: To what purpose am I fitted ? Of
what service can my being prove to the Brothers of the A A .’. if I
cross the Abyss, and am admitted to the City of the Pyramids ?</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li>Now that he may clearly understand the nature of this question, and
the method of solution, let him study the reasoning of the anatomist who
reconstructs an animal from a single bone.</li>
</ol>
<p>To take a simple example. —</p>
<ol start="34" type="1">
<li>Suppose, having lived ail my life among savages, a ship is</li>
</ol>
<p>421</p>
<p>cast upon the shore and wrecked. Undamaged among the cargo is a
“Victoria”. What is its use ? The wheels speak of roads, their slimness
of smooth roads, the brake of hilly roads. The shafts show that it was
meant to be drawn by an animal, their height and length suggest an
animal of the size of a horse. That the carnage is open suggests a
climate tolerable at any time of the year. The height of the box
suggests crowded streets, or the spirited character of the animal
employed to draw it. The cushions indicate its use to convey men rather
than merchandise; its hood that rain some- j mes falls, or that the sun
is at times powerful. The springs would</p>
<p>imply considérable skill in metals; the varnish much attainment in
that craft.</p>
<p>35 * Similarly, let the adept consider of his own case. Now that he
is on the point of plunging into the Abyss a giant Why ? confronts him
with uplifted club.</p>
<p>3 b. There is no minutest atom of his composition which can be
withdrawn without making him some other than he is; no useless moment in
his past. Then what is his future ? The “Victoria” is not a wagon; it is
not intended for carting hay. It is not a sulky; it is useless in
trotting races.</p>
<p>3/* So the adept has military genius, or much knowledge of Greek; how
do these attainments help his purpose, or the purpose of the Brothers ?
He was put to death by Calvin, or stoned by Hezekiah; as a snake he was
killed by a villager, or as an éléphant slain in battle under Hamilcar.
How do such memories help him ? Until he hâve thoroughly mastered the
reason for every incident in his past, and found a purpose for every
item of his présent equipment, he cannot truly answer even those Three
Questions that were first put to him, even the Three Questions of the
Ritual of the Pyramid ; he is not ready to swear the Oath of the
Abyss.</p>
<ol start="38" type="1">
<li>But being thus enlightened, let him swear the Oath of the Abyss;
yea, le t him swear the Oath of the Abyss.</li>
</ol>
<p>I. A brother known to me was repeatedly baffled in this méditation.
But one day being thrown with his horse over a sheer cliff of forty
feet, and escaping without a scratch or a bruise, he was reminded of his
many narrow escapes from death. These proved to be the last factors in
his problem, which, thus completed, solved itself in a moment. (O. M.
