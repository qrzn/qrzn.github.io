<h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<p>In 1943 Aleister Crowley met a lady who, having heard of his wide
knowledge and experience, asked his advice on occult, spiritual, and
practical matters.<br />
This chance connection resulted in a stimulating exchange of letters.
Crowley then asked others to put similar questions to him. The result
was this collection of over eighty letters which are now being issued
over the title that he chose, “MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS.”<br />
Crowley did not keep copies of his early letters to the above-mentioned
lady, so was unable to include them in the collection that he planned to
publish. Fortunately they have been preserved and are now<br />
included in the introduction to this book. Their original form has been
retained with the opening and closing formulae which Crowley used in all
his letters.<br />
Crowley at first intended to call the book “ALEISTER EXPLAINS
EVERYTHING”, and sent the following circular to his friends and
disciples asking them to suggest subjects for inclusion.<br />
Aleister Explains Everything<br />
“Much gratified was the author of THE BOOK OF THOTH to have so many
letters of appreciation, mostly from women, thanking him for not
‘putting it in unintelligible language’, for ‘making it all so clear
that even I with my limited intelligence can understand it, or think I
do.’<br />
”Nevertheless and notwithstanding! For many years the Master Therion has
felt acutely the need of some groundwork teaching suited to those who
have only just begun the study of Magick and its subsidiary sciences, or
are merely curious about it, or interested in it with intent to study.
Always he has done his utmost to make his meaning clear to the average
intelligent educated person, but even<br />
those who understand him perfectly and are most sympathetic to his work,
agree that in this respect he has often failed. “So much for the
diagnosis—now for the remedy!”One genius, inspired of the gods,
suggested recently that the riddle might be solved somewhat on the old
and well-tried lines of ‘Dr Brewer’s Guide to Science’; i.e., by having
aspirants write to the Master asking questions, the kind of problem that
naturally comes into the mind of any sensible inquirer, and getting his
answer in the form of a letter. ‘What is it?’ ‘Why should I bother my
head about it?’ ‘What are its principles?’ ‘What use is it?’ ‘How do I
begin?’, and the like. “This plan has been put into action; the idea has
been to cover the subjects from every possible angle. The style has been
colloquial and fluent; technical terms have either been carefully
avoided or most carefully explained; and the letter has not been
admitted to the series until the querent has expressed satisfaction.
Some seventy letters, up to the present have been written, but still
there seem to be certain gaps in the demonstration, like those white
patches on the map of the World, which looked so tempting fifty years
ago.”This memorandum is to ask for your collaboration and support. A
list, indicating briefly the subject of each letter already written, is
appended. Should you think that any of those will help you in your own
problems, a typed copy will be sent to you at once … Should you want to
know anything outside the scope, send in your question (stated as fully
and clearly as possible) … The answer should reach you, bar accidents,
in less than a month … It is proposed ultimately to issue the series in
book form.” This has now been done.<br />

<p>Letters Written by the Master Therion to a Student<br />
Letter No. A<br />
March 19, 1943<br />
Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law<br />
I was very glad to gather from your conversation yesterday afternoon
that you have a serious intention of taking up the Great Work in the
proper spirit. Your criticisms of previous experience in the course of
your adventures appeared to be singularly sane and just. As I promised I
am writing this letter to cover a few practical points which we had not
time to discuss and which in any case I think it better to arrange by
correspondence.<br />
1) It is of the first importance that you should understand my personal
position. It is not actually wrong to regard me as a teacher, but it is
certainly liable to mislead; fellow-student, or, if you like,
fellow-sufferer, seems a more appropriate definition.<br />
The climax of my life was what is known as the Cairo Working, described
in the minutest detail in The Equinox of the Gods. At that time most of
The Book of the Law was completely unintelligible to me, and a good deal
of it—especially the third chapter—extremely antipathetic. I fought
against this book<br />
for years; but it proved irresistible.<br />
I do not think I am boasting unfairly when I say that my personal
researches have been of the greatest value and importance to the study
of the subject of Magick and Mysticism in general, especially my
integration of the various thought-systems of the world, notably the
identification of the system of the Yi King with that of the Qabalah.
But I do assure you that the whole of my life’s work, were it multiplied
a thousand fold, would not be worth one tithe of the value of a single
verse of The Book of the Law.<br />
I think you should have a copy of The Equinox of the Gods and make The
Book of the Law your constant study. Such value as my own work may
possess for you should amount to no more than an aid to the
interpretation of this book.<br />
2) It may be that later on you will want a copy of Eight Lectures on
Yoga so I am putting a copy aside for you in case you should want
it.<br />
3) With regard to the O.T.O., I believe I can find you a typescript of
all the official documents. If so, I will let you have them to read, and
you can make up your mind as to whether you wish to affiliate to the
Third Degree of the Order. I should consequently, in the case of your
deciding to affiliate, go with you though the script of the Rituals and
explain the meaning of the whole thing; communicating, in addition, the
real secret and significant knowledge of which ordinary Masonry is not
possessed.<br />
4) The horoscope; I do not like doing these at all, but it is part of
the agreement with the Grand Treasurer of the O.T.O. that I should
undertake them in worthy cases, if pressed. But I prefer to keep the
figure to myself for future reference, in case any significant event
makes consultation desirable.<br />
Now there is one really important matter. The only thing besides The
Book of the Law which is in the forefront of the battle. As I told you
yesterday, the first essential is the dedication of all that one is and
all that one has to the Great Work, without reservation of any sort.
This must be kept constantly in mind; the way to do this is to practice
Liber Resh vel Helios, sub figura CC, pp. 425-426 - Magick.<br />
There is another version of these Adorations, slightly fuller; but those
in the text are quite alright. [8] The important thing is not to forget.
I shall have to teach you the signs and gestures which go with the
words.</p>
<p>It is also desirable before beginning a formal meal to go through the
following dialogue: Knock 3-5-3: say, “Do what thou wilt shall be the
whole of the Law.” The person at the other end of the table replies:
“What is thy Will?” You: “It is my Will to eat and drink.” He: “To what
end?” You: “That my body may be fortified thereby.” He: “To what end?”
You: “That I may accomplish the Great Work.” He: “Love is the law, love
under will.” You, with a single knock: “Fall to.” When alone make a
monologue of it: thus, Knock 3-5-3. Do what, etc. It is my Will to,
etc., that my body, etc., that I may, etc., Love is, etc. Knock: and
begin to eat.</p>
<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of performing these
small ceremonies regularly, and being as nearly accurate as possible
with regard to the times. You must not mind stopping in the middle of a
crowded thoroughfare—lorries or no lorries—and saying the Adorations;
and you must not mind snubbing your guest—or your host—if he or she
should prove ignorant of his or her share of the dialogue. It is perhaps
because these matters are so petty and trivial in appearance that they
afford so excellent a training. They teach you concentration,
mindfulness, moral and social courage, and a host of other virtues. Like
a perfect lady, I have kept the tit bit to the last. It is absolutely
essential to begin a magical diary, and keep it up daily. You begin by
an account of your life, going back even before your birth to your
ancestry. In conformity with the practice which you may perhaps choose
to adopt later, given in Liber Thisarb, sub figura CMXIII, paragraphs
2728, Magick, pp. 420-422, you must find an answer to the question: “How
did I come to be in this place at this time, engaged in this particular
work?” As you will see from the book, this will start you on the
discovery of who you really are, and eventually lead you to your
recovering the memory of previous incarnations.<br />
As it is difficult for you to come to Town except at rare and irregular
intervals, may I suggest a plan which has previously proved very useful,
and that is a weekly letter. Eliphas Lévi did this with the Baron
Spedalieri, and the correspondence is one of the most interesting of his
works. You ask such questions as you wish to have answered, and I answer
them to the best of my ability. I, of course, add spontaneous remarks
which may be elicited by my observations on your progress and the
perusal of your magical diary. This, of course, should be written on one
side of the paper only, so that the opposite page is free for comments,
and an arrangement should be made for it to be inspected at regular
intervals.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,<br />

<h3 id="letter-no.-b">Letter No. B</h3>
<p>April 20, 1943<br />
Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</p>
<p>I was very glad to have your letter, and am very sorry to hear that
you have been in affliction. About the delay, however, I think I ought
to tell you that the original Rule of the Order of A.’. A.’. was that
the introducer read over a short lection to the applicant, then left him
alone for a quarter of an hour, and on coming back received a “yes” or
“no.” If there was any hesitation about it the applicant was barred for
life.</p>
<p>The reason for the relaxation of the rule was that it was thought
better to help people along in the early stages of the work, even if
there was no hope of their turning out first-class. But I should like
you to realize that sooner or later, whether in this incarnation or
another, it is put up to you to show [9] perfect courage in face of the
completely unknown, and the power of rapid and irrevocable decision
without counting the cost.<br />
I think that it is altogether wrong to allow yourself to be worried by
“psychological, moral, and artistic problems.” It is no good your
starting anything of any kind unless you can see clearly into the
simplicity of truth. All this humming and hawing about things is moral
poison. What is the use of being a woman if you have not got an
intuition, an instinct enabling you to distinguish between the genuine
and the sham?<br />
Your state of mind suggests to me that you must have been, in the past,
under the influence of people who were always talking about things, and
never doing any real work. They kept on arguing all sorts of obscure
philosophical points; that is all very well, but when you have succeeded
in analysing your reactions you will understand that all this talk is
just an excuse for not doing any serious work.<br />
I am confirmed in this judgment by your saying: “I don’t know if I want
to enter into a great conflict. I need peace.” Fortunately you save
yourself by adding: “Real peace that is living and not stagnant.”<br />
All life is conflict. Every breath that you draw represents a victory in
the struggle of the whole Universe. You can’t have peace without perfect
mastery of circumstance; and I take it that this is what you mean by
“living, not stagnant.” But it is of the first consequence for you to
summon up the resolution to stamp on this sea of swirling thoughts by an
act of will; you must say: “Peace be still.” The moment you have
understood these thoughts for what they are, tools of the enemy,
invented by him with the idea of preventing you from undertaking the
Great Work—the moment you dismiss all such considerations firmly and
decisively, and say: “What must I do?” and having discovered that, set
to work to do it, allowing of no interruption, you will find that living
peace which (as you seem to see) is a dynamic and not a static
condition. (There is quite a lot about this point in Little Essays
Toward Truth, and also in The Vision and the Voice.)</p>
<p>Your postscript made me smile. It is not a very good advertisement
for the kind of people with whom you have been associated in the past.
My own position is a very simple one. I obeyed the injunction to “buy a
perfectly black hen, without haggling.” I have spent over 100,000 pounds
of my inherited money on this work: and if I had a thousand times that
amount today it would all go in the same direction. It is only when one
is built in this way, to stand entirely aloof from all considerations of
twopence halfpenny more or fourpence halfpenny less, that one obtains
perfect freedom on this Plane of Discs.<br />
All the serious Orders of the world, or nearly all, begin by insisting
that the aspirant should take a vow of poverty; a Buddhist Bhikku, for
example, can own only nine objects —his three robes, begging bowl, a
fan, toothbrush, and so on. The Hindu and Mohammedan Orders have similar
regulations; and so do all the important Orders of monkhood in
Christianity.<br />
Our own Order is the only exception of importance; and the reason for
this is that it is much more difficult to retain one’s purity if one is
living in the world than if one simply cuts oneself off from it. It is
far easier to achieve technical attainments if one is unhampered by any
such considerations. These regulations operate as restrictions to one’s
usefulness in helping the world. There are terrible dangers, the worst
dangers of all, associated with complete retirement. In my own personal
judgment, moreover, I think that our own ideal of a natural life is much
more wholesome.<br />
When you have found out a little about your past incarnations, you
should be able to understand this very clearly and simply.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,<br />
666</p>
<h3 id="letter-no.-c">Letter No. C</h3>
<p>April 30, 1943<br />
Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</p>
<p>Thank you for your long letter of no date, but received two days ago.
I am very sorry you are still feeling exhausted. I am not too good
myself, for I find this weather very trying. I will answer your various
points as best I can. I am arranging to send you the official papers
connected with the O.T.O., but the idea that you should meet other
members first is quite impossible. Even after affiliation, you would not
meet anyone unless it were necessary for you to work in cooperation with
them. I am afraid you have still got the idea that the Great Work is a
tea-party. Contact with other students only means that you criticise
their hats, and then their morals; and I am not going to encourage
this.<br />
Your work is not anybody else’s; and undirected chatter is the worst
poisonous element in human society.<br />
When you talk of the “actual record” of the “Being called Jesus Christ,”
I don’t know what you mean.<br />
I am not aware of the existence of any such record. I know a great many
legends, mostly borrowed from previous legends of a similar
character.<br />
It would be better for you to get a copy of The Equinox of the Gods and
study it. The Great Work is the uniting of opposites. It may mean the
uniting of the soul with God, of the microcosm with the macrocosm, of
the female with the male, of the ego with the non-ego—or what not. By
“love under will” one refers to the fact that the method in every case
is love, by which is meant the uniting of opposites as above stated,
such as hydrogen and chlorine, sodium and oxygen, and so on.<br />
Any reaction whatever, any phenomenon, is a phenomenon of “love”, as you
will understand when I come to explain to you the meaning of the word
“Point-Event”. But love has to be “under will,” if it is to be properly
directed. You must find your True Will, and make all your actions
subservient to the one great purpose.<br />
Ra-Hoor is the Sun God; Tahuti is the Egyptian Mercury; Kephra is the
Sun at midnight.<br />
About your problems; what I have to do is to try to teach you to think
clearly. You will be immensely stimulated by having all the useless
trimmings stripped from your thinking apparatus. For instance, I don’t
think you know the first principles of logic. You apparently take up a
more or less Christian attitude, but at the same time you like very much
the idea of Karma. You cannot have both.<br />
The question about money does not arise. This old and very good rule
(which I have always kept) was really pertinent to the time when there
were actual secrets. But I have published openly all the secrets. All I
can do is to train you in a perfectly exoteric way. My suggestion about
the weekly letter was intended to exclude this question, as you would be
getting full commercial value for anything paid.<br />
Your questions about the Spirit of the Sun, and so on, are to be
answered by experience. Intellectual satisfaction is worthless. I have
to bring you to a state of mind completely superior to the mechanism of
the normal mind.<br />
A good deal of your letter is rather difficult to answer. You always
seem to want to put the cart before the horse. Don’t you see that, if I
were trying to get you to do something or other, I should simply return
you to the kind of answer which I thought would satisfy you, and make
you happy? And this would be very easy to do because you have got no
clear ideas about anything. For one thing, you keep on using terms about
whose significance we are not yet in agreement. When you talk<br />
about the “Christian path,” do you believe in vicarious atonement and
eternal damnation—or don’t you? A great deal of the confusion that
arises in all these questions, and grows constantly worse as
fellow-students talk them over—the blind leading the blind—is because
they have no idea of the necessity of defining their terms.<br />
Then again, you ask me questions like “What is purity?” that can be
answered in a dozen different ways; and you must understand what is
meant by a “universe of discourse.” If you asked me—“Is this sample of
chloride of gold a pure sample?” I can answer you. You must understand
the value of precision in speech. I could go on rambling about purity
and selflessness for years, and no one would<br />
be a penny the better.<br />
P.S.—or rather, I did not want to dictate this bit—Your ideas about the
O.T.O. remind me of some women’s idea of shopping. You want to maul
about the stock and then walk out with a proud glad smile: NO. Do you
really think that I should muster all the most distinguished people
alive for your inspection and approval?<br />
The affiliation clause in our Constitution is a privilege: a courtesy to
a sympathetic body. Were you not a Mason, or Co-Mason, you would have to
be proposed and seconded, and then examined by savage Inquisitors; and
then—probably—thrown out on to the garbage heap. Well, no, it’s not as
bad as that; but we certainly don’t want anybody who chooses to apply.
Would you do it yourself, if you were on the Committee of a Club? The
O.T.O. is a serious body, engaged on a work of Cosmic scope.<br />
You should question yourself: what can I contribute?<br />
Secrets. There is one exception to what I have said about publishing
everything: that is, the ultimate secret of the O.T.O. This is really
too dangerous to disclose; but the safeguard is that you could not use
it if you knew it, unless you were an advanced Adept; and you would not
be allowed to go so far unless we were satisfied that you were sincerely
devoted to the Great Work. (See One Star in Sight).<br />
True, the Black Brothers could use it; but they would only destroy
themselves.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,<br />
666</p>
<h3 id="letter-no.-d">Letter No. D</h3>
<p>June 8, 1943<br />
Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</p>
<p>Thanks for your letter. I couldn’t find the O.T.O. typescript—and
then it struck me that it would be useful to await your reactions. If I
were expecting some presumably important papers by post, I should get
anxious after 24 hours delay (at most) and start enquiries. Anyhow, I
can’t find them for the moment; but Mr Bryant said he would lend you his
Blue Equinox: pages 195-270 give what you<br />
require.<br />
But the real point of your affiliating is that it saves me from
constantly being on my guard lest I should mention something which I am
sworn not to reveal. As in every serious society, members are pledged
not to disclose what they may have learnt, whom they have met; it is so,
even in CoMasonry: isn’t it: But one may mention the names of members
who have died. (See Liber LII, par. 2.)<br />
Be happy then; the late X… Y… was one of us. I hope that he and Rudolph
Steiner will (between them) satisfy your doubts.<br />
The A.’.A.’. is totally different. One Star in Sight tells you
everything that you need to know.<br />
(Perhaps some of these regulations are hard to grasp: personally, I can
never understand all this ByLaw stuff. So you must ask me what, and why,
and so on.)<br />
There is really only one point for your judgment. “By their fruits ye
shall know them.” You have read Liber LXV and Liber VII; That shows you
what states you can attain by this curriculum. Now read “A Master of the
Temple” (Blue Equinox, pp. 127-170) for an account of the early stages
of training, and their results. (Of course, your path might not coincide
with, or even resemble, his path.)<br />
But do get it into you head that “If the blind lead the blind, they
shall both fall into the ditch.” If you had seen 1% of the mischief that
I have seen, you would freeze to the marrow of your bones at the mere
idea of seeing another member through the telescope! Well, I employ the
figure of hyperbole, that I admit; but it really won’t do to have a
dozen cooks at the broth! If you’re working with me, you’ll have no time
to waste on other people.<br />
I fear your “Christianity” is like that of most other folk. You pick out
one or two of the figures from which the Alexandrines concocted “Jesus”
(too many cooks, again, with a vengeance!) and neglect the others. The
Zionist Christ of Matthew can have no value for you; nor can the Asiatic
“DyingGod”—compiled from Melcarth, Mithras, Adonis, Bacchus, Osiris,
Attis, Krishna, and others—who supplied the miraculous and ritualistic
elements of the fable.<br />
Rightly you ask: “What can I contribute?” Answer: One Book. That is the
idea of the weekly letter: 52 of yours and 52 of mine, competently
edited, would make a most useful volume. This would be your property: so
that you get full material value, perhaps much more, for your outlay. I
thought of the plan because one such arrangement has recently come to an
end, with amazingly happy results:<br />
they should lie open to your admiring gaze in a few months from now.
Incidentally, I personally get nothing out of it; secretarial work costs
money these days. But there is another great advantage; it keeps both of
us up to the mark. Also, in such letters a great deal of odds and ends
of knowledge turn up automatically; valuable stuff, frequent enough;
yes, but one doesn’t want to lose the thread, once one starts. Possibly
ten days might be best.<br />
But please understand that this suggestion arose solely from your own
statement of what you thought would help in your present circumstances.
Anyway, as you say, decide! If it is yes, I should like to see you
before June 15 when I expect to go away for a few days; better to give
you some roundwork to keep you busy in my absence.</p>

<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</p>
<p>Much thought has gone into the construction of your Motto. “I will
become” can be turned neatly enough as “Let there be;” by avoiding the
First Pronoun one gets the idea of “the absorption of the Self in the
Beloved,” which is exactly what you want.<br />
“The creative Force of the Universe” is quite ready-made. …aµ.., a
pyramid, is that Force in its geometrical form; in its biological form
it is Fa…., the Yang or Lingam. Both words have the same numerical
value, 831. These two words can therefore serve you as the secret object
of your Work.<br />
How than can you construct the number 831?<br />
The Letter Kaph, Jupiter (Jehovah), the Wheel of Fortune in the
Tarot—the Atu X is a picture of the Universe built up and revolving by
virtue of those Three Principles: Sulphur, Mercury, Salt; or Gunas:
Sattvas, Rajas, Tamas—has the value 20. So also has the letter Yod spelt
in full.<br />
One Gnostic secret way of spelling and pronouncing Jehovah is ..O and
this has the value 811. So has “Let there be,” Fiat, transliterating
into Greek.</p>
<p>Resuming all these ideas, it seems that you can express your
aspiration very neatly, very fully, by choosing for your motto the words
FIAT YOD.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. Please study this letter, and these explanatory figures and
meditate upon them until you have fully assimilate not only the matter
under immediate consideration, but the general method of Qabalistic
research and construction. Note how new cognate ideas arise to enrich
the formula.</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>Note: In the “explanatory figures” referred to (omitted in the
printed edition) Crowley spelt out the various Greek and Hebrew words
mentioned with the numbers by each letter to indicate how they added to
these values. Where this edition, following the printed version, gives
the names of Hebrew letters in English transliteration, the original had
the actual Hebrew letters.</p>
<h3 id="letter-no.-f">Letter No. F</h3>
<p>Aug. 20, 1943</p>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law<br />
Let me begin by referring to my letter about the motto and make clear to
you the working of this letter.<br />
In this motto you have really got several ideas combined, and yet they
are really, of course, one idea.<br />
Fiat, being 811, is identical with IAO, and therefore FIAT YOD might be
read not only as “let there be” (or “Let me become”), the secret source
of all creative energy, but as “the secret source of the energy of
Jehovah.” The two words together, having the value of 831, they contain
the secret meanings Pyramis and Phallos, which is the same idea in
different forms; thus you have three ways of expressing the creative
form, in its geometrical aspect, its human aspect, and its divine
aspect. I am making a point of this, because the working out of this
motto should give you a very clear idea of the sort of way in which
Qabalah should be used. I think it is rather useful to remember what the
essence of the Qabalah is in principle; thus, in your correspondence for
Malkuth, Yesod, and Hod you are simply writing down some of the ideas
which pertain to the numbers 10, 9, and 8 respectively.<br />
Naturally, there is a great deal of redundancy and overloading as soon
as you get to ideas important enough to be comprehensive; as is
mentioned in the article on the Qabalah in Equinox Vol. I, No. 5, it is
quite easy to prove 1 = 2 = 3 = 4, etc.<br />
On the other hand, you must be careful to avoid taking the
correspondences given in the books of reference without thinking out why
they are so given. Thus, you find a camel in the number which refers to
the Moon, but the Tarot card “the Moon” refers not to the letter Gimel
which means camel, but to the letter Qoph, and the sign Pisces which
means fish, while the letter itself refers to the back of the head; and
you also find fish has the meaning of the letter Nun. You must not go on
from this, and say that the back of your head is like a camel—the
connection between them is simply that they all refer to the same
thing.<br />
In studying the Qabalah you mention six months; I think after that time
you should be able to realise that, after six incarnations of
uninterrupted study, you may realise that you can never know it; as
Confucius said about the Yi King. “If a few more years were added to my
life, I would devote a hundred of them to the study of the Yi.”<br />
If, however, you work at the Qabalah in the same way as I did myself, in
season and out of season, you ought to get a very fair grasp of it in
six months. I will now tell you what this method is: as I walked about,
I made a point of attributing everything I saw to its appropriate idea.
I would walk out of the door of my house and reflect that door is
Daleth, and house Beth; now the word “dob” is Hebrew for bear, and has
the number 6, which refers to the Sun. Then you come to the fence of
your property and that is Cheth—number 8, number of Tarot Trump 7, which
is the Chariot: so you begin to look about for your car. Then you come
to the street and the first house you see is number 86, and that is
Elohim, and it is built of red brick which reminds you of Mars and the
Blasted Tower, and<br />
so on. As soon as this sort of work, which can be done in a quite
light-hearted spirit, becomes habitual, you will find your mind running
naturally in this direction, and will be surprised at your progress.
Never let your mind wander from the fact that your Qabalah is not my
Qabalah; a good many of the things which I have noted may be useful to
you, but you must construct your own<br />
system so that it is a living weapon in your hand.<br />
I think I am fair if I say that the first step on the Qabalah which may
be called success, is when you make an actual discovery which throws
light on some problem which has been troubling you. A quarter of a
century ago I was in New Orleans, and was very puzzled about my
immediate course of action; in fact I may say I was very much
distressed. There seemed literally nothing that I could do, so I
bethought myself that I had better invoke Mercury. As soon as I got into
the appropriate frame of mind, it naturally occurred to me, with a sort
of joy, “But I am Mercury.” I put it into Latin— Mercurius sum, and
suddenly something struck me, a sort of nameless reaction which said:
“That’s not quite right.” Like a flash it came to me to put it into
Greek, which gave me “’..µ.. ..µ.” and adding that up rapidly, I got the
number 418, with all the marvellous correspondences which had been so
abundantly useful to me in the past (See Equ. of the Gods, p. 138). My
troubles disappeared like a flash of lightning.<br />
Now to answer your questions seriatum; it is quite all right to put
questions to me about The Book of the Law; a very extended commentary
has been written, but it is not yet published. I shall probably be able
to answer any of your questions from the manuscript, but you cannot go
on after that when it would become a discussion; as they say in the
law-courts, “You must take the witness’ answer.”<br />
II. The Qabalah, both Greek and Hebrew, also very likely Arabic, was
used by the author of The Book of the Law. I have explained above the
proper use of the Qabalah. I cannot tell you how the early Rosicrucians
used it, but I think one may assume that their methods were not
dissimilar to our own.<br />
Incidentally, it is not very safe to talk about Rosicrucians, because
their name has become a signal for letting loose the most devastating
floods of nonsense. What is really known about the original Rosicrucians
is practically confined to the three documents which they issued. The
eighteenth century Rosicrucians may, or may not, have been legitimate
successors of the original brotherhood—I don’t know. But from them the
O.T.O. derived its authority; The late O.H.O. Theodor Reuss possessed a
certain number of documents which demonstrated the validity of his claim
according to him; but I only saw two or three of them, and they were not
of very great importance. Unfortunately he died shortly after the last
War, and he had got out of touch with some of the other Grand Masters.
The documents did not come to me as they should have done; they were
seized by his wife who had an idea that she could sell them for a
fantastic price; and we did not feel inclined to meet her views. I don’t
think the matter is of very great importance, the work being done by
members of the Order all over the place is to me quite sufficient.<br />
III. The Ruach contains both the moral and intellectual worlds, which is
really all that we mean by the conscious mind; perhaps it even includes
certain portions of the subconscious.<br />
IV. In initiation from the grade of Neophyte to that of Zelator, one
passes by this way. The main work is to obtain admission to, and control
of, the astral plane. Your expressions about “purifying the feelings”
and so on are rather vague to enter into a scientific system like ours.
The result which you doubtless refer to is attained automatically in the
course of your experiments. You very soon discover the sort of state of
mind which is favourable or unfavourable to the work, and you also
discover what is helpful and harmful to these states in your way of
life. For instance, the practice like the nonreceiving of gifts is all
right for a Hindu whose mind is branded for ten thousand incarnations by
the<br />
shock of accepting a cigarette or a cup of tea. Incidentally, most of
the Eastern cults fall down when they come West, simply because they
make no allowance for our different temperaments. Also they set tasks
which are completely unsuitable to Europeans—an immense amount of
disappointment has been caused by failure to recognise these
facts.<br />
Your sub-questions a, b, and c are really answered by the above. All the
terms you use are very indefinite. I hope it will not take too long to
get you out of the way of thinking in these terms. For instance, the
word “initiation” includes the whole process, and how to distinguish
between it and enlightenment I cannot tell you. “Probation,” moreover,
if it means “proving,” continues throughout the entire process. Nothing
is worse for the student than to indulge in these wild speculations
about ambiguous terms.<br />
V. You can, if you like, try to work out a progress of Osiris through
Amennti on the Tree of Life, but I doubt whether you will get any
satisfactory result. It seems to me that you should confine yourself
very closely to the actual work in front of you. At the present moment,
of course, this includes a good deal of general study; but my point is
that the terms employed in that study should always be capable of
precise definition. I am not sure whether you have my Little Essays
Toward Truth. The first essay in the book entitled “Man” gives a full
account of the five principles which go to make up Man according to the
Qabalistic system. I have tried to define these terms as accurately as
possible, and I think you will find them, in any case, clearer than
those to which you have become accustomed with the Eastern systems. In
India, by the way, no attempt is ever made to use these vague terms.
They always have a very clear idea of what is meant by words like
“Buddhi,” “Manas” and the like.<br />
Attempts at translation are very unsatisfactory. I find that even with
such a simple matter as the “Eight limbs of Yoga,” as you will see when
you come to read my Eight Lectures.<br />
I am very pleased with your illustrations; that is excellent practice
for you. Presently you have to make talismans, and a Lamen for yourself,
and even to devise a seal to serve as what you might call a magical
coat-of-arms, and all this sort of thing is very helpful.<br />
It occurs to me that so far we have done nothing about the astral plane
and this path of Tau of which you speak. Have you had any experience of
travelling in the astral? If not, do you think that you can begin by
yourself on the lines laid down in Liber O, sections 5and 6? (See
Magick, pp. 387-9). If not you had better let me take you through the
first gates. The question of noise instantly arises; I think we should
have to do it not earlier than nine o’clock at night, and I don’t know
whether you can manage this.<br />

Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law<br />
“shall be” (instead of “Do what thou wilt is …”) not “is.” See Liber AL,
I, 36, 54, and II, 54. Not “Master Perdurabo”: see Magick p. XXIX. “Care
Frater” is enough. 777 is practically unpurchaseable: copies fetch £10
or so. Nearly all important correspondences are in Magick Table I. The
other 2 books are being sent at once. “Working out games with numbers.”
I am sorry you should see no more than this. When you are better
equipped, you will see that the Qabalah is the best (and almost the
only) means by which an intelligence can identify himself. And Gematria
methods serve to discover spiritual truths. Numbers are the network of
the structure of the Universe, and their relations the form of
expression of our Understanding of it. In Greek and Hebrew there is no
other way of writing numbers; our 1, 2, 3 etc. comes from the
Phoenicians through the Arabs. You need no more of Greek and Hebrew than
these values, some sacred words—knowledge grows by use—and books of
reference.<br />
One cannot set a pupil definite tasks beyond the groundwork I am giving
you, and we should find this correspondence taking clear shape of its
own accord. You have really more than you can do already. And I can only
tell you what the right tasks—out of hundreds—are by your own reactions
to your own study and practice. “Osiris in Amennti”—see the Book of the
Dead. I meant you might try to trace a parallelism between his
journeyings and the Path of Initiation.<br />
Astral travel—development of the Astral Body is essential to research;
and, above all, to he attainment of “the Knowledge and Conversation of
the Holy Guardian Angel.”<br />
You ought to demonstrate your performance of the Pentagram Ritual to me;
you are probably making any number of mistakes. I will, of course, take
you carefully through the O.T.O. rituals to III° as soon as you are
fairly familiar with them. The plan of the grades is this:—<br />
O – Attraction to the Solar System<br />
I – Birth<br />
II – Life<br />
III – Death<br />
IV – Exaltation<br />
P.I. -Annihilation<br />
V – Progressive comment on II with very special reference to<br />
IX – the central secret to practical magick<br />
There is thus no connection with the A.’.A.’. system and the Tree of
Life. Of course, there are certain analogies.<br />
Your suggested method of study: you have got my idea quite well. But
nobody can “take you through” the Grades of A.’.A.’.. The Grades confirm
your attainments as you make them; then, the new tasks appear. See One
Star in Sight.<br />

<p>November 10–11. 11 p.m.–2 a.m.<br />
Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law<br />
Yours of yestere’en came to gladden me just when the whole evening lay
blank before me: the one job such a big job that I simply can’t get down
to it until I get help: How annoying! Still, yours the gain!<br />
1. That verse (AL. I 44) condenses the whole magical technique. It makes
clear when you have understood it—the secret of success in the Great
Work. Of course at first it appears a paradox. You must have an aim, and
one aim only: yet on no account must you want to achieve it!!!<br />
Those chapters of The Book of Lies quoted in my last letter do throw
some light onto this Abyss of self-contradiction; and there is meaning
much deeper than the contrast between the Will with a capital W, and
desire, want, or velleity. The main point seems to be that in aspiring
to Power one is limited by the True Will. If you use force, violating
your own nature either from lack of understanding or from petulant whim,
one is merely wasting energy; things go back to normal as soon as the
stress is removed. This is one small case of the big Equation “Free Will
= Necessity” (Fate, Destiny, or Karma: it’s all much the same idea). One
is most rigidly bound by the causal chain that has dragged one to where
one is; but it is one’s own self that has forged the links.<br />
Please refrain from the obvious retort: “Then, in the long run, you
can’t possibly go wrong: so it doesn’t matter what you do.” Perfectly
true, of course! (There is no single grain of dust that shall not attain
to Buddhahood:” with some such words did the debauched old reprobate
seek to console himself when Time began to take its revenge.) But the
answer is simple enough: you happen to be the kind of being that thinks
it does matter what course you steer; or, still more haughtily, you
enjoy the pleasure of sailing.<br />
No, there is this factor in all success: self-confidence. If we analyse
this, we find that it means that one is aware that all one’s mental and
physical faculties are working harmoniously. The deadliest and subtlest
enemy of that feeling is anxiety about the result; the finest gauze of
doubt is enough to dim one’s vision, to throw the entire field out of
focus. Hence, even to be aware that there is a result in prospect must
militate against that serenity of spirit which is the essence of
self-confidence. As you will know, all our automatic physiological
functions are deranged if one is aware of This then, is the difficulty,
to enjoy consciously while not disturbing the process involved. The
obvious physical case is the sexual act: perhaps its chief importance is
just that it is a type of this exceptional spiritual-mental condition. I
hope, however, that you will remember what I have said on the subject in
paragraphs 15–17 of my 3rd Lecture on Yoga for Yellowbellies
(pp. 71-72); there is a way of obtaining ecstasy from the most
insignificant physiological function. Observe that in transferring the
whole consciousness to (say) one’s little finger or big toe is not
trying to interfere with the normal exercise of its activities, but only
to realize what is going on in the organism, the exquisite pleasure of a
function in its normal activity. With a little imagination one can
conceive the analogical case of the Universe itself; and, still less
fettered by even the mildest limitation which material symbols
necessarily (however little) suggest, “Remember all ye that existence is
pure joy; …” (AL II,9).<br />
Is it too bold to suggest that the gradual merging of all these Ways
into an interwoven unity may be taken as one mode of presentation of the
Accomplishment of the Great Work itself?<br />
At least, I feel fairly satisfied the meditation of them severally and
jointly may help you to an answer to your first question.<br />
2. Most people in my experience either cook up a hell-broth of
self-induced obstacles to success in Astral traveling, or else shoot
forth on the wings of romantic imagination and fool themselves for the
rest of their lives in the manner of the Village Idiot. Yours, luckily,
is the former trouble. But—is it plain obstinacy?—you do not exercise
the sublime Art of Guru-bullying. You should have made one frenzied leap
to my dying bed, thrust aside the cohorts of Mourning Archimandrites,
and wrung my nose until I made you do it.<br />
And you repeatedly insist that it is difficult. It isn’t. Is there,
however, some deep-seated inhibition—a (Freudian) fear of success? Is
there some connection with that sense of guilt which is born in all but
the very few?<br />
But you don’t give it a fair chance. There is, I admit, some trick, or
knack, about getting properly across; a faculty which one acquires (as a
rule) quite suddenly and unexpectedly. Rather like mastering some shots
at billiards. Practice has taught me how to communicate this to
students; only in rare cases does one fail. (It’s incredible: one man
simply could not be persuaded that intense physical exertion was the
wrong way to it.<br />
There he sat, with the veins on his forehead almost on the point of
bursting, and the arms of my favourite chair visibly trembling beneath
his powerful grip!) In your case, I notice that you have got this
practice mixed up with Dharana: you write of “Emptying my mind of
everything except the one idea, etc.” Then you go on: “The invoking of a
super-sensible Being is impossible to me as yet.” The impudence! The
arrogance! How do you know, pray madam? (Dial numbers at random: the
results are often surprisingly delightful!)<br />
Besides, I didn’t ask you to invoke a super-sensible (what a word!
Meaning?) Being right away, or at any time: that super-sensible is
getting on my nerves: do you mean “not in normal circumstances to be
apprehended by the senses?” I suppose so.<br />
In a word: do fix a convenient season for going on the Astral Plane
under my eye: half an hour (with a bit of luck) on not more than four
evenings would put you in a very different frame of mind. You will soon
“feel your feet” and then “get your sea-legs” and then, much sooner than
you think “Afloat in the Aethyr, O my God! my God!” . . . . . “White
swan, bear thou ever me up between thy wings!”<br />
3. Now then to your old Pons Asinorum about the names of the Gods! Stand
in the corner for half an hour with your face to the wall! Stay in after
school and write Malka be Tharshishim v-Ruachoth bSchehalim 999
times!<br />
My dear, dear, dear sister, a name is a formula of power. How can you
talk of “anachronism” when the Being is eternal? For the type of energy
is eternal.<br />
Every name is a number: and “Every number is infinite; there is no
difference.” (AL I, 4). But one Name, or system of Names, may be more
convenient either (a) to you personally or (b) to the work you are at.
E.g. I have very little sympathy with Jewish Theology or ritual; but the
Qabalah is so handy and congenial that I use it more than almost any—or
all the others together—for daily use and work. The Egyptian Theogony is
the noblest, the most truly magical, the most bound to me (or rather I
to it) by some inmost instinct, and by the memory of my incarnation as
Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, that I use it (with its Græco-Phoenician child) for all
work of supreme import. Why stamp my vitals, madam!<br />
The Abramelin Operation itself turned into this form before I could so
much as set to work on it! Like the Duchess’ baby (excuse this
enthusiasm; but you have aroused the British Lion-Serpent.)<br />
Note, please, that the equivalents given in 777 are not always exact.
Tahuti is not quite Thoth, still less Hermes; Mercury is a very much
more comprehensive idea, but not nearly so exalted: Hanuman hardly at
all. Nor is Tetragrammaton IAO, though even etymology asserts the
identity.<br />
In these matters you must be catholic, eclectic, even syncretic. And you
must consider the nature of your work. If I wanted to evoke
Taphthartharath, there would be little help indeed from any but the
Qabalistic system; for that spirit’s precise forms and numbers are not
to be found in any other.<br />
The converse, however, is not so true. The Qabalah, properly understood,
properly treated, is so universal that one can vamp up a ritual to suit
almost “any name and form.” But in such a case one may expect to have to
reinforce it by a certain amount of historical, literary, or philosophic
study—and research.<br />
4. Quite right, dear lady, about your incarnation memories acting as a
“Guide to the Way Back.” Of course, if you “missed an Egyptian
Incarnation,” you would not be so likely to be a little Martha, worried
“about much serving.” Don’t get surfeited with knowledge, above all
things; it is so very fascinating, so dreadfully easy; and the danger of
becoming a pedant—“Deuce take all your pedants! say I.” Don’t “dry-rot
at ease ’till the Judgment Day.”<br />
No, I will NOT recommend a book. It should not hurt you too much to
browse on condensed hay (or thistles) such as articles in
Encyclopaedias. Take Roget’s Thesaurus or Smith’s Smaller Classical
Dictionary (and the like) to read yourself to sleep on. But don’t
stultify yourself by taking up such study too seriously. You only make
yourself ridiculous by trying to do at 50 what you ought to have<br />
done at 15. As you didn’t—tant pis! You can’t possibly get the spirit;
if you could, it would mean merely mental indigestion. We have all read
how Cato started to learn Greek at 90: but the story stops there. We
have never been told what good it did to himself or anyone else.<br />
5. God-forms. See Magick pp. 378-9. Quite clear: quite adequate: no use
at all without continual practice. No one can join with you — off you go
again! No, no, a thousand times no: this is the practice par excellence
where you have to do it all yourself. The Vibration of God-names: that
perhaps, I can at least test you in. But don’t you dare come up for a
test until you’ve been at it—and<br />
hard—for at least 100 exercises.<br />
I think this is your trouble about being “left in the air.” When I
“present many new things” to you, the sting is in the tail—the practice
that vitalises it. Doctrinal stuff is fine “Lazily, lazily, drowsily,
drowsily, in the noo-on-dye shaun!” An ounce of your practice is worth a
ton of my teaching. GET THAT. It’s all your hatred of hard work:<br />
“Go to the ant thou sluggard!<br />
Consider her ways and be——.”<br />
I am sure that Solomon was too good a poet, and too experienced a Guru,
to tail off with the anticlimax “wise.”<br />
6. Minerval. What is the matter? All you have to do is understand it:
just a dramatization of the process of incarnation. Better run through
it with me: I’ll make it clear, and you can make notes of your troubles
and their solution for the use of future members.<br />
7. The Book of Thoth Surely all terms not in a good dictionary are
explained in the text. I don’t see what I can do about it, in any case;
the same criticism would apply to (say) Bertrand Russell’s Introduction
to Mathematical Philosophy, wouldn’t it? Is x an R-ancestor of y if y
has every Rhereditary that x has, provided x is a term which has the
relation R to something or to which something has the relation R?
(Enthusiastic cries of “Yes, it is!”) He says “A number is anything
which has the number of some class.” Feel better now?<br />
Still, it would be kind of you to go through a page or so with me, and
tell me where the shoe pinches. Of course I have realised the difficulty
long ago; but I don’t know the solution—or if there is a solution. I did
think of calling Magick “Magick Without Tears”; and I did try having my
work crossexamined as I went on by minds of very inferior education or
capacity. In fact, Parts I and II of Book<br />
4 were thus tested.<br />
What about applying the Dedekindian cut to this letter? I am sure you
would not wish it to develop into a Goclenian Sorites, especially as I
fear that I may already have deviated from the d.a pa.t..

It is very good hearing that these letters do good, but rather sad to

habit of pinning things down instantly. (He says ‘re-incarnation’—now
what exactly does he mean by that? He says “it is natural to suppose . .
.”: what is “natural”, and what is implied by supposition?) Practice
this style of criticism; write down what happens. Within a week or two
you will be astounded to discover that you have got what is apparently
little less than a new brain! You must make this a habit, not letting
anything get by the sentries.<br />
Indeed, I want you to go even further; make sure of what is meant by
even the simplest words.<br />
Trace the history of the word with the help of Skeat’s Etymological
Dictionary. E.g. “pretty” means tricky, deceitful; on the other hand,
“hussy” is only “housewife.” It’s amusing, too, this “tabby” refers to
Prince Attab, the grandson of Ommeya—the silk quarter of Baghdad where
utabi, a rich watered silk was sold. This will soon give you the power
of discerning instantly when words are being used to hide meaning or
lack of it. About A.’.A.’., etc.: your resolution is noble, but there is
a letter ready for you which deals with what is really a legitimate
enquiry; necessary, too, with so many hordes of “Hidden Masters” and
“Mahatmas” and so on scurrying all over the floor in the hope of
distracting attention from the inanities of their trusted henchmen.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-i-what-is-magick">Chapter I: What is Magick?</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>What is Magick? Why should anyone study and practice it? Very
natural; the obvious preliminary questions of any subject soever. We
must certainly get all this crystal clear; fear not that I shall fail to
set forth the whole business as concisely as possible yet as fully, as
cogently yet as lucidly, as may prove within my power to do.<br />
At least I need not waste any time on telling you what Magick is not; or
to go into the story of how the word came to be misapplied to conjuring
tricks, and to sham miracles such as are to this day foisted by
charlatan swindlers, either within or without the Roman Communion, upon
a gaping crew of pious imbeciles.<br />
First let me go all Euclidean, and rub your nose in the Definition,
Postulate and Theorems given in my comprehensive (but, alas! too
advanced and too technical) Treatise on the subject.1 Here we are!</p>
<p>I. DEFINITION:<br />
MAGICK is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity
with Will.<br />
(Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within
my knowledge. I therefore take “magical weapons,” pen, ink, and paper; I
write “incantations”—these sentences—in the “magical language” i.e. that
which is understood by people I wish to instruct. I call forth “spirits”
such as printers, publishers, booksellers, and so forth, and constrain
them to convey my message to those people. The composition and
distribution is thus an act of MAGICK by which I cause Changes to take
place in conformity with my Will.)</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li><p>POSTULATE:<br />
ANY required Change may be effected by application of the proper kind
and degree of Force in the proper manner through the proper medium to
the proper object.<br />
(Illustration: I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold. I must
take the right kind of acid, nitrohydrochloric and no other, in
sufficient quantity and of adequate strength, and place it, in a vessel
which will not break, leak or corrode, in such a manner as will not
produce undesirable results, with the necessary quantity of Gold, and so
forth. Every Change has its own conditions.<br />
In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes are not
possible in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or
transform lead into tin, or create men from mushrooms. But it is
theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that
object is capable by nature; and the conditions are covered by the above
postulate.)</p></li>
<li><p>THEOREMS:<br />
</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every intentional act is a Magical Act.+<br />
(Illustration: See “Definition” above.)<br />
</li>
<li>Every successful act has conformed to the postulate.<br />
</li>
<li>Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate
have not been fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Illustrations: There may be failure to understand the case; as when
a doctor makes a wrong diagnosis, and his treatment injures his patient.
There may be failure to apply the right kind of force, as when a rustic
tries to blow out an electric light. There may be failure to apply the
right degree of force, as when a wrestler has his hold broken. There may
be failure to apply the force in the right manner, as when one presents
a cheque at the wrong window of the Bank. There may be failure to employ
the correct medium, as when Leonardo da Vinci found his masterpiece fade
away. The force may be applied to an unsuitable object, as when one
tries to crack a stone, thinking it a nut.)<br />
4. The first requisite for causing any change is thorough qualitative
and quantitative understanding of the condition.<br />
(Illustration: The most common cause of failure in life is ignorance of
one’s own True Will, or of the means by which to fulfil that Will. A man
may fancy himself a painter, and waste his life trying to become one; or
he may be really a painter, and yet fail to understand and to measure
the difficulties<br />
peculiar to that career.)<br />
5. The second requisite of causing any change is the practical ability
to set in right motion the necessary forces.<br />
(Illustration: A banker may have a perfect grasp of a given situation,
yet lack the quality of decision, or the assets, necessary to take
advantage of it.)<br />
6. “Every man and every woman is a star.” That is to say, every human
being is intrinsically an independent individual with his own proper
character and proper motion.<br />
7. Every man and every woman has a course, depending partly on the self,
and partly on the environment which is natural and necessary for each.
Anyone who is forced from his own course, either through not
understanding himself or through external opposition, comes into
conflict with the order of the Universe, and suffers accordingly.<br />
(Illustration: A man may think it his duty to act in a certain way,
through having made a fancy picture of himself, instead of investigating
his actual nature. For example, a woman may make herself miserable for
life by thinking that she prefers love to social consideration, or vice
versa. One woman may stay with an unsympathetic husband when she would
really be happy in an attic with a lover, while another may fool herself
into a romantic elopement when her only true pleasures are those of
presiding at fashionable functions. Again, a boy’s instinct may tell him
to go to sea, while his parents insist on his becoming a doctor. In such
a case, he will be both unsuccessful and unhappy in medicine.<br />
8. A man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is wasting
his strength. He cannot hope to influence his environment
efficiently.<br />
(Illustration: When Civil War rages in a nation, it is in no condition
to undertake the invasion of other countries. A man with cancer employs
his nourishment alike to his own use and to that of the enemy which is
part of himself. He soon fails to resist the pressure of his
environment. In practical life, a man who is doing what his conscience
tells him to be wrong will do it very clumsily. At first!)<br />
9. A man who is doing his True Will has the inertia of the Universe to
assist him.<br />
(Illustration: The first principle of success in evolution is that the
individual should be true to his own nature, and at the same time adapt
himself to his environment.)<br />
10. Nature is a continuous phenomenon, thought we do not know in all
cases how things are connected.<br />
(Illustration: Human consciousness depends on the properties of
protoplasm, the existence of which depends on innumerable physical
conditions peculiar to this planet; and this planet is determined by the
mechanical balance of the whole universe of matter. We may then say that
our consciousness is causally connected with the remotest galaxies; yet
we do not know even how it arises from—or with—<br />
the molecular changes in the brain.)<br />
11. Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity of Nature by
the empirical application of certain principles whose interplay involves
different orders of idea, connected with each other in a way beyond our
present comprehension.<br />
(Illustration: We are able to light cities by rule-of-thumb methods. We
do not know what consciousness is, or how it is connected with muscular
action; what electricity is or how it is connected with the machines
that generate it; and our methods depend on calculations involving
mathematical ideas which have no correspondence in the Universe as we
know it.‡)<br />
12. Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers. Even his
idea of his limitations is based on experience of the past, and every
step in his progress extends his empire. There is, therefore, no reason
to assign theoretical limits§ to what he may be, or to what he may
do.<br />
(Illustration: Two generations ago it was supposed theoretically
impossible that man should ever know the chemical composition of the
fixed stars. It is known that our senses are adapted to receive only an
infinitesimal fraction of the possible rates of vibration. Modern
instruments have enabled us to detect some of these supra-sensibles by
indirect methods, and even to use their peculiar qualities in the
service of man, as in the case of the rays of Hertz and Röntgen. As
Tyndall said, man might at any moment learn to perceive and utilise
vibrations of all conceivable and inconceivable kinds. The question of
Magick is a question of discovering and employing hitherto unknown
forces in nature. We know that they exist, and we cannot doubt the
possibility of mental or physical instruments capable of bringing us in
relation with them.)<br />
13. Every man is more or less aware that his individuality comprises
several orders of existence, even when he maintains that his subtler
principles are merely symptomatic of the changes in his gross vehicle. A
similar order may be assumed to extend throughout nature.<br />
(Illustration: One does not confuse the pain of toothache with the decay
which causes it. Inanimate objects are sensitive to certain physical
forces, such as electrical and thermal conductivity; but neither in us
nor in them—so far as we know—is there any direct conscious perception
of these forces.<br />
Imperceptible influences are therefore associated with all material
phenomena; and there is no reason why we should not work upon matter
through those subtle energies as we do through their material bases. In
fact, we use magnetic force to move iron, and solar radiation to
reproduce images.)<br />
14. Man is capable of being, and using, anything which he perceives; for
everything that he perceives is in a certain sense a part of his being.
He may thus subjugate the whole Universe of which he is conscious to his
individual Will.<br />
(Illustration: Man has used the idea of God to dictate his personal
conduct, to obtain power over his fellows, to excuse his crimes, and for
innumerable other purposes, including that of realising himself as God.
He has used the irrational and unreal conceptions of mathematics to help
him in the construction of mechanical devices. He has used his moral
force to influence the actions even of wild animals. He has employed
poetic genius for political purposes.)<br />
In one sense Magick may be said to be the name given to Science by the
vulgar.<br />
† By “intentional” I mean “willed.” But even unintentional acts so
seeming are not truly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the
Will-to-live.<br />
‡ For instance, “irrational,” “unreal,” and “infinite”
expressions.<br />
§ i.e. except—possibly—in the case of logically absurd questions, such
as the schoolmen discussed in connection with “God.”<br />
15. Every force in the Universe is capable of being transformed into any
other kind of force by using suitable means. There is thus an
inexhaustible supply of any particular kind of force that we may
need.<br />
(Illustration: Heat may be transformed into light and power by using it
to drive dynamos. The vibrations of the air may be used to kill men by
so ordering them in speech as to inflame war-like passions. The
hallucinations connected with the mysterious energies of sex result in
the perpetuation of the species.)<br />
16. The application of any given force affects all the orders of being
which exist in the object to which it is applied, whichever of those
orders is directly affected.<br />
(Illustration: If I strike a man with a dagger, his consciousness, not
his body only, is affected by my act; although the dagger, as such, has
no direct relation therewith. Similarly, the power of my thought may so
work on the mind of another person as to produce far- reaching physical
changes in him, or in others through him.)<br />
17. A man may learn to use any force so as to serve any purpose, by
taking advantage of the above theorems.<br />
(Illustration: A man may use a razor to make himself vigilant over his
speech, by using it to cut himself whenever he unguardedly utters a
chosen word. He may serve the same purpose by resolving that every
incident of his life shall remind him of a particular thing, Making
every impression the starting point of a connected series of thoughts
ending in that thing. He might also devote his whole energies to some
particular object, by resolving to do nothing at variance therewith, and
to make every act turn to the advantage of that object.)<br />
18. He may attract to himself any force of the Universe by making
himself a fit receptacle for it, establishing a connection with it, and
arranging conditions so that its nature compels it to flow toward
him.<br />
(Illustration: If I want pure water to drink, I dig a well in a place
where there is underground water; I prevent it from leaking away; and I
arrange to take advantage of water’s accordance with the laws of
Hydrostatics to fill it.)<br />
19. Man’s sense of himself as separate from, and opposed to, the
Universe is a bar to his conducting its currents. It insulates
him.<br />
(Illustration: A popular leader is most successful when he forgets
himself, and remembers only “The Cause.” Self-seeking engenders
jealousies and schism. When the organs of the body assert their presence
otherwise than by silent satisfaction, it is a sign that they are
diseased. The single exception is the organ of reproduction. Yet even in
this case self-assertion bears witness to its dissatisfaction with
itself, since in cannot fulfil its function until completed by its
counterpart in another organism.)<br />
20. Man can only attract and employ the forces for which he is really
fitted.<br />
(Illustration: You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. A true
man of science learns from every phenomenon. But Nature is dumb to the
hypocrite; for in her there is nothing false. )<br />
21. There is no limit to the extent of the relations of any man with the
Universe in essence; for as soon as man makes himself one with any idea,
the means of measurement cease to exist. But his power to utilise that
force is limited by his mental power and capacity, and by the
circumstances of his human environment.<br />
(Illustration: When a man falls in love, the whole world becomes, to
him, nothing but love boundless and immanent; but his mystical state is
not contagious; his fellow-men are either amused or annoyed.<br />
He can only extend to others the effect which his love has had upon
himself by means of his mental and physical qualities. Thus, Catullus,
Dante, and Swinburne made their love a mighty mover of mankind by virtue
of their power to put their thoughts on the subject in musical and
eloquent language. Again, Cleopatra and other people in authority
moulded the fortunes of many other people by allowing love to influence
their political actions. The Magician, however well he succeeds in
making contact with the secret sources of energy in nature, can only use
them to the extent permitted by his intellectual and moral qualities.
Mohammed’s intercourse with Gabriel was only effective because of his
statesmanship, soldiership, and the sublimity of his command of Arabic.
Hertz’s<br />
discovery of the rays which we now use for wireless telegraphy was
sterile until reflected through the minds and wills of the people who
could take his truth, and transmit it to the world of action by means of
mechanical and economic instruments.)<br />
22. Every individual is essentially sufficient to himself. But he is
unsatisfactory to himself until he has established himself in his right
relation with the Universe.<br />
(Illustration: A microscope, however perfect, is useless in the hands of
savages. A poet, however sublime, must impose himself upon his
generation if he is to enjoy (and even to understand) himself, as
theoretically should be the case.)<br />
23. Magick is the Science of understanding oneself and one’s conditions.
It is the Art of applying that understanding in action.<br />
(Illustration: A golf club is intended to move a special ball in a
special way in special circumstances. A Niblick should rarely be used on
the tee, or a Brassie under the bank of a bunker. But, also, the
use<br />
of any club demands skill and experience.)<br />
24. Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is.<br />
(Illustration: To insist that anyone else shall comply with one’s own
standards is to outrage, not only him, but oneself, since both parties
are equally born of necessity.)<br />
25. Every man must do Magick each time that he acts or even thinks,
since a thought is an internal act whose influence ultimately affects
action, thought it may not do so at the time.<br />
(Illustration: The least gesture causes a change in a man’s own body and
in the air around him: it disturbs the balance of the entire universe
and its effects continue eternally throughout all space.<br />
Every thought, however swiftly suppressed, has its effect on the mind.
It stands as one of the causes of every subsequent thought, and tends to
influence every subsequent action. A golfer may lose a few yards on his
drive, a few more with his second and third, he may lie on the green six
bare inches too far from the hole; but the net result of these trifling
mishaps is the difference of a whole stroke, and so probably between
having and losing the hole.)<br />
26. Every man has a right, the right of self-preservation, to fulfil
himself to the utmost.+<br />
(Illustration: A function imperfectly performed injures, not only
itself, but everything associated with it. If the heart is afraid to
beat for fear of disturbing the liver, the liver is starved for blood,
and avenges itself on the heart by upsetting digestion, which disorders
respiration, on which cardiac<br />
welfare depends.)<br />
27. Every man should make Magick the keynote of his life. He should
learn its laws and live by them.<br />
(Illustration: The Banker should discover the real meaning of his
existence, the real motive which led him to choose that profession. He
should understand banking as a necessary factor in the economic
existence of mankind, instead of as merely a business whose objects are
independent of the general welfare. He should learn to distinguish false
values from real, and to act not on accidental fluctuations but on
considerations of essential importance. Such a banker will prove himself
superior to others; because he will not be an individual limited by
transitory things, but a force of Nature, as impersonal, impartial and
eternal as gravitation, as patient and irresistible as the tides. His
system will not be subject to panic, any more than the law of Inverse
Squares is disturbed by Elections. He will not be anxious about his
affairs because they will not be his; and for that reason he will be
able to direct them with the calm, clear-headed confidence of an
onlooker, with intelligence unclouded by self-interest and power
unimpaired by passion.)<br />
28. Every man has a right to fulfil his own will without being afraid
that it may interfere with that of others; for if he is in his proper
path, it is the fault of others if they interfere with him.<br />
(Illustration: If a man like Napoleon were actually appointed by destiny
to control Europe, he should not be blamed for exercising his rights. To
oppose him would be an error. Anyone so doing would have made a mistake
as to his own destiny, except in so far as it might be necessary for him
to learn the lessons of defeat. The sun moves in space without
interference. The order of Nature provides a orbit for each star. A
clash proves that one or the other has strayed from its course. But as
to each man that keeps his true course, the more firmly he acts, the
less likely are others to get in his way.<br />
His example will help them to find their own paths and pursue them.
Every man that becomes a Magician helps others to do likewise. The more
firmly and surely men move, and the more such action is accepted as the
standard of morality, the less will conflict and confusion hamper
humanity.)<br />
It is no objection that the hypocrite is himself part of Nature. He is
an “endothermic” product, divided against himself, with a tendency to
break up. He will see his own qualities everywhere, and thus obtain a
radical misconception of phenomena. Most religions of the past have
failed by expecting Nature to conform with their ideals of proper
conduct.<br />
† Men of “criminal nature” are simply at issue with their true Wills.
The murderer has the Will-to-live; and his will to murder is a false
will at variance with his true Will, since he risks death at the hands
of Society by obeying his criminal impulse.<br />
Well, here endeth the First Lesson.<br />
That seems to me to cover the ground fairly well; at least, that is what
I have to say when serious analysis is on the agenda.<br />
But there is a restricted and conventional sense in which the word may
be used without straying too far from the above philosophical position.
One might say:—<br />
“Magick is the study and use of those forms of energy which are (a)
subtler than the ordinary physical-mechanical types, (b) accessible only
to those who are (in one sense or another) ‘Initiates’.”<br />
I fear that this may sound rather obscurum per obscurius; but this is
one of these cases— we are likely to encounter many such in the course
of our researches —in which we understand, quite well enough for all
practical purposes, what we mean, but which elude us more and more
successfully the more accurately we struggle to define their
import.<br />
We might fare even worse if we tried to clear things up by making lists
of events in history, tradition, or experience and classifying this as
being, and that as not being, true Magick. The borderland cases would
confuse and mislead us. But—since I have mentioned history—I think it
might help, if I went straight on to the latter part of your question,
and gave you a brief sketch of Magick past, present and future as it is
seen from the inside.<br />
What are the principles of the “Masters”? What are They trying to do?
What have They done in the past? What means do They employ?<br />
As it happens, I have by me a sketch written by M. Gerard Aumont of
Tunis2 some twenty years ago, which covers this subject with reasonable
adequacy.<br />
I have been at the pains of translating it from his French, I hope not
too much reminiscent of the old traduttore, traditore. I will revise it,
divide it (like Gaul) into Three Parts and send it along.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-ii-the-necessity-of-magick-for-all">Chapter II: The
Necessity of Magick for All</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
Right glad am I to hear that you have been so thoroughly satisfied with
my explanation of what Magick is, and on what its theories rest. It is
good, too, hearing how much you were interested in the glimpse that you
have had of some of its work in the world; more, that you grasped the
fact that this apparently recondite and irrelevant information has an
immediate bearing on your personal life of today. Still, I was not
surprised that you should add: “But why should I make a special study
of, and devote my time and energy to acquiring proficiency in, the
Science and Art of Magick?<br />
Ah, well then, perhaps you have not understood my remarks at one of our
earliest interviews as perfectly as you suppose! For the crucial point
of my exposition was that Magick is not a matter extraneous to the main
current of your life, as music, gardening, or collection jade might be.
No, every act of your life is a magical act; whenever from ignorance,
carelessness, clumsiness or what not, you come short of perfect artistic
success, you inevitably register failure, discomfort, frustration.<br />
Luckily for all of us, most of the acts essential to continued life are
involuntary; the”unconscious” has become so used to doing its “True
Will” that there is no need of interference; when such need arises, we
call it disease, and seek to restore the machine to free spontaneous
fulfilment of its function.<br />
But this is only part of the story. As things are, we have all
adventured into an Universe of immeasurable, of incalculable,
possibilities, of situations never contemplated by the trend of
Evolution.<br />
Man is a marine monster; when he decided that it would be better for him
somehow to live on land, he had to grow lungs instead of gills. When we
want to travel over soft snow, we have to invent ski; when we wish to
exchange thoughts, we must arrange a conventional code of sounds, of
knots in string, of carved or written characters—in a word—embark upon
the boundless ocean of hieroglyphics or symbols of one sort or another.
(Presently I shall have to explain the supreme importance of such
systems; in fact, the Universe itself is not, and cannot be, anything
but an arrangement of symbolic characters!)<br />
Here we are, then, caught in a net of circumstances; if we are to do
anything at all beyond automatic vegetative living, we must consciously
apply ourselves to Magick, “the Science and Art” (let me remind you!)
“of causing change to occur in conformity with the Will.” Observe that
the least slackness or error means that things happen which do not thus
conform; when this is so despite our efforts, we<br />
are (temporarily) baffled; when it is our own ignorance of what we ought
to will, or lack of skill in adapting our means to the right end, then
we set up a conflict in our own Nature: our act is suicidal.<br />
Such interior struggle is at the base of nearly all neuroses, as Freud
recently “discovered”—as if this had not been taught, and taught without
his massed errors, by the great teachers of the past! The Taoist
doctrine, in particular, is most precise and most emphatic on this
point; indeed, it may seem to some of us to overshoot the mark; for
nothing is permissible in that scheme but frictionless adjustment and
adaptation to circumstance. “Benevolence and righteousness” are actually
deprecated! That any such ideas should ever have existed (says Lao-tse)
is merely evidence of the universal disorder.<br />
Taoist sectaries appear to assume that Perfection consists in the
absence of any disturbance of the Stream of Nescience; and this is very
much like the Buddhist idea of Nibbana.<br />
We who accept the Law of Thelema, even should we concur in this doctrine
theoretically, cannot admit that in practice the plan would work out;
our aim is that our Nothing, ideally perfect as it is in itself, should
enjoy itself through realizing itself in the fulfilment of all
possibilities. All such phenomena or “point-events” are equally
“illusion”; Nothing is always Nothing; but the projection of Nothing on
this screen of the phenomenal does not only explain, but constitutes,
the Universe. It is the only system which reconciles all the
contradictions inherent in Thought, and in Experience; for in it
“Reality” is “Illusion”, “Free-will” is “Destiny”, the “Self” is the
“Not-Self”; and so for every puzzle of Philosophy.<br />
Not too bad an analogy is an endless piece of string. Like a driving
band, you cannot tie a knot in it; all the complexities you can contrive
are “Tom Fool” knots, and unravel at the proper touch. Always either
Naught or Two! But every new re-arrangement throws further light on the
possible tangles, that is, on the Nature of the String itself. It is
always “Nothing” when you pull it out; but becomes “Everything” as you
play about with it, since there is no limit to the combinations that you
can form from it, save only in your imagination (where the whole thing
belongs!) and that grows mightily with Experience. It is accordingly
well worthwhile to fulfil oneself in every conceivable manner.<br />
It is then (you will say) impossible to “do wrong”, since all phenomena
are equally “Illusion” and the answer is always “Nothing.” In theory one
can hardly deny this proposition; but in practice—how shall I put it?
“The state of Illusion which for convenience I call my present
consciousness is such that the course of action A is more natural to me
that the course of action B?”<br />
Or: A is a shorter cut to Nothing; A is less likely to create internal
conflict.<br />
Will that serve?<br />
Offer a dog a juicy bone, and a bundle of hay; he will naturally take
the bone, whereas a horse would choose the hay. So, while you happen to
imagine yourself to be a Fair Lady seeking the Hidden Wisdom, you come
to me; if you thought you were a Nigger Minstrel you would play the
banjo, and sing songs calculated to attract current coin of the Realm
from a discerning Public! The two actions are ultimately identical—see
AL I, 22 —and your perception of that fact would make you an Initiate of
very high standing; but in the work-a-day world, you are “really” the
Fair Lady, and leave the minstrel to grow infirm and old and hire an
orphan boy to carry his banjo!<br />
Now then, what bothers me it this: Have I or have I not explained this
matter of “Magick”—“Why should I (who have only just heard of it, at
least as a serious subject of study) acquire a knowledge of its
principles, and of the powers conferred by its mastery?” Must I bribe
you with promises of health, wealth, power over others, knowledge,
thaumaturgical skill, success in every worldly ambition—as I could quite
honestly do? I hope there is no such need—and yet, shall I confess
it?—it was only because all the good things of life were suddenly seen
of me to be worthless, that I took the first steps towards the
attainment of that Wisdom which, while enjoying to the full the “Feast
of Life,” guarantees me against surfeit, poison or interruption by the
knowledge that it is all a Dream, and gives me the Power to turn that
dream at will into any form that happens to appeal to my
Inclination.<br />
Let me sum up, very succinctly; as usual, my enthusiasm has lured me
into embroidering my sage discourse with Poets’ Imagery!<br />
Why should you study and practice Magick? Because you can’t help doing

socketing your mashie and not being up with your putt—that’s 6, and you

III: Hieroglyphics: Life and Language Necessarily Symbolic</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
Very natural, the irritation in your last! You write:—<br />
“But why? Why all this elaborate symbolism? Why not say straight out
what you mean? Surely the subject is difficult enough in any case—must
you put on a mask to make it clear? I know you well enough by now to be
sure that you will not fob me off with any Holy-Willie nonsense about
the ineffable, about human language being inadequate to reveal such
Mysteries, about the necessity of constructing a new language to explain
a new system of thought; of course I know that this had to be done in
the case of chemistry, of higher mathematics, indeed of almost all
technical subjects; but I feel that you have some other, deeper
explanation in reserve.<br />
”After all, most of what I am seeking to learn from you has been
familiar to many of the great minds of humanity for many centuries.
Indeed, the Qabalah is a special language, and that is old enough; there
is not much new material to fit into that structure. But why did they,
in the first place, resort to this symbolic jargon?”<br />
You put it very well; and when I think it over, I feel far from sure
that the explanation which I am about to inflict upon you will satisfy
you, or even whether it will hold water! In the last resort, I shall
have to maintain that we are justified by experience, by the empirical
success in communicating thought which has attended, and continues to
attend, our endeavours.<br />
But to give a complete answer, I shall have to go back to the beginning,
and restate the original problem; and I beg that you will not suppose
that I am evading the question, or adopting the Irish method of
answering it by another, though I know it may sound as if I were.<br />
Let me set out by restating our original problem; what we want is Truth;
we want an even closer approach to Reality; and we want to discover and
discuss the proper means of achieving this object.<br />
Very good; let us start by the simplest of all possible enquiries—and
the most difficult —“What is anything?” “What do we know?” and other
questions that spring naturally from these.</p>
<p>I see a tree.<br />
I hear it—rustling or creaking in the wind.<br />
I touch it—hard.<br />
I smell it—acrid.<br />
I taste it—bitter.</p>
<p>Now all the information given by these five senses has to be put
together, although no two agree in any sort of way. The logic by which
we build up our complex idea of a tree has more holes than a
sponge.<br />
But this is to jump far ahead: we must first analyse the single, simple
impression. “I see a tree.” This phenomenon is what is called a
“point-event.” It is the coming together of the two, the seer and the
seen. It is single and simple; yet we cannot conceive of either of them
as anything but complex. And<br />
the Point-Event tells us nothing whatever about either; both, as Herbert
Spencer and God knows how many others have shown, unknowable; it stands
by itself, alone and aloof. It has happened; it is undeniably Reality.
Yet we cannot confirm it; for it can never happen again precisely the
same. What is even more bewildering is that since it takes time for the
eye to convey an impression to the consciousness (it may alter in 1,000
ways in the process!) all that really exists is a memory of the
Point-Event, not the Point-Event itself. What then is this Reality of
which we are so sure? Obviously, it has not got a name, since it never
happened before, or can happen again! To discuss it at all we must
invent a name, and this name (like all names) cannot possibly be
anything more than a symbol.<br />
Even so, as so often pointed out, all we do is to “record the behaviour
of our instruments.” Nor are we much better off when we’ve done it; for
our symbol, referring as it does to a phenomenon unique in itself, and
not to be apprehended by another, can mean nothing to one’s neighbours.
What happens, of course, is that similar, though not identical,
Point-Events happen to many of us, and so<br />
we are able to construct a symbolic language. My memory of the
mysterious Reality resembles yours sufficiently to induce us to agree
that both belong to the same class.<br />
But let me furthermore ask you to reflect on the formation of language
itself. Except in the case of onomatopoeic words and a few others, there
is no logical connection between a thing and the sound of our name for
it. “Bow-wow” is a more rational name than “dog”, which is a mere
convention agreed on by the English, while other nations prefer chien,
hund, cane, kalb, kutta and so on. All symbols, you see, my dear child,
and it’s no good your kicking!<br />
But it doesn’t stop there. When we try to convey thought by writing, we
are bound to sit down solidly, and construct a holy Qabalah out of
nothing. Why would a curve open to the right, sound like the ocean, open
at the top, like you? And all these arbitrary symbolic letters are
combined by just as symbolic and arbitrary devices to take on
conventional meanings, these words again combined into<br />
phrases by no less high-handed a procedure.<br />
And then folk wonder how it is that there should be error and
misunderstanding in the transmission of thought from one person to
another! Rather regard it as a miraculous intervention of Providence
when even one of even the simplest ideas “gets across.” Now then, this
being so, it is evidently good sense to construct one’s own alphabet,
with one’s own very precise definitions, in order to handle an<br />
abstruse and technical subject like Magick. The “ordinary” words such as
God, self, soul, spirit and the rest have been used so many thousand
times in so many thousand ways, usually by writers who knew not, or
cared not for the necessity of definition that to use them to-day in any
scientific essay is almost ludicrous.<br />
That is all, just now, sister; no more of your cavilling, please; sit
down quietly with your 777, and get it by heart!<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />
Fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-iv-the-qabalah-the-best-training-for-memory">Chapter IV:
The Qabalah: The Best Training for Memory</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
Now you must learn Qabalah. Learn this Alphabet of Magick. You must take
it on trust, as a child does his own alphabet. No one has ever found out
why the order of the letters is what it is. Probably there isn’t any
answer.<br />
If you only knew what I am grappling with in the Yi King! the order of
the sixty-four hexagrams. I am convinced that it is extremely
significant, that it implies a sublime system of philosophy. I’ve got
far enough to be absolutely sure that there is a necessary rhythm; and
it’s killing me by millimetres, finding out why each pair succeeds the
last. Forgive these tears!<br />
But our Magical Alphabet is primarily not letters, but figures, not
sounds but mathematical ideas. Sir Humphrey Davy, coming out of his
famous illumination (with some help from Nitrous Oxide he got in)
exclaimed: The Universe is composed solely of ideas. We, analysing this
a little, say: The Universe is a<br />
mathematical expression.<br />
Sir James Jeans might have said this, only his banker advised him to
cash in on God. The simplest form of this expression is 0 = 2, elsewhere
expounded at great length. This 2 might itself be expressed in an
indefinitely great number of ways. Every prime number, including some
not in the series of “natural numbers”, is an individual. The other
numbers with perhaps a few exceptions (e.g. 418) are composed of their
primes.<br />
Each of these ideas may be explained, investigated, understood, by means
very various. Firstly, the Hebrew, Greek and Arabic numbers are also
letters. Then, each of these letters is further described by one of the
(arbitrarily composed) “elements of Nature; the Four (or Five) Elements,
the Seven (or Ten) Planets, and the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.<br />
All these are arranged in a geometrical design composed of
ten”Sephiroth” (numbers) and twentytwo “paths” joining them; this is
called the Tree of Life.<br />
Every idea soever can be, and should be, attributed to one or more of
these primary symbols; thus green, in different shades, is a quality or
function of Venus, the Earth, the Sea, Libra, and others. So also
abstract ideas; dishonesty means “an afflicted Mercury,” generosity a
good, though not always strong, Jupiter; and so on.<br />
The Tree of Life has got to be learnt by heart; you must know it
backwards, forwards, sideways, and upside down; it must become the
automatic background of all your thinking. You must keep on hanging
everything that comes your way upon its proper bough.<br />
At first, of course, all this is dreadfully confusing; but persist, and
a time will come when all the odd bits fit into the jig-saw, and you
behold—with what adoring wonder!—the marvellous beauty and symmetry of
the Qabalistic system.<br />
And then—what a weapon you will have forged!<br />
What power to analyse, to order, to manipulate your thinking!<br />
And please remember when people compliment you on your memory or the
clarity of your thought, to give credit to the Qabalah!<br />
That’s fine, I seem to hear you purr; that looks a lovely machine. The
Design is just elegant; that scarf-pin of yours is perfectly
sweet.<br />
There’s only one point: how to make the damn thing work?<br />
Ah yes, like the one in the Apocalypse, the sting is in your tail.<br />
Honest, you needn’t worry; it works on ball-bearings, and there’s always
those “Thirteen Fountains of Magnificent Oil flowing down the Beard of
Macroprosopus” in case it creaks a little at first. But seriously, all
the mathematics you need is simple Addition and Multiplication.<br />
“Yeah!” you rudely reply. “That’s what you think; but you haven’t got
very far in the Qabalah!”<br />
Too true, sister.<br />
The Book of the Law itself insists upon the fact that it contains a
Qabalah which was beyond me at the time of its dictation, is beyond me
now, and always will be beyond me in this incarnation. Let me direct
your spiritual attention to AL I,54: I, 56: II, 54-55: II, 76: III,
47.<br />
Now there was enough comprehensible at the time to assure me that the
Author of the Book knew at least as much Qabalah as I did: I discovered
subsequently more than enough to make it certain without error that he
knew a very great deal more, and that of an altogether higher order,
than I knew; finally, such glimmerings of light as time and desperate
study have thrown on many other obscure passages, to leave no doubt
whatever in my mind that he is indeed the supreme Qabalist of all time .
. . .<br />
“I asked you how to work it.”<br />
Don’t be so peevish, querulous, and impatient; your zeal is laudable,
but it’s wasting your own time to hurry me.<br />
Well, when you’ve got this Alphabet of Numbers (in its proper shape)
absolutely by heart, with as many sets of attributions as you can commit
to memory without getting confused, you may try a few easy exercises,
beginning with the past.<br />
(“How many sets of attributions?”—Well, certainly, the Hebrew and Greek
Alphabets with the names and numbers of each letter, and its meaning: a
couple of lists of God-names, with a clear idea of the character,
qualities, functions, and importance of each; the “King-scale” of
colour, all the Tarot attributions, of course; then animals, plants,
drugs, per- fumes, a list or two of archangels, angels, intelligences
and spirits—that ought to be enough for a start.)<br />
Now you are armed! Ask yourself: why is the influence of Tiphareth
transmitted to Yesod by the Path of Samekh, a fence, 60, Sagittarius,
the Archer, Art, blue—and so on; but to Hod by the Path of Ayin, an eye,
70, Capricornus, the Goat, the Devil, Indigo, K.T.L.<br />
Thirteen is the number of Achad {Hebrew option}, Unity, and Ahebah
{Hebrew option}, Love; then what word should arise when you expand it by
the Creative Dyad, and get 26; what when you multiply it by 4, and get
52? Then, suppose the Pentagram gets busy, 13 x 5 = 65, what then?<br />
Now don’t you dare to come round crawling to me for the answers; work it
out yourself what sort of words they ought to be, and then check your
result by looking up those numbers in the Sepher Sephiroth: Equinox Vol.
I, No. 8, Supplement.<br />
When you are a real adept at all these well-known calculations “prepare
to enter the Immeasurable Region” and dig out the Unknown.<br />
You must construct your own Qabalah!<br />
Nobody can do it for you. What is your own true Number? You must find it
and prove it to be correct. In the course of a few years, you should
have built yourself a Palace of Ineffable Glory, a Garden of
Indescribable Delight. Nor Time nor Fate can tame those tranquil towers,
those Minarets of Music, or fade one blossom in those avenues of
Perfume!<br />
Humph! Nasty of me: but it has just stuck me that it might be just as
well if you made a Sepher Sephiroth of your own! What a positively
beastly thing to suggest! However, I do suggest it.<br />
After all, it’s simple enough. Every word you come across, add it up,
stick it down against that number in a book kept for the purpose. That
may seem tedious and silly; why should you do all over again the work
that I have already done for you? Reason: simple. Doing it will teach
you Qabalah as nothing else could. Besides, you won’t be all cluttered
up with words that mean nothing to you; and<br />
if it should happen that you want a word to explain some particular
number, you can look it up in my Sepher Sephiroth.<br />
By this method, too, you may strike a rich vein of words of your own
that I have altogether missed.<br />
For a start, of course, you should put down the words that are bound to
come in your way No doubt, a Really Great Teacher would have said:
“Beware! Use my Dictionary, and mine alone! All others are spurious!”
But then I’m not a R.G.T. of that kind.<br />
In any case: numbers like 11, 13, 31, 37, and their multiples; the names
of God and the principal angels; the planetary and geomantic names; and
your own private and particular name with its branches. After that, let
your work on the Astral Plane guide you. When investigating the name and
other words communicated to you by such beings as you meet there, or
invoke, many more will come up in their proper connections. Very soon
you will have quite a nice little Sepher Sephiroth of your very
own.<br />
Remember to aim, above all things, at coherence.<br />
It is excellent practice, but the way, to do some mental arithmetic on
your walks; acquire the habit of adding up any names that you have come
across in your morning’s reading. Nietzsche has well observed that the
best thoughts come by walking; and it has happened to me, more than once
or twice, that really important correspondences have come, as by a
flashlight, when I was padding the old hoof.<br />
You will have noticed that in this curt exposition I have confined
myself to Gematria, the direct relation of number and word, omitting any
reference to Notarikon, the accursed art of making words out of
initials, like (in profane life) Wren and Gestapo and their horrid
brood, or to Temura1 , the art of altering the position of the letters
in a word, a sort of cipher; for these are almost always
frivolous.<br />
To base any serious calculations on them would be absurd.<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />
Fraternally,<br />
666<br />
P.S. You should study the Equinox Vol. I, No. 5, “The Temple of Solomon
the King” for a more elaborate exposition of the Qabalah.<br />
1: Temura is more normally understood as a form of letter substitution
cipher rather than the formation of anagrams as Crowley seems to suggest
here; historically it appears that its applications have been as much in
the realm of mundane cryptography as in Qabalistic exegesis. For
example, the Viginaire cipher, held unbreakable for a few centuries,
used a Latin version of the Qabalistic (so called) “Right Table of
Commutations” – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-v-the-universe-the-0-2-equation">Chapter V: The
Universe: The 0 = 2 Equation</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
Yes, I admit everything! It is all my fault. Looking over my past
writings, I do see that my only onepointed attempt to set forth a sound
ontology was my early fumbling letter brochure Berashith. Since then, I
seem to have kept assuming that everybody knew all about it; referring
to it, quoting it, but never sitting down seriously to demonstrate the
thesis, or even to state it in set terms. Chapter 0 of Magick in Theory
and Practice skates gently over it; the “Naples Arrangement” in The Book
of Thoth dodges it with really diabolical ingenuity. I ask myself why.
It is exceedingly strange, because every time I think of the Equation, I
am thrilled with a keen glow of satisfaction that this sempiternal
Riddle of the Sphinx should have been answered at last.<br />
So then let me now give myself the delight, and you the comfort, of
stating the problem from its beginning, and proving the soundness of the
solution—of showing that the contradiction of this Equation is
unthinkable. — — Are you ready? Forward! Paddle!<br />
A. We are aware.<br />
B. We cannot doubt the existence (whether “real” or “illusory” makes no
difference) of something, because doubt itself is a form of
awareness.<br />
C. We lump together all that of which we are aware under the convenient
name of “Existence”, or “The Universe”. Cosmos is not so good for this
purpose; that word implies “order”, which in the present stage of our
argument, is a mere assumption.<br />
D. We also tend to think of the Universe as containing things of which
we are not aware; but this is altogether unjustifiable, although it is
difficult to think at all without making some such assumption.<br />
For instance, one may come upon a new branch of knowledge—say, histology
or Hammurabi or the language of the Iroquois or the poems of the
Hermaphrodite of Panormita. It seems to be there already waiting for us;
we simply cannot believe that we are making it all up as we go along.
For all that, it is sheer sophistry; we may merely be unfolding the
contents of our own minds. Then again, does a thing cease to exist if we
forget it? The answer is that one cannot be sure. Personally, I feel
convinced of the existence of an Universe outside my own immediate
awareness; but it is true, even so, that it does not exist for me unless
and until it takes its place as part of my consciousness.<br />
E. All this paragraph D is in the nature of a digression, for what you
may think of it does not at all touch the argument of this letter. But
it had to be put in, just to prevent your mind from raising irrelevant
objections. Let me continue, then, from C.<br />
F. Something is This something appears incalculably vast and complex.
How did it come to be? This, briefly, is the “Riddle of the Universe,”
which has been always the first preoccupation of all serious
philosophers since men began to think at all.<br />
G. The orthodox idiot answer, usually wrapped up in obscure terms in the
hope of concealing from the enquirer the fact that it is not an answer
at all, but an evasion, is: God created it. Then, obviously, who created
God? Sometimes we have a Demiurge, a creative God behind whom is an
eternal formless Greatness—anything to confuse the issue!<br />
Sometimes the Universe is supported by an elephant; he, in turn, stands
on a tortoise . . . by that time it is hoped that the enquirer is too
tired and muddled to ask what holds up the tortoise.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a great Father and Mother crystallize out of some huge
cloudy confusion of “Elements” and so on. But nobody answers the
question; at least, none of these God-inventing mules, with their
incurably commonplace minds.<br />
H. Serious philosophy has always begun by discarding all these
puerilities. It has of necessity been divided into these schools: the
Nihilist, the Monist, and the Dualist.<br />
I. The last of these is, on the surface, the most plausible; for almost
the first thing that we notice on inspecting the Universe is what the
Hindu schools call “the Pairs of Opposites.” This too, is very
convenient, because it lends itself so readily to orthodox theology; so
we have Ormuzd and Ahriman, the Devas and the Asuras, Osiris and Set, et
cetera and da capo, personifications of “Good” and “Evil.”<br />
The foes may be fairly matched; but more often the tale tells of a
revolt in heaven. In this case, “Evil” is temporary; soon, especially
with the financial help of the devout, the “devil” will be “cast into
the Bottomless Pit” and “the Saints will reign with Christ in glory for
ever and ever, Amen!” Often a “redeemer,” a “dying God,” is needed to
secure victory to Omnipotence; and this is usually what little vulgar
boys might call a “touching story!”<br />
J. The Monist (or Advaitist) school, is at once subtler and more
refined; it seems to approach the ultimate reality (as opposed to the
superficial examination of the Dualists) more closely. It seems to me
that this doctrine is based upon a sorites of doubtful validity. To tell
you the hideously shameful truth, I hate this doctrine so rabidly that I
can hardly trust myself to present it fairly! But I will try.<br />
Meanwhile, you can study it in the Upanishads, in the Bhagavad-Gita, in
Ernst Haeckel’s The Riddle of the Universe, and dozens of other
classics. The dogma appears to excite its dupes to dithyrambs. I have to
admit the “poetry” of the idea; but there is something in me which
vehemently rejects it with excruciating and vindictive violence.
Possibly, this is because part of our own system runs parallel with the
first equations of theirs.<br />
K. The Monists perceive quite clearly and correctly that it is absurd to
answer the question “How came these Many things (of which we are aware)
to be?” by saying that they came from Many; and “Many” in this
connection includes Two. The Universe must therefore be a single
phenomenon: make it eternal and all the rest of it—i.e. remove all limit
of any kind—and the Universe explains itself. How then can Opposites
exist, as we observe them to do? Is it not the very essence of our
original Sorites that the Many must be reducible to the One? They see
how awkward this is; so the “devil” of the Dualist is emulsified and
evaporated into “illusion;” what they call “Maya” or some equivalent
term.<br />
“Reality” for them consists solely of Brahman, the supreme Being
“without quantity or quality.” They are compelled to deny him all
attributes, even that of Existence; for to do so would instantly limit
them, and so hurl them headlong back in to Dualism. All that of which we
are aware must obviously possess limits, or it could have no
intelligible meaning for us; if we want “pork,” we must specify its
qualities and quantities; at the very least, we must be able to
distinguish it from “that-which-is-notpork.”<br />
But—one moment, please!<br />
L. There is in Advaitism a most fascinating danger; that is that, up to
a certain point, “Religious Experience” tends to support this theory. A
word on this. Vulgar minds, such as are happy with a personal God,
Vishnu, Jesus, Melcarth, Mithras, or another, often excite
themselves—call it “Energised Enthusiasm” if you want to be
sarcastic!—to the point of experiencing actual Visions of the objects of
their devotion. But these people have not so much as asked themselves
the original question of “How come?” which is our present subject. Sweep
them into the discard!<br />
M. Beyond Vishvarupadarshana, the vision of the Form of Vishnu, beyond
that yet loftier vision which corresponds in Hindu classification to our
“Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel”, is that called
Atmadarshana, the vision (or apprehension, a much better word) of the
Universe as a single phenomenon, outside all limitations, whether of
time, space, causality, or what not. Very good, then! Here we are with
direct realisation of the Advaitist theory of the Universe. Everything
fits perfectly. Also, when I say “realisation,” I want you to understand
that I mean what I say in a sense so intense and so absolute that it is
impossible to convey my meaning to anyone who has not undergone that
experience.+<br />
How do we judge the “reality” of an ordinary impression upon
consciousness? Chiefly by its intensity, by its persistence, by the fact
that nobody can argue us out of our belief in it. As people said of
Berkeley’s ‘Idealism’—“his arguments are irrefutable but they fail to
carry conviction.” No sceptical, no idealist queries can persuade us
that a kick in the pants is not ‘real’ in any reasonable sense of the
word. Moreover memory reassures us. However vivid a dream may be at the
time, however it may persist throughout the years (though it is rare for
any dream, unless frequently repeated, or linked to waking impressions
by some happy conjunction of circumstances, to remain long in the mind
with any clear-cut vision) it is hardly ever mistaken for an event of
actual life. Good: then, as waking life is to dream, so—yes, more so!—is
Religious Experience as above described to that life common to all of
us.<br />
It is not merely easy, it is natural, not merely natural, but
inevitable, for anyone who has experienced “Samadhi” (this word
conveniently groups the higher types of vision +) to regard normal life
as “illusion” by comparison with this state in which all problems are
resolved, all doubts driven out, all limitations abolished.<br />
But even beyond Atmadarshana comes the experience called Sivadarshana,§
in which this Atman (or Brahman), this limit-destroying Universe, is
itself abolished and annihilated.<br />
(And, with its occurrence, smash goes the whole of the Advaitist
theory!)<br />
It is a commonplace to say that no words can describe this final
destruction. Such is the fact; and there is nothing one can do about it
but put it down boldly as I have done above. It does not matter to our
present purpose; all that we need to know is that the strongest prop of
the Monist structure has broken off short.<br />
Moreover, is it really adequate to postulate an origin of the Universe,
as they inevitably do? Merely to deny that there ever was a beginning by
saying that this “one” is eternal fails to satisfy me.<br />
What is very much worse, I cannot see that to call Evil “illusion” helps
us at all. When the Christian Scientist hears that his wife has been
savagely mauled by her Peke, he has to smile, and say that “there is a
claim of error.” Not good enough.<br />
You must read The Soldier and the Hunchback: ! And ? in the Equinox I,
1.<br />
† I have discussed this and the following points very fully in Book 4
Part I, pp. 63-89.<br />
‡ “Vision” is a dreadfully bad word for it; “trance” is better, but
idiots always mix it up with hypnotism.<br />
§ Possibly almost identical with the Buddhist Neroda-Samapatti.<br />
N. It has taken a long while to clear the ground. That I did not expect;
the above propositions are so familiar to me, they run so cleanly
through my mind, that, until I came to set them down in order, I had no
idea what a long and difficult business it all was.<br />
Still, it’s a long lane, etc. We have seen that “Two” (or “Many”) are
unsatisfactory as origin, if only because they can always be reduced to
“One”; and “One” itself is no better, because, among other things, it
finds itself forced to deny the very premises on which it was
founded.<br />
Shall we be any better off if we assume that “Ex nihilo nihil fit” is a
falsehood, that the origin of All Things is Nothing? Let us see!<br />
O. Shall we first glance at the mathematical aspect of Nothing?
(Including its identical equation in Logic.) This I worked out so long
ago as 1902 e.g. in, Berashith, which you will find reprinted in the
Sword of Song, and in my Collected Works, Vol. I. The argument may be
summarised as follows.<br />
When, in the ordinary way of business, we write 0, we should really
write 0n. 1 For 0 implies that the subject is not extended in any
dimension under discussion. Thus a line may be two feet in length, but
in breadth and depth the coefficient is Zero. We could describe it as 2f
× 0b × 0d, or n2f + 0b + 0d.2<br />
What I proposed in considering “What do we mean by Nothing?” was to
consider every possible quality of any object as a dimension.<br />
For instance, one might describe this page as being nf + n’b + n’’d + 0
redness + 0 amiability + 0 velocity + 0 potential and so on, until you
had noted and measured all the qualities it possesses, and excluded all
that it does not. For convenience, we may write this expression as
Xf+b+d+r+a+v+p— using the initials of the qualities which we call
dimensions.<br />
Just one further explanation in pure mathematics. To interpret X1, X1+1
or X2, and so on, we assume the reference to be to spatial dimensions.
Thus suppose X1 to be a line a foot long, X2 will be a plane a foot
square, and X3 a cube measuring a foot in each dimension. But what about
X4?<br />
There are no more spatial dimensions. Modern mathematics has
(unfortunately, I think) agreed to consider this fourth dimension as
time. Well, and X{5}? To interpret this expression, we may begin to
consider other qualities, such as electric capacity, colour, moral
attributes, and so on.3 But this remark, although necessary, leads us
rather away from our main thesis instead of toward it.<br />
P. What happens when we put a minus sign before the index (that small
letter up on the right) instead of a plus? Quite simple. x2 = X1+1 = X1
+ X1. With a minus, we divide instead of multiplying. Thus, X3-2 = X3 ÷
X2 = X1, just as if you had merely subtracted the 2 from the 3 in the
index.<br />
Now, at last, we come to the point of real importance to our thesis: how
shall we interpret X0? We may write it, obviously, as X1-1 or
Xn-n. Good, divide. Then X1 ÷ X1 = 1. This is the same, clearly enough,
whatever X may be.<br />
Q. Ah, but what we started to do was discover the meaning of Nothing. It
is not correct to write it simply as 0; for that 0 implies an index 01,
or 0{2}, or 0n. And if our Nothing is to be absolute Nothing, then there
is not only no figure, but no index either. So we must write it as
00.<br />
What is the value of this expression? We proceed as before;
divide.<br />
00 = 0n-n = 0n ÷ 0n = (0n ÷ 1) × (1 ÷ 0n). Of course 0n ÷ 1 remains 0;
but 1 ÷ 0{n} = 8.<br />
That is, we have a clash of the “infinitely great” with the “infinitely
small;” that knocks out the “infinity” (and Advaitism with it!) and
leaves us with an indeterminate but finite number of utter variety. That
is: 00 can only be interpreted as “The Universe that we know.”<br />
R. So much for one demonstration. Some people have found fault with the
algebra; but the logical Equivalent is precisely parallel. Suppose I
wish to describe my study in one respect: I can say “No dogs are in my
study,” or “Dogs are not in my study.” I can make a little diagram: D is
the world of dogs; S is my study. Here it is:<br />
The squares are quite separate. The whole world outside the square D is
the world of no dogs:<br />
outside the square S, the world of no-study. But suppose now that I want
to make the Zero absolute, like our 00, I must say “No dogs are not in
my study.”<br />
Or, “There is no absence-of-dog in my study.” That is the same as
saying: “Some dog are in my study;” diagram again:<br />
In Diagram 1, “the world where no dogs are” included the whole of my
study; in Diagram 2 that<br />
absence-of-dog is no longer there; so one or more of them must have got
in somehow.<br />
That’s that; I know it may be a little difficult at first; fortunately
there is a different way—the Chinese way—of stating the theorem in very
much simpler terms.<br />
S. The Chinese, like ourselves, begin with the idea of “Absolute
Nothing.” They “make an effort, and call it the Tao;” but that is
exactly what the Tao comes to mean, when we examine it. They see quite
well, as we have done above, that merely to assert Nothing is not to
explain the Universe; and they proceed to do so by means of a
mathematical equation even simpler than ours, involving as it does no
operations beyond simple addition and subtraction. They say “Nothing
obviously means Nothing; it has no qualities nor quantities.” (The
Advaitists said the same, and then stultified themselves completely by
calling it One!) “But,” continue the sages of the Middle Kingdom, “it is
always possible to reduce any expression to Nothing by taking any two
equal and opposite terms.” (Thus n = (-n) = 0.) “We ought therefore to
be able to get any expression that we want from Nothing; we merely have
to be careful that the terms shall be precisely opposite and equal.” (0
= n + (-n). This then they did, and began to diagrammatize the Universe
as the Î—a pair of opposites, the Yang or active male, and the Yin or
passive Female, principles. They represented the Yang by an unbroken (
——— ), the Yin by a broken ( — — ), line. (The first manifestation in
Nature of these two is Thƒi Yang, the Sun, and the Thƒi Yin, the Moon.)
This being a little large and loose, they doubled these lines, and
obtained the four Hsiang. They then took them three at a time, and got
the eight Kwa. These represent the development from the original OE
{S.B. cap “I”} to the Natural Order of the Elements.<br />
I shall call the male principle M, the Female F.<br />
Note how admirably they have preserved the idea of balance. M.1. and
F.1. are perfection. M.2. and F.2. still keep balance in their lines.
The four “elements” show imperfection; yet they are all balanced as
against each other. Note, too, how apt are the ideograms. M.3. shows the
flames flickering on the hearth, F.3., the wave on the solid bottom of
the sea; M.4., the mutable air, with impenetrable space above, and
finally F.4., the thin crust of the earth masking the interior energies
of the planet. They go in to double these Kwâ, thus reaching the
sixty-four Hexagrams of the Yî King, which is not only a Map, but a
History of the Order of Nature.<br />
It is pure enthusiastic delight in the Harmony and Beauty of the System
that has led me thus far afield; my one essential purpose is to show how
the Universe was derived by these Wise Men from Nothing.<br />
When you have assimilated these two sets of Equations, when you have
understood how 0 = 2 is the unique, the simple, and the necessary
solution of the Riddle of the Universe, there will be, in a sense,
little more for you to learn about the Theory of Magick.<br />
You should, however, remember most constantly that the equation of the
Universe, however complex it may seem, inevitably reels out to Zero; for
to accomplish this is the formula of your Work as a Mystic. To remind
you, and to amplify certain points of the above, let me quote from
Magick pp. 152- 3 footnote2.<br />
All elements must at one time have been separate—that would be the case
with great heat. Now when atoms get to the sun, we get that immense
extreme heat, and all the elements are themselves again. Imagine that
each atom of each element possesses the memory of all his adventures in
combination. By the way, that atom (fortified with that memory) would
not be the same atom; yet it is, because it has gained nothing from
anywhere except this memory. Therefore, by the lapse of time, and by
virtue of memory, a thing could become something more than itself; thus
a real development is possible. One can then see a reason for any
element deciding to go through this series of incarnations, because so,
and only so, can he go; and he suffers the lapse of memory which he has
during these incarnations, because he knows he will come through
unchanged.<br />
Therefore you can have an infinite number of gods, individual and equal
though diverse, each one supreme and utterly indestructible. This is
also the only explanation of how a “Perfect Being” could create a world
in which war, evil, etc., exist. God is only an appearance, because
(like “good”) it cannot affect the substance itself, but only multiply
its combinations. This is something the same as mystic monotheism; but
all parts of himself, so that their interplay is false. If we presuppose
many elements, their interplay is natural.<br />
It is no objection to this theory to ask who made the elements—the
elements are at least there, and God, when you look for him, is not
there. Theism is obscurum per obscurius. A male star is built up from
the centre outwards; a female from the circumference inwards. This is
what is meant when we say that woman has no soul. It explains fully the
difference between the sexes.<br />
Every “act of love under will” has the dual result (1) the creation of a
child combining the qualities of its parents, (2) the withdrawal by
ecstasy into Nothingness. Please consult what I have elsewhere written
on “The Formula of Tetragrammaton;” the importance of this at the moment
is to show how 0 and 2 appear constantly in Nature as the common Order
of Events.<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />

1: Add comments to distinguish indices (Abstract Algebra) from powers of
numbers. I shouldn’t, but as a physicist, I have to say that Crowley is
giving an erroneous layman’s opinion and his usage of math notation
cannot be considered correct. These expressions are ok as text, but not
as math without redefinition through Abstract Algebra, a field Crowley
appears not to know by name. The ideas are valid, but the expressions
are misleading. It might be wise to add a footnote about the notation
being non-traditional. Notably, this line defies Pythagoras! Crowley’s
notation with superscripts is the problem. It looks like powers of
numbers instead of indices. He probably intended indices, but didn’t
know how to represent them or flag them in typography – WEH. The problem
is that Crowley’s later reasoning, in particular his calculations of the
value of 00, only make sense if he means powers. Now there is nothing
per se to stop us representing his “categories” in terms of an
ndimensional space, but each category is incommensurable with the others
– T.S.<br />
2: This is bogus math, plain and simple. If d1, d2, … dn are the
dimensions in n dimensional space of our object, the volume of
n-dimensional space it occupies will be d1 × d2 × … ×dn; if we multiply
each dimension by x, the volume of the whole thing is multiplied by xn.
As noted above, the way Crowley develops the argument indicates he is
thinking of powers but his use thereof at this point is<br />
wrong – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-vi-the-three-schools-of-magick-1">Chapter VI: The Three
Schools of Magick (1)</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Here is the first section of M. Gerard Aumont’s promised essay; it
was originally called “The Three Schools of Magick.” (Don’t be cross,
please, because it is not in the form of a personal letter!)<br />
There is today much misunderstanding of the meaning of the term
“Magick.” Many attempts have been made to define it, but perhaps the
best for our present purpose of historical-ideological exposition will
be this—Magick is the Science of the Incommensurables.<br />
This is one of the many restricted uses of the word; one suited to the
present purpose.<br />
It is particularly to be noted that Magick, so often mixed up in the
popular idea of a religion, has nothing to do with it. It is, in fact,
the exact opposite of religion; it is, even more than Physical Science,
its irreconcilable enemy.<br />
Let us define this difference clearly.<br />
Magick investigates the laws of Nature with the idea of making use of
them. It only differs from “profane” science by always keeping ahead of
it. As Fraser has shown, Magick is science in the tentative stage; but
it may be, and often is, more than this. It is science which, for one
reason or another, cannot be declared to the profane.<br />
Religion, on the contrary, seeks to ignore the laws of Nature, or to
escape them by appeal to a postulated power which is assumed to have
laid them down. The religious man is, as such, incapable of
understanding what the laws of Nature really are. (They are
generalisations from the order of observed fact.)<br />
The History of Magick has never been seriously attempted. For one
reason, only initiates pledged to secrecy know much about it; for
another, every historian has been talking about some more or less
conventional idea of Magick, not of the thing itself. But Magick has led
the world from before the beginning of history, if only for the reason
that Magick has always been the mother of Science. It is, therefore, of
extreme importance that some effort should be made to understand
something of the subject; and there is, therefore, no apology necessary
for essaying this brief outline of its historical aspects.<br />
A few amendments—very few—have been necessitated by the lapse of time.
There have always been, at least in nucleus, three main Schools of
Philosophical practice. (We use the word “philosophical” in the old good
broad sense, as in the phrase “Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society for the Advancement of Knowledge.”)<br />
It is customary to describe these three Schools as Yellow, Black, and
White. The first thing necessary is to warn the reader that they must by
no means be confounded with racial distinctions of colour; and they
correspond still less with conventional symbols such as yellow caps,
yellow robes, black magick, white witchcraft, and the like. The danger
is only the greater that these analogies are often as alluring as they
prove on examination to be misleading.<br />
These Schools represent three perfectly distinct and contrary theories
of the Universe, and, therefore, practices of spiritual science. The
magical formula of each is as precise as a theorem of
trigonometry.<br />
Each assumes as fundamental a certain law of Nature, and the subject is
complicated by the fact that each School, in a certain sense, admits the
formulæ of the other two. It merely regards them as in some way
incomplete, secondary, or illusory. Now, as will be seen later, the
Yellow School stand aloof from the other two by the nature of its
postulates. But the Black School and the White are<br />
always more or less in active conflict; and it is because just at this
moment that conflict is approaching a climax that it is necessary to
write this essay. The adepts of the White School consider the present
danger to mankind so great that they are prepared to abandon their
traditional policy of silence, in order to enlist in their ranks the
profane of every nation.<br />
We are in possession of a certain mystical document which we may
describe briefly, for convenience sake, as an Apocalypse of which we
hold the keys, thanks to the intervention of the Master who has appeared
at this grave conjuncture of Fate. This document consists of a series of
visions, in which we hear the various Intelligences whose nature it
would be hard to define, but who are at the very least endowed with
knowledge and power far beyond anything that we are accustomed to regard
as proper to the human race.<br />
We must quote a passage from one of the most important of these
documents. The doctrine is conveyed, as is customary among Initiates, in
the form of a parable. Those who have attained even a mediocre degree of
enlightenment are aware that the crude belief of the faithful and the
crude infidelity of the scoffer, with regard to matters of fact, are
merely childish. Every incident in Nature, true or false, possesses a
spiritual significance. It is this significance, and only this
significance, that possesses any philosophical value to the
Initiate.<br />
The orthodox need not be shocked, and the enlightened need not be
contemptuous, to learn that the passage which we are about to quote, is
a parable based on the least decorous of the Biblical legends which
refer to Noah.1 It simply captures for its own purposes the convenience
of Scripture.<br />
Liber CDXVIII, The Vision and the Voice, edition with Introduction and
Commentary by 666.<br />
Thelema Publishing Co., Barstow, California2. (Here follows the excerpt
from the Vision.)<br />
And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nakedness of the
Most High, for he is drunken upon the wine that is the blood of the
adepts. And BABALON hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and she
hath fled away, and left him naked, and she hath called her children
together saying:<br />
Come up with me, and let us make a mock of the nakedness of the Most
High.<br />
And the first of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth, walking
backwards, and was white. And the second of the adepts covered his shame
with a cloth, walking sideways, and was yellow. And the third of the
adepts made a mock of His nakedness, walking forwards, and was black.
And these are the three great schools of the Magi, who are also the
three Magi that journeyed unto Bethlehem; and because thou hast not
wisdom, thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or if the three
schools be not one.<br />
This doctrine of the Three Schools is of extreme interest. Roughly, it
may be said that the White is the Pure Mystic, whose attitude to God is
one of reverence. The Yellow School conceals the Mysteries indeed, but
examines them as it goes along. The Black School is that of pure
Scepticism3. We are now ready to study the philosophical bases of these
three Schools.<br />
We must, however, enter a caveat against too literal an interpretation,
even of the parable. It may be suspected, for reasons which should be
apparent after further investigation of the doctrines of the Three
Schools, that this parable was invented by an Intelligence of the Black
School, who was aware of his iniquity, and thought to transform it into
righteousness by the alchemy of making a boast of it.<br />
The intelligent reader will note the insidious attempt to identify the
doctrine of the Black School with the kind of black magic that is
commonly called Diabolism. In other words, this parable is itself an
example of an exceedingly subtle black magical operation, and the
contemplation of such devices carried far enough beings us to an
understanding of the astoundingly ophidian processes of Magicians. Let
not the profane reader dismiss such subtleties from his mind as
negligible nonsense.<br />
It is cunning of this kind that determines the price of potatoes.<br />
The above digression is perhaps not so inexcusable as it may seem on a
first reading. Careful study of it should reveal the nature of the
thought-processes which are habitually used by the secret Masters of the
human race to determine its destiny.<br />
When everyone has done laughing, I will ask you to compare the real
effects produced on the course of human affairs by Caesar, Attila, and
Napoleon, on the one hand; of Plato, the Encyclopaedists, and Karl Marx
on the other.<br />
The Yellow School of Magick considers, with complete scientific and
philosophical detachment, the fact of the Universe as a fact. Being
itself apart of that Universe, it realises its impotence to alter the
totality in the smallest degree. To put it vulgarly, it does not try to
raise itself from the ground by pulling at its socks. It therefore
opposes to the current of phenomena no reaction either of hatred or of
sympathy.<br />
So far as it attempts to influence the course of events at all, it does
so in the only intelligent way conceivable. It seeks to diminish
internal friction.<br />
It remains, therefore, in a contemplative attitude. To use the terms of
Western philosophy, there is in its attitude something of the stoicism
of Zeno; or of the Pickwickianism, if I may use the term, of Epicurus.
The ideal reaction to phenomena is that of perfect elasticity. It
possesses something of the cold-bloodedness of mathematics; and for this
reason it seems fair to say, for the purposes of elementary study, that
Pythagoras is its most adequate exponent in European philosophy.<br />
Since the discovery of Asiatic thought, however, we have no need to take
our ideas at second-hand.<br />
The Yellow School of Magick possesses one perfect classic. The Tao Teh
King.+<br />
It is impossible to find any religion which adequately represents the
thought of this masterpiece. Not only is religion as such repugnant to
science and philosophy, but from the very nature of the tenets of the
Yellow School, its adherents are not going to put themselves to any
inconvenience for the enlightenment of a lot of people whom they
consider to be hopeless fools.<br />
At the same time, the theory of religion, as such, being a tissue of
falsehood, the only real strength of any religion is derived from its
pilferings of Magical doctrine; and, religious persons being by
definition entirely unscrupulous, it follows that any given religion is
likely to contain scraps of Magical doctrine, filched more or less
haphazard from one school or the other as occasion serves.<br />
Let the reader, therefore, beware most seriously of trying to get a
grasp of this subject by means of siren analogies. Taoism has as little
to do with the Tao Teh King as the Catholic Church with the
Gospel.<br />
The Tao Teh King inculcates conscious inaction, or rather unconscious
inaction, with the object of minimizing the disorder of the world. A few
quotations from the text should make the essence of the doctrine
clear4.<br />
X 3 Here is the Mystery of Virtue. It createth all and nourisheth all;
yet it doth not adhere to them. It operateth all; but knoweth not of it,
nor proclaimeth it; it directeth all, but without conscious
control.<br />
XXII 2 Therefore the sage concentrateth upon one Will, and it is as a
light to the whole world. Hiding himself, he shineth; withdrawing
himself, he attracteth notice; humbling himself, he gaineth force to
achieve his Will. Because he striveth not, no man may contend against
him.<br />
XLIII 1 The softest substance hunteth down the hardest. The
Unsubstantial penetrateth where there is no opening. Here is the Virtue
of Inertia2. Few are they who attain: whose speech is Silence, whose
Work is Inertia.<br />
XLVIII 3 He who attracteth to himself all that is under Heaven doth so
without effort. He who maketh effort is not able to attract it.<br />
LVIII 3 The wise man is foursquare and avoideth aggression; his corners
do not injure others. He moveth in a straight line, and turneth not
aside therefrom; he is brilliant, but doth not blind with his
brightness.<br />
LXIII 2 Do great things while they are yet small, hard things while they
are yet easy; for all things, how great or hard soever, have a beginning
when they are little and easy. So thus the wise man accomplisheth the
greatest tasks without undertaking anything important.<br />
LXXVI 2 So then rigidity and hardness are the stigmata of death;
elasticity and adaptability of life3.<br />
He then who putteth forth strength is not victorious; even as a strong
tree filleth the embrace4. Thus the hard and rigid have the inferior
place, the soft and elastic the superior.<br />
Enough, I think, for this part of the essay.<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-vii-the-three-schools-of-magick-2">Chapter VII: The
Three Schools of Magick (2)</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
Hoping that you are now recovered from the devastating revelations in
the matter of the Yellow School, I must ask you to brace yourself for
disclosures even more formidable about the Black. Do not confuse with
the Black Lodge, or the Black Brothers. The terminology is unfortunate,
but it wasn’t I that did it. Now then, to work!<br />
The Black School of Magick, which must by no means be confused with the
School of Black Magick or Sorcery, which latter is a perversion of the
White tradition, is distinguished fundamentally from the Yellow School
in that it considers the Universe not as neutral, but as definitely a
curse. Its primary theorem is the “First Noble Truth” of the
Buddha—“Everything is Sorrow.” In the primitive classics of this School
the idea of sorrow is confused with that of sin. (This idea of universal
lamentation is presumably responsible for the choice of black as its
symbolic colour. And yet? Is not white the Chinese hue of
mourning?)<br />
The analysis of the philosophers of this School refers every phenomenon
to the category of sorrow. It is quite useless to point out to them that
certain events are accompanied with joy: they continue their ruthless
calculations, and prove to your satisfaction, or rather dissatisfaction,
that the more apparently pleasant an event is, the more malignantly
deceptive is its fascination. There is only one way of escape even
conceivable, and this way is quite simple, annihilation. (Shallow
critics of Buddhism have wasted a great deal of stupid ingenuity on
trying to make out that Nirvana or Nibbana means something different
from what etymology, tradition and the evidence of the Classics combine
to define it. The word means, quite simply, cessation: and it stands to
reason that, if everything is sorrow, the only thing which is not sorrow
is nothing, and that therefore to escape from sorrow is the attainment
of nothingness.)<br />
Western philosophy has on occasion approached this doctrine. It has at
least asserted that no known form of existence is exempt from sorrow.
Huxley says, in his Evolution and Ethics, “Suffering is the badge of all
the tribe of sentient things.”<br />
The philosophers of this School, seeking, naturally enough, to amend the
evil at the root, inquire into the cause of this existence which is
sorrow, and arrive immediately at the “Second Noble Truth” of the
Buddha: “The Cause of Sorrow is Desire.” They follow up with the endless
concatenation of causes, of which the final root is Ignorance. (I am not
concerned to defend the logic of this School: I merely state their
doctrine.) The practical issue of all this is that every kind of action
is both unavoidable and a crime. I must digress to explain that the
confusion of thought in this doctrine is constantly recurrent. That is
part of the blackness of the Ignorance which they confess to be the
foundation of their Universe. (And after all, everyone has surely the
right to have his own Universe the way he wants it.)<br />
This School being debased by nature, is not so far removed from
conventional religion as either the White or the Yellow. Most primitive
fetishistic religions may, in fact, be considered fairly faithful
representatives of this philosophy. Where animism holds sway, the
“medicine-man” personifies this universal evil, and seeks to propitiate
it by human sacrifice. The early forms of Judaism, and that type of
Christianity which we associate with the Salvation Army, Billy Sunday
and the Fundamentalists of the back-blocks of America, are sufficiently
simple cases of religion whose essence is the propitiation of a
malignant demon.<br />
When the light of intelligence begins to dawn dimly through many fogs
upon these savages, we reach a second stage. Bold spirits master courage
to assert that the evil which is so obvious is, in some mysterious way,
an illusion. They thus throw back the whole complexity of sorrow to a
single cause; that is, the arising of the illusion aforesaid. The
problem then assumes a final form: How is that illusion to be
destroyed.<br />
A fairly pure example of the first stage of this type of thought is to
be found in the Vedas, of the second stage, in the Upanishads. But the
answer to the question, “How is the illusion of evil to be destroyed?”,
depends on another point of theory. We may postulate a Parabrahm
infinitely good, etc.<br />
etc. etc., in which case we consider the destruction of the illusion of
evil as the reuniting of the consciousness with Parabrahm. The
unfortunate part of this scheme of things is that on seeking to define
Parabrahm for the purpose of returning to Its purity, it is discovered
sooner or later, that It possesses no qualities at all! In other words,
as the farmer said, on being shown the elephant: There ain’t no sich
animile. It was Gautama Buddha who perceived the inutility of dragging
in this imaginary pachyderm. Since our Parabrahm, he said to the Hindu
philosophers, is actually nothing, why not stick to or original
perception that everything is sorrow, and admit that the only way to
escape from sorrow is to arrive at nothingness?<br />
We may complete the whole tradition of the Indian peninsula very simply.
To the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Tripitaka of the Buddhists, we
have only to add the Tantras of what are called the Vamacharya Schools.
Paradoxical as it may sound the Tantrics are in reality the most
advanced of the Hindus. Their theory is, in its philosophical ultimatum,
a primitive stage of the White tradition, for the essence of the Tantric
cults is that by the performance of certain rites of Magick, one does
not only escape disaster, but obtains positive benediction. The Tantric
is not obsessed by the will-to-die.<br />
It is a difficult business, no doubt, to get any fun out of existence;
but at least it is not impossible. In other words, he implicitly denies
the fundamental proposition that existence is sorrow, and he formulates
the essential postulate of the White School of Magick, that means exist
by which the universal sorrow (apparent indeed to all ordinary
observation) may be unmasked, even as at the initiatory rite of Isis in
the ancient days of Khem. There, a Neophyte presenting his mouth, under
compulsion, to the pouting buttocks of the Goat of Mendes, found himself
caressed by the chaste lips of a virginal priestess of that Goddess at
the base of whose shrine is written that No man has lifted her
veil.<br />
The basis of the Black philosophy is not impossibly mere climate, with
its resulting etiolation of the native, its languid, bilious, anaemic,
fever-prostrated, emasculation of the soul of man. We accordingly find
few true equivalents of this School in Europe. In Greek philosophy there
is no trace of any such doctrine. The poison in its foulest and most
virulent form only entered with Christianity.<br />
But even so, few men of any real eminence were found to take the axioms
of pessimism seriously.<br />
Huxley, for all of his harping on the minor key, was an eupeptic Tory.
The culmination of the Black philosophy is only found in Schopenhauer,
and we may regard him as having been obsessed, on the one hand, by the
despair born of that false scepticism which he learnt from the
bankruptcy of Hume and Kant; on the other, by the direct obsession of
the Buddhist documents to which he was one of the earliest Europeans to
obtain access. He was, so to speak, driven to suicide by his own vanity,
a curious parallel to Kiriloff in The Possessed of Dostoevsky.<br />
We have, however, examples plentiful enough of religions deriving almost
exclusively from the Black tradition in the different stages. We have
already mentioned the Evangelical cults with their ferocious devil-god
who creates mankind for the pleasure of damning it and forcing it to
crawl before him, while he yells with drunken glee over the agony of his
only son.+ But in the same class, we must place Christian Science, so
grotesquely afraid of pain, suffering and evil of every sort, that its
dupes can think of nothing better than to bleat denials of its
actuality, in the hope of hypnotising themselves into anaesthesia.<br />
Practically no Westerns have reached the third stage of the Black
tradition, the Buddhist stage. It is only isolated mystics, and those
men who rank themselves with a contemptuous compliance under the
standard of the nearest religion, the one which will bother them least
in their quest of nothingness, who carry the sorites so far.<br />
The documents of the Black School of Magick have already been indicated.
They are, for the most part, tedious to the last degree and repulsive to
every wholesome-minded man; yet it can hardly be denied that such books
as The Dhammapada and Ecclesiastes are masterpieces of literature. They
represent the agony of human despair at its utmost degree of intensity,
and the melancholy contemplation which is induced by their perusal is
not favourable to the inception of that mood which should lead every
truly courageous intelligence to the determination to escape from the
ferule of the Black Schoolmaster to the outstretched arms of the White
Mistress of Life.<br />
Anti-Semite writers in Europe—e.g. Weininger—call the Black theory and
practice Judaism, while by a curious confusion, the same ideas are
called Christian among Anglo-Saxons. In 1936 e.v. the “Nazi” School
began to observe this fact.<br />
† N.B. Christianity was in its first stage a Jewish Communism, hardly
distinguishable from Marxism.<br />
Let us leave the sinister figure of Schopenhauer for the mysteriously
radiant shape of Spinoza! This latter philosopher, in respect at least
of his Pantheism, represents fairly enough the fundamental thesis of the
White tradition. Almost the first observation that we have to make is
that this White tradition is hardly discoverable outside Europe. It
appears first of all in the legend of Dionysus. (In this connection read
carefully Browning’s Apollo and the Fates.)<br />
The Egyptian tradition of Osiris is not dissimilar. The central idea of
the White School is that, admitted that “everything is sorrow” for the
profane, the Initiate has the means of transforming it to “Everything is
joy.” There is no question of any ostrich-ignoring of fact, as in
Christian Science.<br />
There is not even any more or less sophisticated argument about the
point of view altering the situation as in Vedantism. We have, on the
contrary, an attitude which was perhaps first of all, historically
speaking, defined by Zoroaster, “nature teaches us, and the Oracles also
affirm, that even the evil germs of Matter may alike become useful and
good.” “Stay not on the precipice with the dross of Matter; for there is
a place for thine Image in a realm ever splendid.” “If thou extend the
Fiery Mind to the work of piety, thou wilt preserve the fluxible
body.”<br />
It appears that the Levant, from Byzantium and Athens to Damascus,
Jerusalem, Alexandria and Cairo, was preoccupied with the formulation of
this School in a popular religion, beginning in the days of Augustus
Caesar. For there are elements of this central idea in the works of the
Gnostics, in certain rituals of what Frazer conveniently calls the
Asiatic God, as in the remnants of the Ancient Egyptian cult. The
doctrine became abominably corrupted in committee, so to speak, and the
result was Christianity, which may be regarded as a White ritual
overlaid by a mountainous mass of Black doctrine, like the baby of the
mother that King Solomon non-suited.<br />
We may define the doctrine of the White School in its purity in very
simple terms.<br />
Existence is pure joy. Sorrow is caused by failure to perceive this
fact; but this is not a misfortune.<br />
We have invented sorrow, which does not matter so much after all, in
order to have the exuberant satisfaction of getting rid of it. Existence
is thus a sacrament.<br />
Adepts of the White School regard their brethren of the Black very much
as the aristocratic English Sahib (of the days when England was a
nation) regarded the benighted Hindu. Nietzsche expresses the philosophy
of this School to that extent with considerable accuracy and vigour. The
man who denounces life merely defines himself as the man who is unequal
to it. The brave man rejoices in giving and taking hard knocks, and the
brave man is joyous. The Scandinavian idea of Valhalla may be primitive,
but it is manly. A heaven of popular concert, like the Christian; of
unconscious repose, like the Buddhist; or even of sensual enjoyment,
like the Moslem, excites his nausea and contempt.<br />
He understands that the only joy worthwhile is the joy of continual
victory, and victory itself would become as tame as croquet if it were
not spiced by equally continual defeat.<br />
This passage appears to be a direct hint at the Formula of the IX°
O.T.O., and the preparation of the Elixir of Life. The purest documents
of the White School are found in the Sacred Books of Thelema. The
doctrine is given in excellent perfection both in the book of the Heart
Girt with the serpent and the book of Lapis Lazuli. A single passage is
adequate to explain the formula.<br />
7. Moreover I beheld a vision of a river. There was a little boat
thereon; and in it under purple sails was a golden woman, an image of
Asi wrought in finest gold. Also the river was of blood, and the boat of
shining steel. Then I loved her; and, loosing my girdle, cast myself
into the stream.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>I gathered myself into the little boat, and for many days and nights
did I love her, burning beautiful incense before her.<br />
</li>
<li>Yea! I gave her of the flower of my youth.<br />
</li>
<li>But she stirred not; only by my kisses I defiled her so that she
turned to blackness before me.<br />
</li>
<li>Yet I worshipped her, and gave her of the flower of my youth.<br />
</li>
<li>Also it came to pass, that thereby she sickened and corrupted before
me. Almost I cast myself into the stream.<br />
</li>
<li>Then at the end appointed her body was whiter than the milk of the
stars, and her lips red and warm as the sunset, and her life of a white
heat like the heat of the midmost sun.<br />
</li>
<li>Then rose she up from the abyss of Ages of Sleep, and her body
embraced me. Altogether I melted into her beauty and was glad.<br />
</li>
<li>The river also became the river of Amrit, and the little boat was
the chariot of the flesh, and the sails thereof the blood of the heart
that beareth me, that beareth me.<br />
Liber LXV, Cap. II.</li>
</ol>
<p>We find even in profane literature this doctrine of the White School
of Magick:- 1</p>
<p>O Buddha! couldst thou nowhere rest<br />
A pivot for the universe?<br />
Must all things be alike confessed<br />
Mere changes rung upon a curse?<br />
I swear by all the bliss of blue<br />
My Phryne with her powder on<br />
Is just as false—and just as true—<br />
As your disgusting skeleton.<br />
Each to his taste: if you prefer<br />
This loathly brooding on Decay;<br />
I call it Growth, and lovelier<br />
Than all the glamours of the day.<br />
You would not dally with Doreen<br />
Because her fairness was to fade,<br />
Because you know the things unclean<br />
That go to make a mortal maid.<br />
I, if her rotten corpse were mine,<br />
Would take it as my natural food,<br />
Denying all but the Divine<br />
Alike in evil and in good.<br />
Aspasia may skin me close,<br />
And Lais load me with disease.<br />
Poor pleasures, bitter bargains, these?<br />
I shall despise Diogenes.<br />
Follow your fancy far enough!<br />
At last you surely come to God.</p>
<p>There is thus in this School no attempt to deny that Nature is, as
Zoroaster said, “a fatal and evil force”; but Nature is, so to speak,
“the First Matter of the Work”, which is to be transmuted into
gold.<br />
The joy is a function of our own part in this alchemy. For this reason
we find the boldest and most skilful adepts deliberately seeking out the
most repugnant elements of Nature that their triumph may be the greater.
The formula is evidently one of dauntless courage. It expresses the idea
of vitality and manhood in its most dynamic sense.<br />
The only religion which corresponds to this School at all is that of
ancient Egypt; possibly also that of Chaldea. This is because those
religions are Magical religions in the strict technical sense; the
religious component of them is negligible. So far as it exists, it
exists only for the uninitiate.<br />
There are, however, traces of the beginning of the influence of the
School in Judaism and in Paganism. There are, too, certain documents of
the pure Greek spirit which bear traces of this. It is what they called
Theurgy.<br />
The Christian religion in its simplest essence, by that idea of
overcoming evil through a Magical ceremony, the Crucifixion, seems at
first sight a fair example of the White tradition; but the idea of sin
and of propitiation tainted it abominably with Blackness. There have
been, however, certain Christian thinkers who have taken the bold
logical step of regarding evil as a device of God for exercising the
joys of combat and victory. This is, of course, a perfectly White
doctrine; but it is regarded as the most dangerous of heresies. (Romans
VI. 1,2, et al.)<br />
For all that, the idea is there. The Mass itself is essentially a
typical White ritual. Its purpose is to transform crude matter directly
into Godhead. It is thus a cardinal operation of Talismanic
Magick.<br />
But the influence of the Black School has corroded the idea with
theological accretions, metaphysical on the one hand, and superstitious
on the other, so completely as to mask the Truth altogether.<br />
At the Reformation, we find a nugatory attempt to remove the Black
element. The Protestant thinkers did their best to get rid of the idea
of sin, but it was soon seen that the effort could only lead to
antinomianism; and they recognized that this would infallibly destroy
the religious idea as such.<br />
Mysticism, both Catholic and Protestant, made a further attempt to free
Christianity from the dark cloud of iniquity. They joined hands with the
Sufis and the Vedantists. But this again led to the mere denial of the
reality of evil. Thus drawing away, little by little, from clear
appreciation of the facts of Nature, their doctrine became purely
theoretical, and faded away, while the thundercloud of sin settled down
more heavily than ever.<br />
The most important of all the efforts of the White School, from an
exoteric point of view, is Islam. In its doctrine there is some slight
taint, but much less than in Christianity. It is a virile religion. It
looks facts in the face, and admits their horror; but it proposes to
overcome them by sheer dint of manhood. Unfortunately, the metaphysical
conceptions of its quasi-profane Schools are grossly materialistic. It
is only the Pantheism of the Sufis which eliminates the conception of
propitiation; and, in practice, the Sufis are too closely allied to the
Vedantists to retain hold of reality.<br />
That will be all for the present.<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-viii-the-three-schools-of-magick-3">Chapter VIII: The
Three Schools of Magick (3)</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
It has been a long—I hope not too tedious—voyage; but at last the
harbour is in sight.<br />
Our Essay approaches its goal; the theory of Life to which initiation
tends.<br />
Let us continue!<br />
There is in history only one movement whose object has been to organize
the isolated adepts of the White School of Magick, and this movement was
totally unconnected with religion, except in so far as it lent its
influence to the reformers of the Christian church. Its appeal was not
at all to the people. It merely offered to open up relations with, and
communicate certain practical secrets of wisdom to, isolated men of
science through Europe. This movement is generally known by the name of
Rosicrucianism.<br />
The word arouses all sorts of regrettable correspondences; but the
adepts of the Society have never worried themselves in the least about
the abuse of their name for the purposes of charlatanism, or about the
attacks directed against them by envious critics. Indeed, so wisely have
they concealed their activities that some modern scholars of the
shallower type have declared that no such movement ever existed, that it
was a kind of practical joke played upon the curiosity of the credulous
Middle Ages. It is at least certain that, since the original
proclamations, no official publications have been put forward. The
essential secrets have been maintained inviolate. If, during the last
few years, a considerable number of documents have been published by
them, though not in their name, it is on account of the impending crisis
to civilisation, of which mention will later be made.<br />
There is no good purpose, even were there license, to discuss the nature
of the basis of scientific attainment which is the core of the doctrines
of the Society. It is only necessary to point out that its
correspondence with alchemy is the one genuine fact on the subject which
has been allowed to transpire; for the Rosicrucian, as indicated by his
central symbol, the barren cross on which he has made a rose to flower,
occupies himself primarily with spiritual and physiological alchemy.
Taking for “The First Matter of the Work a neutral or inert substance
(it is constantly described as the commonest and least valued thing on
earth, and may actually connote any substance whatever) he deliberately
poisons it, so to speak, bringing it to a stage of transmutation
generally called the Black Dragon, and he proceeds to work upon this
virulent poison until he obtains the perfection theoretically
possible.<br />
Incidentally, we have an almost precise parallel with this operation in
modern bacteriology. The apparently harmless bacilli of a disease are
cultivated until they become a thousand times more virulent than at
first, and it is from this culture that is prepared the vaccine which is
an efficacious remedy for all the possible ravages of that kind of
microorganism.<br />
We have been obliged to expose, perhaps at too considerable a length,
the main doctrines of the three Schools. The task, however tedious, has
been necessary in order to explain with reasonable lucidity their
connection with the world which their ideas direct; that is to say, the
nature of their political activities.<br />
The Yellow School, in accordance with its doctrine of perfectly elastic
reaction and non-interference, holds itself, generally speaking,
entirely apart from all such questions. We can hardly imagine it
sufficiently interested in any events so ever to react aggressively. It
feels strong enough to deal satisfactorily with anything that may turn
up: and generally speaking, it feels that any conceivable<br />
action on its part would be likely to increase rather than to diminish
the mischief.</p>
<p>It remains somewhat contemptuously aloof from the eternal conflict of
the Black School with the White. At the same time, there is a certain
feeling among the Yellow adepts that should either of these Schools
become annihilated, the result might well be that the victor would
sooner or later turn his released energy against themselves.<br />
In accordance, therefore, with their general plan of non-action, as
expressed in the Tao Teh King, of dealing with mischief before it has
become too strong to be dangerous, they interfere gently from time to
time to redress the balance.<br />
During the last two generations the Masters of the Yellow School have
been compelled to take notice of the progressive ruin of the White
adepts. Christianity, which possessed at least the semblance of a White
formula, is in the agonies of decomposition, even before it is actually
dead. Materialistic science has overwhelmed the faith and hope of the
Christians (they never possessed any charity to overwhelm) with a
demonstration of the sorrow, transitoriness and cruel futility of the
Universe. A vast wave of pessimism has engulfed the fortress of
Mansoul.<br />
It was indeed a deadly blow to the adepts of the White School when
Science, their own familiar friend in whom they trusted, lifted up his
heel against them. It was in this conjuncture that the Yellow adepts
sent forth into the Western world a messenger, Helena Petrovna
Blavatsky, with the distinct mission to destroy, on the one hand, the
crude schools of Christianity, and, on the other, to eradicate the
materialism from Physical Science. She made the necessary connection
with Edward Maitland and Anna Kingsford, who were trying rather
helplessly to put the exoteric formulae of the White School into the
hands of students, and with the secret representatives of the
Rosicrucian Brotherhood. It is not for us in this place to estimate the
degree of success with which she carried out her embassy; but at least
we see today that Physical Science is at last penetrating to the
spiritual basis of material phenomena. The work of Henry Poincare,
Einstein, Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell is sufficient evidence of this
fact.<br />
Christianity, too, has fallen into a lower degree of contempt than ever.
Realising that it was moribund, it made a supreme and suicidal effort,
and plunged into the death-spasm of the first worldwar. It was too far
corrupt to react to the injections of the White formula which might have
saved it.<br />
We see today that Christianity is more bigoted, further divorced from
reality, than ever. In some countries it has again become a persecuting
church.<br />
With horrid glee the adepts of the Black School looked on at these
atrocious paroxysms. But it did more. It marshalled its forces quietly,
and prepared to clean up the debris of the battlefields. It is at
present (1924 e.v.) pledged to a supreme attempt to chase the manly
races from their spiritual halidom. (The spasm still [1945 e.v.]
continues; note well the pro-German screams of Anglican<br />
Bishops, and the intrigues of the Vatican.)<br />
The Black School has always worked insidiously, by treachery. We need
then not be surprised by finding that its most notable representative
was the renegade follower of Blavatsky, Annie Besant, and that she was
charged by her Black masters with the mission of persuading the world to
accept for its Teacher a negroid1 Messiah. To make the humiliation more
complete, a wretched creature was<br />
chosen who, to the most loathsome moral qualities, added the most
fatuous imbecility. And then blew up!<br />
This, then, is the present state of the war of the Three Schools. We
cannot suppose that humanity is so entirely base as to accept
Krishnamurti; yet that such a scheme could ever have been conceived is a
symptom of the almost hopeless decadence of the White School. The Black
adepts boast openly that they have triumphed all along the line. Their
formula has attained the destruction of all positive qualities. It is
only one step to the stage when the annihilation of all life and thought
will appear as a fatal necessity. The materialism and vital scepticism
of the present time, its frenzied rush for pleasure in total disregard
of any idea of building for the future, testifies to a condition of
complete moral disorder, of abject spiritual anarchy.<br />
The White School has thus been paralysed. We are reminded of the spider
described by Fabre, who injects her victims with a poison which
paralyzes them without killing them, so that her own young may find
fresh meat. And this is what is going to happen in Europe and America
unless something is done about it, and done in very short order.<br />
Note. This passage was written in 1924 e.v. The Master Therion arose and
smote him. What seemed a menace is now hardly even a memory.<br />
The Yellow School could not remain impassive spectators of the
abominations. Madame Blavatsky was a mere forerunner. They, in
conjunction with the Secret Chiefs of the White School in Europe, Chiefs
who had been compelled to suspend all attempts at exoteric enlightenment
by the general moral debility which had overtaken the races from which
they drew their adepts, have prepared a guide for mankind. This man, of
an extreme moral force and elevation, combined with a profound sense of
worldly realities, has stood forth in an attempt to save the White
School, to rehabilitate its formula, and to fling back from the bastions
of moral freedom the howling savages of pessimism.<br />
Unless his appeal is heard, unless there comes a truly virile reaction
against the creeping atrophy which is poisoning them, unless they enlist
to the last man under his standard, a great decisive battle will have
been lost.<br />
This prophet of the White School, chosen by its Masters and his
brethren, to save the Theory and Practice, is armed with a sword far
mightier than Excalibur. He has been entrusted with a new Magical
formula, one which can be accepted by the whole human race. Its adoption
will strengthen the Yellow School by giving a more positive value to
their Theory; while leaving the postulates of the Black School intact,
it will transcend them and raise their Theory and Practice almost to the
level of the Yellow. As to the White School, it will remove from them
all taint of poison of the Black, and restore vigour to their central
formula of spiritual alchemy by giving each man an independent
ideal.<br />
It will put an end to the moral castration involved in the assumption
that each man, whatever his nature, should deny himself to follow out a
fantastic and impracticable ideal of goodness.<br />
Incidentally, this formula will save Physical Science itself by making
negligible the despair of futility, the vital scepticism which has
emasculated it in the past. It shows that the joy of existence is not in
a goal, for that indeed is clearly unattainable, but in the going
itself.<br />
This law is called the Law of Thelema. It is summarised in the four
words, “Do what thou wilt.”<br />
It should not be necessary to explain that a full appreciation of this
message is not to be obtained by a hasty examination. It is essential to
study it from every point of view, to analyse it with the keenest
philosophical acumen, and finally to apply it as a key for every
problem, internal and external, that exists. This key, applied with
skill, will open every lock.<br />
From the deepest point of view, the greatest value of this formula is
that it affords, for the first time in history, a basis of
reconciliation between the three great Schools of Magick. It will tend
to appease the eternal conflict by understanding that each type of
thought shall go on its own way, develop its own proper qualities
without seeking to interfere with other formulae, however
(superficially) opposed to its own.<br />
What is true for every School is equally true for every individual.
Success in life, on the basis of the Law of Thelema, implies severe
self-discipline. Each being must progress, as biology teaches, by strict
adaptation to the conditions of the organism. If, as the Black School
continually asserts, the cause of sorrow is desire, we can still escape
the conclusion by the Law of Thelema. What is necessary is not to seek
after some fantastic ideal, utterly unsuited to our real needs, but to
discover the true nature of those needs, to fulfil them, and rejoice
therein.<br />
This process is what is really meant by initiation; that is to say, the
going into oneself, and making one’s peace, so to speak, with all the
forces that one finds there.<br />
It is forbidden here to discuss the nature of the Book of the Law, the
Sacred Scripture of Thelema.<br />
Even after forty years of close expert examination, it remains to a
great extent mysterious; but the little we know of it is enough to show
that it is a sublime synthesis of all Science and all ethics. It is by
virtue of this Book that man may attain a degree of freedom hitherto
never suspected to be possible, a spiritual development altogether
beyond anything hitherto known; and, what is really more to the point, a
control of external nature which will make the boasted achievements of
the last century appear no more than childish preliminaries to an
incomparably mighty manhood.<br />
It has been said by some that the Law of Thelema appeals only to the
élite of humanity. No doubt here is this much in that assertion, that
only the highest can take full advantage of the extraordinary
opportunities which it offers. At the same time, “the Law is for all.”
Each in his degree, every man may learn to realise the nature of his own
being, and to develop it in freedom. It is by this means that the White
School of Magick can justify its past, redeem its present, and assure
its future, by guaranteeing to every human being a life of Liberty and
of Love.<br />
Such, then, are the words of Gérard Aumont. I should not like to endorse
every phrase; but the whole exposition is so masterly in its terse,
tense vigour, and so unrivalled by any other document at my disposal,
that I thought it best to let you have it in its own original form, with
only those few alterations which lapse of time has made necessary.<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />
Fraternally,<br />
666<br />
P.S. Our own School unites the ruby red of Blood with the gold of the
Sun. It combines the best characteristics of the Yellow and the White
Schools. In the light of M. Aumont’s exposition, it is easy to
understand. To us, every phenomenon is an Act of Love, every experience
is necessary, is a Sacrament, is a means of Growth. Hence, “…existence
is pure joy;…” (AL II, 9) “A feast every day in your hearts in the joy
of my rapture! A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of
uttermost delight!” (AL II, 42-43). Let this soak in!<br />
1: Inject something about Krishnamurti here, and soften the racial
remark made above – WEH. Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986): about 1909,
while a boy in Adyar (the Indian base of the Theosophical Society), he
was “discovered” by C.W. Leadbeater, then one of the leading lights of
the Society;<br />
Leadbeater claimed that Krishnamurti was to be the “World Teacher”, a
kind of universal Messiah figure. In 1911 Leadbeater and Annie Besant
set up an organisation called “The Order of the Star in the East” as a
vehicle for Krishnamurti. The culmination of this campaign came in 1925;
about the<br />
same time Crowley issued four broadsheets (“To Man” (a.k.a. the
Mediterranean Manifesto), “The World Teacher to the Theosophical
Society,” “The Avenger to the Theosophical Society” and “Madame
Tussaud-Besant” in which he staked his own claim to World Teacherdom. In
1929 Krishnamurti disowned the Theosophists and went his own way; the
Order of the Star in the East collapsed shortly afterwards. Source for
most of this; Encyclopaedia of the Unexplained, s.v. “Krishnamurti”

<h3 id="chapter-ix-the-secret-chiefs">Chapter IX: The Secret Chiefs</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
Very glad I am, since at one time I was obliged to be starkly stern
about impertinent curiosity, to note that your wish to be informed about
the Secret Chiefs of the A.’.A.’. is justified; it is most certainly of
the first importance that you and I should be quite clear in our minds
about Those under whose jurisdiction and tutelage we both work.<br />
The question is beset with thickets of tough thorn; what is worse, the
path is so slippery that nothing is easier than to tumble head first
into the spikiest bush of them all.<br />
You justly remind me that one of my earliest slogans was “Mystery is the
enemy of Truth;” how then is it what I acquiesce in the policy of
concealment in a matter so cardinal?<br />
Perhaps the best plan is for me to set down the facts of the case, so
far as is possible, from them it may appear that no alternative policy
is feasible.<br />
The first condition of membership of the A.’.A.’. is that one is sworn
to identify one’s own Great Work with that of raising mankind to higher
levels, spiritually, and in every other way.<br />
Accordingly, it stands to reason that those charged with the conduct of
the Order should be at least Masters of the Temple, or their judgment
would be worthless, and at least Magi (though not that particular kind
of Magus who brings the Word of a New Formula to the world every 2,000
years of so) or they would be unable to influence events on any scale
commensurate with the scope of the Work.<br />
Of what nature is this Power, this Authority, this Understanding, this
Wisdom—Will?<br />
(I go up from Geburah to Chokmah.)<br />
Of the passive side it is comparatively easy to form some idea; for the
qualities essential are mainly extensions of those that all of us
possess in some degree. And whether Understanding - Wisdom is “right” or
“wrong” must be largely a matter of opinion; often Time only can decide
such points.<br />
But for the active side it is necessary to postulate the existence of a
form of Energy at their disposal which is able “to cause change to occur
in conformity with the Will”—one definition of “Magick.”<br />
Now this, as you know, is an exceedingly complex subject; its theory is
tortuous, and its practice encompassed with every kind of
difficulty.<br />
Is there no simple method?<br />
Yes: the thaumaturgic engine disposes of a type of energy more adaptable
than Electricity itself, and both stronger and subtler than this, its
analogy in the world of profane science. One might say, that it is
electrical, or at least one of the elements in the “Ring-formula” of
modern Mathematical Physics.<br />
In the R.R. et A.C., this is indicated to the Adept Minor by the title
conferred upon him on his initiation to that grade: Hodos
Camelionis:—the Path of the Chameleon. (This emphasizes the omnivalence
of the force.) In the higher degrees of O.T.O.—the A.’.A.’. is not fond
of terms like this, which verge on the picturesque—it is usually called
“the Ophidian Vibrations,” thus laying special stress upon its
serpentine strength, subtlety, its control of life and death, and its
power to insinuate itself into any desired set of circumstances.</p>
<p>It is of this universally powerful weapon that the Secret Chiefs must
be supposed to possess complete control.<br />
They can induce a girl to embroider a tapestry, or initiate a political
movement to culminate in a world-war; all in pursuit of some plan wholly
beyond the purview or the comprehension of the deepest and subtlest
thinkers.<br />
(It should go without saying that the adroit use of these vibrations
enables one to perform all the classical “miracles.”)<br />
These powers are stupendous: they seem almost beyond imagination to
conceive.<br />
“Hic ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono; Imperium sine fine
dedi.”<br />
as Vergil, that mighty seer and magician of Rome at her perihelion says
in his First Book of the Aenead. (Vergil, whose every line is also an
Oracle, the leaves of his book more sacred, more significant, more sure
than those of the Cumaean Sibyl!)<br />
These powers move in dimensions of time and space quite other than those
with which we are familiar. Their values are incomprehensible to us. To
a Secret Chief, wielding this weapon, “The nice conduct of a clouded
cane” might be infinitely more important than a war, famine and
pestilence such as might exterminate a third part of the race, to
promote whose welfare is the crux of His oath, and the sole reason of
His existence!<br />
But who are They?<br />
Since They are “invisible” and “inaccessible,” may They not merely be
figments invented by a selfstyled “Master,” not quite sure of himself,
to prop his tottering Authority?<br />
Well, the “invisible” and “inaccessible” criticism may equally be
levelled at Captain A. and Admiral B. of the Naval Intelligence
Department. These “Secret Chiefs” keep in the dark for precisely the
same reasons; and these qualities disappear instantaneously the moment
They want to get hold of you.<br />
It is written, moreover, “Let my servants be few &amp; secret: they
shall rule the many &amp; the known.” (AL I, 10)<br />
But are They then men, in the usual sense of the word? They may be
incarnate or discarnate: it is a matter of Their convenience.<br />
Have They attained Their position by passing through all the grades of
the A.’.A.’.?<br />
Yes and no: the system which was given to me to put forward is only one
of many. “Above the Abyss” all these technical wrinkles are ironed out.
One man whom I suspect of being a Secret Chief has hardly any
acquaintance with the technique of our system at all. That he accepts
The Book of the Law is almost his only link with my work. That, and his
use of the Ophidian Vibrations: I don’t know which of us is better at
it, but I am sure that he must be a very long way ahead of me if he is
one of Them.<br />
You have already in these pages and elsewhere in my writings examples
numerous and varied of the way in which They work. The list is far from
complete. The matters of Abul-Diz and of Amalantrah show one method of
communication; then there is the way of direct “inspiration,” as in the
case of “Hermes Eimi” in New Orleans.<br />
Again, They may send an ordinary living man, whether one of Themselves
or no I cannot feel sure, to instruct me in some task, or to set me
right when I have erred. Then there have been messages conveyed by
natural objects, animate or inanimate.† Needless to say, the outstanding
example in my life is the whole Plan of Campaign concerning The Book of
the Law. But is Aiwaz a man (presumably a Persian or Assyrian) and a
“Secret Chief,” or is He an “angel” in the sense that Gabriel is an
angel?<br />
Is Ab-ul-Diz an Adept who can project himself into the aura of some
woman with whom I happen to be living, although she has no previous
experience of the kind, or any interest in such matters at all?<br />
Or is He a being whose existence is altogether beyond this plane, only
adopting human appearance and faculties in order to make Himself
sensible and intelligible to that woman?<br />
I have never attempted to pursue any such enquiry. It was not forbidden;
and yet I felt that it was! I always insisted, of course, on the
strictest proof that He actually possessed the authority claimed by Him!
But I felt is improper to assume any other initiative. Just a point of
good manners, perhaps?<br />
You ask whether, contact once made, I am able to renew it should I so
wish. Again, yes and no. But the real answer is that no such gesture on
my part can ever be necessary. For one thing, the “Chief” is so far
above me that I can rely on Him to take the necessary steps, whenever
contact would be useful; for another, there is one path always open
which is perfectly sufficient for all possible contingencies.<br />
Elsewhere I will explain why they picked out so woebegone a ragamuffin
as myself to proclaim the Word of the Aeon, and do all the chores
appurtenant to that particular Work.<br />

P.S. Reading this typescript over for “literals,” it struck me that you
would ask, very reasonably: “But if the Secret Masters have these
boundless powers, why do They allow you to be plagued by printers, held
up for lack of secretaries, worried by all sorts of practical problems?
. . . Why, in a word, does anything ever go wrong?” There are several
lines of reply; coalescing, they suffice:<br />
1. What is “wrong?” Since four wars is Their idea of “right,” you may
well ask by what standard you may judge events.<br />
2. Their Work is creative; They operate on the dull mass of unrealised
possibilities. Thus they meet, firstly, the opposition of Inertia;
secondly, the recoil, the reaction, the rebound.<br />
3. Things theoretically feasible are practically impossible when (a)
desirable though their accomplishment may be, it is not the one feat
essential to the particular Work in hand and the moment; (b) the sum
total of available energy being used up by that special task, there is
none available for side-issues; (c) the opposition, passive or active,
is too strong, temporarily, to overcome.<br />
More largely, one cannot judge how a plan is progressing when one has no
precise idea what it is. A soldier is told to “attack;” he may be
intended to win through, to cover a general retreat, or to gain time by
deliberate sacrifice. Only the Commander in Chief knows what the order
means, or why he issues it; and even he does not know the issue, or
whether it will display and justify his military skill and
judgment.<br />
Our business is solely to obey orders: our responsibility ends when we
have satisfied ourselves that they emanate from a source which has the
right to command.<br />
P.P.S. A visitor’s story has just reminded me of the possibility that I
am a Secret Chief myself without knowing it: for I have sometimes been
recognised by other people as having acted as such, though I was not
aware of the fact at the time.<br />
I will remember to give you details of these incidents when the occasion
arises.<br />
† One thing I regard from my own experience as certain: when you call,
They come. The circumstances usually show that the call had been
foreseen, and preparations made to answer it, long before it was made.
But I suppose in some way the call has to justify the making.</p>

<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You actually want to know how to distinguish gold from copper
pyrites1—“fool’s gold” they called it in ‘49 California—no! I wasn’t
there— or “absolute” alcohol and—Liqueur Whisky from “alki” (commercial
alcohol—see Jack London’s The Princess, a magnificent story—don’t miss
it!) and Wartime Scotch as sold in most British pubs in 1944, era
vulgari.<br />
One pretty good plan is to take a masterpiece, pick out a page at
random, translate it into French or German or whatever language you like
best, walk around your chair three times (so as to forget the English)
and then translate it back again.<br />
You will gather a useful impression of the value of the masterpiece by
noticing the kind of difficulty that arises in the work of translation;
more, by observing the effect produced on you by reading over the
result; and finally, by estimating the re-translation; has the effect of
the original been enhanced by the work done on it? Has it become more
lucid? Has it actually given you the information which it purported to
do?<br />
(I am giving you credit for very unusual ability; this test is not easy
to make; and, obviously, you may have spoilt the whole composition,
especially where its value depends on its form rather than on its
substance. But we are not considering poetry, or poetic prose; all we
want is intelligible meaning.)<br />
It does not follow that a passage is nonsensical because you fail to
understand it; it may simply be too hard for you. When Bertrand Russell
writes “We say that a function R is ‘ultimately Q-convergent a’ if there
is a member y of the converse domain of R and the field of Q such that
the value of the function for the argument y and for any argument to
which y has the relation Q is a member of a.” Do we?<br />
But you do not doubt that if you were to learn the meaning of all these
unfamiliar terms, you would be able to follow his thought.<br />
Now take a paragraph from an “occult teacher.”<br />
What’s more, I’ll give you wheat, not tares; it seems terrifyingly easy
for sound instruction to degenerate in to a “pi-jaw.” Here goes!<br />
To don Nirmanakaya’s humble robe is to forego eternal bliss for self, to
help on man’s salvation. To reach Nirvana’s bliss but to renounce it, is
the supreme, the final step—the highest on Renunciation’s Path.2<br />
Follows a common-sense comment by Frater O.M.<br />
All this about Gautama Buddha having renounced Nirvana is apparently all
a pure invention of Mme. Blavatsky, and has no authority in the Buddhist
canon. The Buddha is referred to, again and again, as having ’passed
away by that kind of passing away which leaves nothing whatever behind.’
The account of his doing this is given in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta; and
it was the contention of the Theosophists that this ‘great, sublime
Nibbana story’ was something peculiar to Gautama Buddha.<br />
They began to talk about Parinibbana, super-Nibbana, as if there were
some way of subtracting one from one which would leave a higher,
superior kind of a nothing, or as if there were some way of blowing out
a candle which would leave Moses in a much more Egyptian darkness than
we ever supposed when we were children.<br />
This is not science. This is not business. This is American Sunday
journalism. The Hindu and the American are very much alike in this
innocence, this ‘naiveté’ which demands fairy stories with ever bigger
giants. They cannot bear the idea of anything being complete and done
with. So, they are always talking in superlatives, and are hard put to
it when the facts catch up with them, and they<br />
have to invent new superlatives. Instead of saying that there are bricks
of various sizes, and specifying those sizes, they have a brick and a
super-brick, and ‘one’ brick, and ‘some’ brick; and when they have got
to the end they chase through the dictionary for some other epithet to
brick, which shall excite the sense of wonder at the magnificent
progress and super-progress—I present the American public with this
word—which is supposed to have been made. Probably the whole thing is a
bluff without a single fact behind it. Almost the whole of the Hindu
psychology is an example of this kind of journalism. They are not
content with the supreme God. The other man wishes to show off by having
a supremer God than that, and when a third man comes along and finds
them disputing, it is up to him to invent a supremest super-God.<br />
It is simply ridiculous to try to add to the definition of Nibbana by
this invention of Parinibbana, and only talkers busy themselves with
these fantastic speculations. The serious student minds his own
business, which is the business in hand. The President of a Corporation
does not pay his bookkeeper to make a statement of the countless
billions of profit to be made in some future year. It requires no great
ability to string a row of zeros after a significant figure until the
ink runs out. What is wanted is the actual balance of the week.<br />
The reader is most strongly urged not to permit himself to indulge in
fantastic flights of thought, which are the poison of the mind, because
they represent an attempt to run away from reality, a dispersion of
energy and a corruption of moral strength. His business is, firstly, to
know himself; secondly, to order and control himself; thirdly, to
develop himself on sound organic lines little by little.<br />
The rest is only leather and prunella.<br />
There is, however, a sense in which the service of humanity is necessary
to the completeness of the Adept. He is not to fly away too far.<br />
Some remarks on this course are given in the note to the next
verse.<br />
The student is also advised to take note of the conditions of membership
of the A.’.A.’.<br />

“One day quite soon an entirely different kind of electricity will be
discovered which will bring as many profound changes into human living
as the first type did. This new electricity will move in a finer ether
than does our familiar kind, and thus will be nearer in vibration to the
fifth dimension, to the innermost source of things, that realm of
‘withinness’ wherein all is held poised by a colossal force, that same
force which is packed within the atom. Electricity number two will be
unthinkably more powerful than our present electricity number one.”

[Note by editor: In the original Manuscript the list of adjectives
contains about 1,000 words; a small selection only has been used.]<br />
Now that we are agreed upon the conditions to be satisfied if we are to
allow that a given proposition contains a Thought at all, it is proper
to turn our attention to the relative value of different kinds of
thought. This question is of the very first importance: the whole theory
of Education depends upon a correct standard. There are facts and facts:
one would not necessarily be much the wiser if one got the Encyclopaedia
Britannica by heart, or the Tables of Logarithms. The one aim of
Mathematics, in fact—Whitehead points this out in his little Shilling
Arithmetic—is to make one fact do the work of thousands.<br />
What we are looking for is a working Hierarchy of Facts.<br />
That takes us back at once to our original “addition and subtraction”
remark in my letter on Mind.<br />
Classification, the first step, proceeds by putting similar things
together, and dissimilar things apart.<br />
One asset in the Audit of a fact is the amount of knowledge which it
covers. (2 + 5)2 = 49; (3 + 4)2 = 49; (6 + 2)2 =64; (7 + 1)2 = 64; (9 +
4)2 = 169 are isolated facts, no more; worse, the coincidences of 49 and
64 might start the wildest phantasies in your head—“something mysterious
about this.” But if you write “The sum of the squares of any two numbers
is the sum of the square of each plus twice their multiple”—(a + b)2 =
a2 + b{2} + 2ab—you have got a fact which covers every possible case,
and exhibits one aspect of the nature of numbers them- selves. The
importance of a word increases as its rank, from the particular and
concrete to the general and abstract. (It is curious that the highest
values of all, the “Laws of Nature,” are never exactly “true” for any
two persons, for one person can never observe the identical phenomena
sensible to another, since two people cannot be in exactly the same
place at exactly the same time: yet it is just these facts that are
equally true for all men.)<br />
Observe, I pray, the paramount importance of memory. From one point of
view (bless your heart!) you are nothing at all but a bundle of
memories. When you say “this is happening now,” you are a falsifier of
God’s sacred truth! When I say “I see a horse”, the truth is that “I
record in those terms my private hieroglyphic interpretation of the
unknown and unknowable phenomenon (or Point-Event’) which has more or
less recently taken place at the other end of my system of receiving
impressions.”<br />
(Is this clear? I do hope so; if not, make me go on at it until it
is.)<br />
Well, then! You realise, of course, how many millions or billions of
memories there must be to compose any average well-trained mind. Those
strings of adjectives all sprang spontaneously; I did not look them up
in books of reference; so imagine the extent of my full vocabulary! And
words are but the half-baked bricks with which one constructs. Millions,
yes: billions probably: but there is a limit.<br />
See to it, then, that you accept no worthless material; that you select,
and select again, always in proper order and proportion; organise,
structuralise your thought, always with the one aim in view of
accomplishing the Great Work.<br />
Well, now, before going further into this, I must behave like an utter
cad, and disgrace my family tree, and blot my ‘escutcheon and my
copybook by confusing you about “realism.” Excuse: not my muddle; it was
made centuries ago by a gang of curséd monks, headed by one Duns
Scotus—socalled because he was Irish—or if not by somebody else equally
objectionable. They held to the Platonic dogma of archetypes. They
maintained that there was an original (divine) idea such as “greenness”
or a “pig,” and that a green pig, as observed in nature, was just one
example of these two ideal essences. They were opposed by the
“nominalists,” who said, to the contrary, that “greenness” or “a pig”
were nothing in themselves; they were mere names (nominalism from Lat.
nomen, a name) invented for convenience of grouping. This doctrine is
plain common sense, and I shall waste no time in demolishing the
realists.<br />
All à priori thinking, the worst kind of thinking, goes with “realism”
in this sense.<br />
And now you look shocked and surprised! And no wonder! What (you
exclaim) is the whole Qabalistic doctrine but the very apotheosis of
this “realism”? (It was also called “idealism”, apparently to cheer and
comfort the student on his rough and rugged road!) Is not Atziluth the
“archetypal world?” is not—Oh, all right, all right! Keep your blouse
on! I didn’t go for to do it. You’re quite right:<br />
the Tree of Life is like that, in appearance. But that is the wrong way
to look at it. We get our number two, for example, as “that which is
common to a bird’s legs, a man’s ears, twins, the cube root of eight,
the greater luminaries, the spikes of a pitchfork,” etc. but, having got
it, we must not go on to argue that the number two being possessed of
this and that property, therefore there must be two of something or
other which for one reason or another we cannot count on our
fingers.<br />
The trouble is that sometimes we can do so; we are very often obliged to
do so, and it comes out correct. But we must not trust any such theorem;
it is little more than a hint to help us in our guesses. Example: an
angel appears and tells us that his name is MALIEL (MLIAL) which adds to
111, the third of the numbers of the Sun. Do we conclude that his nature
is solar? In this case, yes, perhaps, because (on the theory) he took
that name for the very reason that it chimed with his nature. But a man
may reside at 81 Silver Street without being a lunatic, or be born at
five o’clock on the 5th of May, 1905, and make a very poor
soldier.<br />
“No, no, my dear sister, how tempted soever, To nominalism be faithful
forever!”<br />
(If you want to be very learned indeed, read up Bertrand Russell on
“Classes.”)<br />
Enough, more than enough, of this: let us return to the relative value
of various types of thought.<br />
I think you already understand the main point: you must structuralise
your thinking. You must learn how to differentiate and how to integrate
your thoughts. Nothing exists in isolation; it is always conditioned by
its relations with other things; indeed, in one sense, a thing is no
more than the sum of these relations. (For the only “reality,” in the
long run, is, as we have seen, a Point of View.)<br />
Now, this task of organizing the mind, of erecting a coherent and
intelligible structure, is enormously facilitated by the Qabalah.<br />
When, in one of those curious fits of indisposition of which you
periodically complain, and of which the cause appears to you so obscure,
you see pink leopards on the staircase, mmmmm “Ah! the colour of the
King Scale of Tiphareth—Oh! the form of Leo, probably in the Queen
Scale” and thereby increase your vocabulary by these two items. Then,
perhaps, someone suggests that indiscretion in the worship of Dionysus
is responsible for the observed phenomena—well, there’s Tiphareth again
at once; the Priest, moreover, wears a leopard-skin, and the spots
suggest the Sun. Also, Sol is Lord of Leo: so there you are! pink
leopards are exactly what you have a right to expect!<br />
Until you have practiced this method, all day and every day, for quite a
long while, you cannot tell how amazingly your mnemonic power increases
by virtue thereof. But be careful always to range the new ideas as they
come along in their right order of importance.<br />
It is not unlike the system of keys used in big establishments, such as
hotels. First, a set of keys, each of which opens one door, and one door
only. Then, a set which opens all the doors on one floor only. And so
on, until the one responsible person who has one unique key which opens
every lock in the building.<br />
There is another point about this while System of the Qabalah. It does
more than merely increase the mnemonic faculty by 10,000% or so; the
habit of throwing your thoughts about, manipulating them, giving them a
wash and brush-up, packing them away into their proper places in you
“Crystal Cabinet,” gives you immensely increased power over them.<br />
In particular, it helps you to rid them of the emotional dirt which
normally clogs them, you become perfectly indifferent to any implication
but their value in respect of the whole system; and this of incalculable
help in the acquisition of new ideas. It is the difference between a man
trying to pick a<br />
smut out of his wife’s eye with clumsy, greasy fingers coarsened by
digging drains, and an occultist furnished with a speculum and all the
instruments exactly suited to the task.<br />
Yet another point. Besides getting rid of the emotions and sensations
which cloud the thought, the fact that you are constantly asking
yourself “Now, in which drawer of which cabinet does this thought go?”
automatically induces you to regard the system as the important factor
in the operation, if only because it is common to every one of
them.<br />
So not only have you freed Sanna (perception) from the taint of Vedana
(sensation) but raised it (or demolished it, if your prefer to look at
it in that light!) to be merely a member of the Sankhâra (tendency)
class, thus boosting you vigorously to the fourth stage, the last before
the last! of the practice of Mahasatipathana.<br />
Just one more word about the element of Vedana. The Intellect is a
purely mechanical contrivance, as accurate and as careless of what it
turns out as a Cash Register. It receives impressions, calculates,
states the result: that is A double L, ALL!<br />
Try never to qualify a thought in any way, to see it as it is in itself
in relation to those other elements which are necessary to make it what
it is.<br />
Above all, do not “mix the planes.” A dagger may be sharp or blunt,
straight or crooked; it is not “wicked-looking,” or even “trusty,”
except in so far as the quality of its steel makes it so. A cliff is not
“frowning” or “menacing.” A snow-covered glacier is not “treacherous:”
to say so means only that Alpine Clubmen and other persons ignorant of
mountain craft are unable to detect the position of<br />
covered crevasses.<br />
All such points you must decide for yourself; the important thing is
that you should challenge any such ideas.<br />
Above all, do not avoid, or slur, unwelcome trains of thought or
distressing problems. Don’t say “he passed on” when you mean “he died,”
and don’t call a spade a bloody shovel!<br />
Thresh out such matters with Osiris’ flail; on the winnowing-fan of
Iacchus!<br />
Truth in itself is beautiful, and the best bower-anchor of your ship;
every truth fits all the rest of truth; and the most alluring lies will
never do that.<br />
“The toad, ugly and venomous,<br />
Wears yet a precious jewel in its head.”<br />
and the result of letting<br />
“Two ghastly scullions concoct mess<br />
With brimstone, pitch, vitriol, and devil’s dung.”<br />
in the end repay investigation.<br />
The vision and the Voice again, please! That frightful Curse—how every
phrase turns out to be a Blessing!6<br />
I shall break off this brief note at this point, so that you may have
time to tell me if what I have so far said covers the whole ground of
your enquiry.<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />

I hope there is no need to repeat that whether any given thought is
pleasant, or undesirable, or otherwise soiled by Vedana, is totally
irrelevant.<br />

The Left-Hand Path—“The Black Brothers”</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
It is the introduction of the word “self” that has raised such prickly
questions. It really is a little bewildering; the signpost “Right-hand
Path”, “Left-hand Path”, seems rather indecipherable; and then, for such
a long way, they look exactly alike. At what point do they
diverge?<br />
Actually, the answers are fairly simple.<br />
As far as the achievement or attainment is concerned, the two Paths are
in fact identical. In fact, one almost feels obliged to postulate some
inmost falsity, completely impossible to detect, inherent at the very
earliest stages.<br />
For the decision which determines the catastrophe confronts only the
Adeptus Exemptus 7° = 4°.<br />
Until that grade is reached, and that very fully indeed, with all the
buttons properly sewed on, one is not capable of understanding what is
meant by the Abyss. Unless “all you have and all you are” is identical
with the Universe, its annihilation would leave a surplus.<br />
Mark well this first distinction: the “Black Magician” or Sorcerer is
hardly even a distant cousin of the “Black Brother.” The difference
between a sneak-thief and a Hitler is not too bad an analogy.<br />
The Sorcerer may be—indeed he usually is—a thwarted disappointed man
whose aims are perfectly natural. Often enough, his real trouble is
ignorance; and by the time he has become fairly hot stuff as a Black
Magician, he has learnt that he is getting nowhere, and finds himself,
despite himself, on the True Path of the Wise.<br />
“Invoking Zeus to swell the power of Pan, The prayer discomfits the
demented man; Lust lies as still as Love.”<br />
Thereupon he casts away his warlock apparatus like a good little boy,
finds the A.’.A.’., and lives happily ever after.<br />
The Left-hand Path is a totally different matter. Let us start at the
beginning.<br />
You remember my saying that only two operations were possible in Nature:
addition and subtraction.<br />
Let us apply this to magical progress.<br />
What happens when the Aspirant invokes Diana, or calls up Lilith? He
increases the sum of his experiences in these particular ways. Sometimes
he has a “liaison-experience,” which links two main lines of thought,
and so is worth dozens of isolated gains.<br />
Now, if there is any difference at all between the White and the Black
Adept in similar case, it is that the one, working by “love under will”
achieves a marriage with the new idea, while the other, merely grabbing,
adds a concubine to his harem of slaves.<br />
The about-to-be-Black Brother constantly restricts himself; he is
satisfied with a very limited ideal; he is afraid of losing his
individuality—reminds one of the “Nordic” twaddle about
“race-pollution.”<br />
Have you seen the sand-roses of the Sahara? Such is the violence of the
Khamsin that it whips grains of sand together, presses them, finally
builds them into great blocks, big enough and solid enough to be used
for walls in the oasis. And beautiful! Whew! For all that, they are not
real rocks. Leave them in peace, with no possible interference—what
happens? (I brought some home, and put them “in safety” as curiosities,
and as useful psychometrical tests.) Alas! Time is enough. Go to the
drawer which held them; nothing remains but little piles of dust.<br />
“Now Master!” (What reproach in the tone of your voice!) All right, all
right! Keep your hair on!—I know that is the precise term used in The
Vision and the Voice, to describe the Great White Brother or the Babe of
the Abyss; but to him it means victory; to the Left-Hander it would mean
defeat, ruin devastating, irremediable, final. It is exactly that which
he most dreads; and it is that to which he must in the end come, because
there is no compensating element in his idea of structure. Nations
themselves never grow permanently by smash-and-grab methods; one merely
acquires a sore spot, as in the case of Lorraine, perhaps even Eire.
(Though Eire is using just that formula of Restriction, shutting herself
up in her misery and poverty and idiot pride, when a real marriage with
and dissolution in, a real live country would give her new life. The
“melting-pot” idea is the great strength of America.)<br />
Consider the Faubourg St. Germain aristocracy—now hardly even a
sentimental memory. The guillotine did not kill them; it was their own
refusal to adapt themselves to the new biological conditions of
political life. It was indeed their restriction that rotted them in the
first instance; had Lafayette or Mirabeau been trusted with full power,
and supplied with adequate material, a younger generation of virtue, the
monarchy might still be ruling France. But then (you ask) how can a man
go so far wrong after he has, as an Adeptus Minor, attained the
“Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel”?<br />
Recall the passage in the 14th Aethyr “See where thine Angel hath led
Thee”, and so on. Perhaps the Black Brother deserts his Angel when he
realises the Programme.<br />
Perhaps his error was so deeply rooted, from the very beginning, that it
was his Evil Genius that he evoked.<br />
In such cases the man’s policy is of course to break off all relations
with the Supernal Triad, and to replace it by inventing a false crown,
Daäth. To them Knowledge will be everything, and what is Knowledge but
the very soul of Illusion?<br />
Refusing thus the true nourishment of all his faculties, they lose their
structural unity, and must be fortified by continuous doses of dope in
anguished self-preservation. Thus all its chemical equations become
endothermic.<br />
I do hope I am making myself clear; it is a dreadfully subtle line of
thought. But I think you ought to be able to pick up the essential
theorem; your own meditations, aided by the relevant passages in Liber
418 and elsewhere, should do the rest.<br />
To describe the alternative attitude should clarify, by dint of
contrast; at least the contemplation should be a pleasant change.<br />
Every accretion must modify me. I want it to do so. I want to assimilate
it absolutely. I want to make it a permanent feature of my Temple. I am
not afraid of losing myself to it, if only because it also is modified
by myself in the act of union. I am not afraid of its being the “wrong”
thing, because every experience is a “play of Nuit,” and the worst that
can happen is a temporary loss of balance, which is instantly adjusted,
as soon as it is noticed, by recalling and putting into action the
formula of contradiction.<br />
Remember the Fama Fraternitatis: when they opened the Vault which held
the Pastos of our Father Christian Rosenkreuz, “all these colours were
brilliant and flashing.” That is, if one panel measured 10” x 40”, the
symbol (say, yellow) would occupy 200 square inches, and the background
(in that<br />
case, violet) the other 200 square inches. Hence they dazzled; the
limitation, restriction, demarcation, disappeared; and the result was an
equable idea of form and colour which is beyond physical understanding.
(At one time Picasso tried to work out this idea on canvas.) Destroy
that equilibrium by one ten-millionth of an inch, and the effect is
lost. The unbalanced item stands out like a civilian in the middle of a
regiment.<br />
True, this faculty, this feeling for equilibrium must be acquired; but
once you have done so, it is an unerring guide. Instant discomfort warns
one; the impulse to scratch it (the analogy is too apt to reject!) is
irresistible.<br />
And oh! how imperative this is!<br />
Unless your Universe is perfect—and perfection includes the idea of
balance—how can you come even to Atmadarshana? Hindus may maintain that
Atmadarshana, or at any rate Shivadarshana, is the equivalent of
crossing the Abyss. Beware of any such conclusions! The Trances are
simply isolated experiences, sharply cut off from normal thought-life.
To cross the Abyss is a permanent and fundamental revolution in the
whole of one’s being.<br />
Much more, upon the brink of the Abyss. If there be missing or redundant
even one atom, the entire monstrous, the portentous mass must tend to
move with irresistible impact, in such direction as to restore the
equilibrium. To deflect it—well, think of a gyroscope! How then can you
destroy it in one sole stupendous gesture? Ah! Listen to The Vision and
the Voice.<br />
Perhaps the best and simplest plan is for me to pick out the most
important of the relevant passages and put them together as an appendix
to this letter. Also, by contrast, those allusions to the “Black
Brothers” and the “Left-hand Path.” This ought to give you a clear idea
of what each is, and does; of what distinguishes their respective
methods in some ways so confusingly alike. I hope indeed most sincerely
that you will whet your Magical Dagger on the Stone of the Wise, and
wield most deftly and determinedly both the White-handled and the
Black-handled Burin. In trying to express these opinions, I am
constantly haunted by the dread that I may be missing some crucial
point, or even allowing a mere quibble to pass for argument. It makes it
only all the worse when one has become so habituated by Neschamic ideas,
to knowing, even before one says it, that what one is going to say is of
necessity untrue, as untrue as it is contradictory. So what can it
possibly matter what one says?<br />
Such doubts are dampers!<br />
“Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!”<br />
Here follow the quotations from The Vision and the Voice.<br />
The Angel re-appears.<br />
The blackness gathers about, so thick, so clinging, so penetrating, so
oppressive, that all the other darkness that I have ever conceived would
be like bright light beside it.<br />
His voice comes in a whisper: O thou that art master of the fifty gates
of Understanding, is not my mother a black woman? O thou that art master
of the Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg?<br />
Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who
am the sole light, a spark shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and
Typhon.<br />
I am the snake that devoureth the spirit of man with the lust of light.
I am the sightless storm in the night that wrappeth the world about with
desolation. Chaos is my name, and thick darkness. Know thou that the
darkness of the earth is ruddy, and the darkness of the air is grey, but
the darkness of the soul is utter blackness.<br />
The egg of the spirit is a basilisk egg, and the gates of the
understanding are fifty, that is the sign of the Scorpion. The pillars
about the Neophyte are crowned with flame, and the vault of the Adepts
is lighted by the Rose. And in the abyss is the eye of the hawk. But
upon the great sea shall the Master of the Temple find neither star nor
moon.<br />
And I was about to answer him: “The light is within me.” But before I
could frame the words, he answered me with the great word that is the
Key of the Abyss. And he said: Thou hast entered the night; dost thou
yet lust for day? Sorrow is my name and affliction. I am girt about with
tribulation.<br />
Here still hangs the Crucified One, and here the Mother weeps over the
children that she hath not borne. Sterility is my name and desolation.
Intolerable is thine ache, and incurable thy wound. I said, ‘Let the
darkness cover me;’ and behold, I am compassed about with the blackness
that hath no name. O thou, who hast cast down the light into the earth,
so must thou do for ever. And the light of the sun shall not shine upon
thee and the moon shall not lend thee of her lustre, and the stars shall
be hidden because thou art passed beyond these things, beyond the need
of these things, beyond the desire of these things.<br />
What I thought were shapes of rocks, rather felt than seen, now appear
to be veiled Masters, sitting absolutely still and silent. Nor can
anyone be distinguished from the others.<br />
And the Angel sayeth: Behold where thine Angel hath led thee! Thou didst
ask fame, power and pleasure, health and wealth and love, and strength
and length of days. Thou didst hold life with eight tentacles, like an
octopus. Thou didst seek the four powers and the seven delights and the
twelve emancipations, and the two and twenty Privileges and the nine and
forty Manifestations, and lo! thou art become as one of These. Bowed are
their backs, whereon resteth the Universe. Veiled are their faces, that
have beheld the glory Ineffable.<br />
These adepts seem like Pyramids—their hoods and robes are like
Pyramids.<br />
And the Angel sayeth: Verily is the Pyramid a Temple of Initiation.
Verily also is it a tomb. Thinkest thou that there is life within the
Masters of the Temple that sit hooded, encamped upon the Sea?<br />
Verily, there is no life in them.<br />
Their sandals were the pure light, and they have taken them from their
feet and cast them down through the abyss; for this Aethyr is holy
ground.<br />
Herein no forms appear, and the vision of God face to face, that is
transmuted in the Athanor called dissolution, or hammered into one in
the forge of meditation, is in this place but a blasphemy and a
mockery.<br />
And the Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is no
more. There is no more knowledge. There is no more bliss. There is no
more power. There is no more beauty. For this is the Palace of
Understanding; for thou art one with the Primeval things.<br />
Drink in the myrrh of my speech that is bruised with the gall of the
roc, and dissolved in the ink of the cuttlefish, and perfumed with the
deadly nightshade.<br />
This is thy wine, who wast drunk upon the wine of Iacchus. And for bread
shalt thou eat salt, O thou on the corn of Ceres that didst wax fat! For
as pure being is pure nothing, so is pure wisdom pure — and so is pure
understanding silence, and stillness, and darkness. The eye is called
seventy, and the triple Aleph whereby thou perceivest it, divideth into
the number of the terrible word that is the Key of the Abyss.<br />
I am Hermes, that am sent from the Father to expound all things
discreetly in these the last words that thou shalt hear before thou take
thy seat among these, whose eyes are sealed up and whose ears are
stopped, and whose mouths are clenched, who are folded in upon
themselves, the liquor of whose bodies is dried up, so that nothing
remains but a little pyramid of dust.<br />
And that bright light of comfort, and that piercing sword of truth, and
all the power and beauty that they have made of themselves, is cast from
them, as it is written, “I saw Satan like lightning fall from heaven.”
And as a flaming sword is it dropped though the Abyss, where the four
beasts keep watch and ward. And it appeareth in the heaven of Jupiter as
a morning star, or as an evening star. And the light thereof shineth
even unto the earth, and bringeth hope and help to them that dwell in
the darkness of thought, and drink of the poison of life. Fifty are the
gates of Understanding, and one hundred and six are the seasons thereof.
And the name of every season is Death.<br />
(The Vision and the Voice. 14th Æthyr.)<br />
And for his Work thereafter?<br />
So we enter the earth, and there is a veiled figure, in absolute
darkness. Yet it is perfectly possible to see in it, so that the
minutest details do not escape us. And upon the root of one flower he
pours acid so that the root writhes as if in torture. And another he
cuts, and the shriek is like the shriek of a Mandrake, torn up by the
roots. And another he sears with fire, and yet another he anoints with
oil.<br />
And I said: Heavy is the labour, but great indeed is the reward.<br />
And the young man answered me: He shall not see the reward; he tendeth
the garden.<br />
And I said: What shall come unto him?<br />
And he said: This thou canst not know, nor is it revealed by the letters
that are the totems of the stars, but only by the stars.<br />
And he says to me, quite disconnectedly: The man of earth is the
adherent. The lover giveth his life unto the work among men. The hermit
goeth solitary, and giveth only of his light unto men.<br />
And I ask him: Why does he tell me that?<br />
And he says: I tell thee not. Thou tellest thyself, for thou hast
pondered thereupon for many days, and hast not found light. And now that
thou art called NEMO, the answer to every riddle that thou hast not
found shall spring up in thy mind, unsought. Who can tell upon what day
a flower shall bloom?<br />
And thou shalt give thy wisdom unto the world, and that shall be thy
garden. And concerning time and death, thou hast naught to do with these
things. For though a precious stone be hidden in the sand of the desert
it shall not heed for the wind of the desert, although it be but sand.
For the worker of works hath worked thereupon; and because it is clear,
it is invisible; and because it is hard, it moveth not.<br />
All these words are heard by everyone that is called NEMO. And with that
doth he apply himself to understanding. And he must understand the
virtue of the waters of death, and he must understand the virtue of the
sun and of the wind, and of the worm that turneth the earth, and of the
stars that roof in the garden. And he must understand the separate
nature and property of every flower, or how shall he tend his
garden?<br />
(Ibid. 13th Æthyr.)<br />
Thus for the Masters of the Temple; for the Black Brothers, how?<br />
For Choronzon is as it were the shell or excrement of these three paths,
and therefore is his head raised unto Daäth, and therefore have the
Black Brotherhood declared him to be the child of Wisdom and
Understanding, who is but the bastard of the Swastika. And this is that
which is written in the Holy Qabalah, concerning the Whirlpool and
Leviathan, and the Great Stone.<br />
(Ibid. 3rd Æthyr)<br />
Moreover, there is Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON, for she hath shut
herself up; and therefore is she the Queen of all those wicked devils
that walk upon the earth, those that thou sawest even as little black
specks that stained the Heaven of Urania. And all these are the
excrement of Choronzon.<br />
And for this is BABALON under the power of the Magician, that she hath
submitted herself unto the work; and she guardeth the Abyss. And in her
is a perfect purity of that which is above, yet she is sent as the
Redeemer to them that are below. For there is no other way into the
Supernal mystery but through her and the Beast on which she rideth; and
the Magician is set beyond her to deceive the brothers of blackness,
lest they should make unto themselves a crown; for it there were two
crowns, then should Ygdrasil, that ancient tree, be cast out into the
Abyss, uprooted and cast down into the Outermost Abyss, and the Arcanum
which is in the Adytum should be profaned; and the Ark should be
touched, and the Lodge spied upon by them that are not masters, and the
bread of the Sacrament should be the dung of Choronzon; and the wine of
the Sacrament should be the water of Choronzon; and the incense should
be dispersion; and the fire upon the Altar should be hate. But lift up
thyself; stand, play the man, for behold! there shall be revealed unto
thee the Great Terror, the thing of awe that hath no name.<br />
(Ibid. 3rd Æthyr)<br />
And now She cometh forth again, riding upon a dolphin. Now again I see
those wandering souls, that have sought restricted love, and have not
understood that the “word of sin is restriction.”<br />
It is very curious; they seem to be looking for one another, or for
something, all the time, constantly hurrying about. But they knock up
against one another and yet will not see one another, or cannot see one
another, because they are so shut up in their cloaks.<br />
And a voice sounds: It is most terrible for the one that hath shut
himself up and made himself fast against the universe. For they that sit
encamped upon the sea in the city of the Pyramids are indeed shut up.
But they have given their blood, even to the last drop, to fill the cup
of BABALON.<br />
These that thou seest are indeed the Black Brothers, for it is written:
He shall laugh at their calamity and mock when their fear cometh. And
therefore hath he exalted them unto the plane of love.<br />
And yet again it is written: He desireth not the death of a sinner, but
rather that he should turn from his wickedness. Now, if one of these
were to cast off his cloak he should behold the brilliance of the lady
of the Aethyr; but they will not.<br />
And again:—<br />
Oh, I see vast plains beneath her feet, enormous deserts studded with
great rocks; and I see little lonely souls, running helplessly about,
minute black creatures like men. And they keep up a very curious
howling, that I can compare to nothing that I have ever heard; yet it is
strangely human.<br />
And the voice says: These are they that grasped love and clung thereto,
praying ever at the knees of the great goddess. These are they that have
shut themselves up in fortresses of Love.<br />
(Ibid. 7th Æthyr.)<br />
Moreover, this also:<br />
And this is the meaning of the Supper of the Passover, the spilling of
the blood of the Lamb being a ritual of the Dark Brothers, for they have
sealed up the Pylon with blood, lest the Angel of Death should enter
therein. Thus do they shut themselves off from the company of the
saints. Thus do they keep themselves from compassion and from
understanding. Accursed are they, for they shut up their blood in their
heart.<br />
They keep themselves from the kisses of my Mother Babylon, and in their
lonely fortresses they pray to the false moon. And they bind themselves
together with an oath, and with a great curse. And of their malice they
conspire together, and they have power, and mastery, and in their
cauldrons do they brew the harsh wine of delusion, mingled with the
poison of their selfishness.<br />
Thus they make war upon the Holy one, sending forth their delusion upon
men, and upon everything that liveth. So that their false compassion is
called compassion, and their false understanding is called
understanding, for this is their most potent spell.<br />
Yet of their own poison do they perish, and in their lonely fortresses
shall they be eaten up by Time that hath cheated them to serve him, and
by the mighty devil Choronzon, their master, whose name is the second
Death, for the blood that they have sprinkled on their Pylon, that is a
bar against the Angel Death, is the key by which he entereth in.+<br />
(Ibid. 12th Æthyr.)<br />
Finally:<br />
Yet must he that understandeth go forth unto the outermost Abyss, and
there must he speak with him that is set above the four-fold terror, the
Prince of Evil, even with Choronzon, the mighty devil that inhabiteth
the outermost Abyss. And none may speak with him, or understand him, but
the servants of Babylon, that understand, and they that are without
understanding, his servants.<br />
Behold! it entereth not into the heart, nor into the mind of man to
conceive this matter; for the sickness of the body is death, and the
sickness of the heart is despair, and the sickness of the mind is
madness. But in the outermost Abyss is sickness of the aspiration, and
sickness of the will, and sickness of the essence of all, and there is
neither word nor thought wherein the image of its image is
reflected.<br />
And whoso passeth into the outermost Abyss, except he be of them that
understand, holdeth out his hands, and boweth his neck, unto the Chains
of Choronzon. And as a devil he walketh about the earth, immortal, and
be blasteth the flowers of the earth, and he corrupteth the fresh air,
and he maketh poisonous the water; and the fire that is the friend of
man, and the pledge of his aspiration, seeing that it mounteth ever
upward as a Pyramid, and seeing that man stole it in a hollow tube from
Heaven, even that fire he turneth into ruin, and madness, and fever, and
destruction. And thou, that art an heap of dry dust in the city of the
Pyramids, must understand these things.<br />
Beware, therefore, O thou who art appointed to understand the secret of
the Outermost Abyss, for in every Abyss thou must assume the mask and
form of the Angel thereof. Hadst thou a name, thou wert irrevocably
lost. Search, therefore, if there be yet one drop of blood that is not
gathered into the cup of Babylon the Beautiful: for in that little pile
of dust, if there could be one drop of blood, it should be utterly
corrupt; it should breed scorpions, and vipers, and the cat of slime.
And I said unto the Angel: “Is there not one appointed as a warden?” And
he said: Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani. Such an ecstasy of anguish racks
me that I cannot give it voice, yet I know it is but as the anguish of
Gethsemane.<br />
(Ibid. 7th Æthyr.)<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />

substitute the blood of someone else<br />

Chapter XIII: System of the<br />
O.T.O.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-xiii-system-of-the-o.t.o.">Chapter XIII: System of the
O.T.O.</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
You inform me that the Earnest Inquirer of your ambit has been asking
you to explain the difference between the A.’.A.’. and the O.T.O.; and
that although your own mind is perfectly clear about it, you find it
impossible to induce a similar lucidity in his. You add that he is not
(as one might at first suppose) a moron. And will I please do what I can
about it?<br />
Well, here’s the essential difference ab ovo usque ad mala; the A.’.A.’.
concerns the individual, his development, his initiation, his passage
from “Student” to “Ipsissimus”; he has no contact of any kind with any
other person except the Neophyte who introduces him, and any Student or
Students whom he may, after becoming a Neophyte, introduce.<br />
The details of this Pilgrim’s Progress are very fully set forth in One
Star in Sight; and I should indeed be stupid and presumptuous to try to
do better than that. But it is true that with regard to the O.T.O. there
is no similar manual of instruction. In the Manifesto, and other
Official Pronunciamenti, there are, it is true, what ought to be
adequate data; but I quite understand that they are not as ordered and
classified as one would wish; there is certainly room for a simple
elementary account of the origins of the Order, of its principles, of
its methods, of its design, of the Virtue of its successive Grades. This
I will now try to supply, at least in a brief outline.<br />
Let us begin at the beginning. What is a Dramatic Ritual? It is a
celebration of the Adventures of the God whom it is intended to invoke.
(The Bacchae of Euripides is a perfect example of this.) Now, in the
O.T.O., the object of the ceremonies being the Initiation of the
Candidate, it is he whose Path in Eternity is displayed in dramatic
form.<br />
What is the Path?<br />
1. The Ego is attracted to the Solar System.<br />
2. The Child experiences Birth.<br />
3. The Man experiences Life.<br />
4. He experiences Death.<br />
5. He experiences the World beyond Death.<br />
6. This entire cycle of Point-Events is withdrawn into Annihilation.</p>
<p>In the O.T.O. these successive stages are represented as
follows:—</p>
<p>1 0° (Minerval)<br />
2 I° (Initiation)<br />
3 II° (Consecration)<br />
4 III° (Devotion)<br />
5 IV° (Perfection, or Exaltation)<br />
6 P.I. (Perfect Initiate)</p>
<p>Of these Events of Stations upon the Path all but 3 (II°) are single
critical experiences. We, however, are concerned mostly with the very
varied experiences of Life.<br />
All subsequent Degrees of the O.T.O. are accordingly elaborations of the
IIø, since in a single ceremony it is hardly possible to sketch, even in
the briefest outline, the Teaching of Initiates with regard to Life. The
Rituals V°–IX° are then instructions to the Candidate how he should
conduct himself; and they confer upon him, gradually, the Magical
Secrets which make him Master of Life.<br />
It is improper to disclose the nature of these ceremonies; firstly,
because their Initiates are bound by the strictest vows not to do so;
secondly, because surprise is an element in their efficacy; and thirdly,
because the Magical Formulae explicitly or implicitly contained therein
are, from a practical point of view, both powerful and dangerous.
Automatic safeguards there are, it is true; but a Black Magician of
first- class ability might find a way to overcome these obstacles, and
work great mischief upon others before the inevitable recoil of his
artillery destroys him.<br />
Such cases I have known. Let me recount briefly one rather conspicuous
disaster. The young man was a genius—and it was his bane. He got hold of
a talisman of enormous power which happened to be exactly what he wanted
to fulfil his heart’s dearest wish. He knew also the correct way of
getting it to work; but this way seemed to him far too long and
difficult. So he cast about for a short cut. By using actual violence to
the talisman, he saw how he could force it to carry out his design; he
used a formula entirely alien to the spirit of the whole operation; it
was rather like extracting information from a prisoner by torture, when
patient courtesy would have been the proper method. So he crashed the
gate and got what he wanted. But the nectar turned to poison even as he
drained the cup, and his previous anguish developed into absolute
despair. Then came the return of the current, and they brought it in
“while of unsound mind.” A most accurate diagnosis!<br />
I do beg you to mark well, dear sister, that a true Magical Operation is
never “against Nature.” It must go smoothly and serenely according to
Her laws. One can bring in alien energies and compel an endothermic
reaction; but—“Pike’s Peak or bust?” The answer will always be
BUST!<br />
To return for a moment to that question of Secrecy: there is no rule to
prohibit you from quoting against me such of my brighter remarks as
“Mystery is the enemy of Truth;” but, for one thing, I am, and always
have been, the leader of the Extreme Left in the Council-Chamber of the
City of the Pyramids, so that if I acquiesce at all in the system of the
O.T.O. so far as the “secret of secrets” of the IX° is concerned, it is
really on a point of personal honour. My pledge given to the late Frater
Superior and O.H.O., Dr Theodor Reuss. For all that, in this particular
instance it is beyond question a point of common prudence, both because
the abuse of the Secret is, at least on the surface, so easy and so
tempting, and because, if it became a matter of general knowledge the
Order itself might be in danger of calumny and persecution; for the
secret is even easier to misinterpret that to profane.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-xiv-noise">Chapter XIV: Noise</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
You ask me what is, at the present time, the greatest obstacle to human
progress.<br />
I answer in one word: NOISE.<br />
You will recall that in Yoga the concise compendium of Initiated
Instruction is:</p>
<p>Sit still<br />
Stop thinking<br />
Shut up, and<br />
Get out.</p>
<p>The second of these postulates the third; for one can neither think
nor stop thinking with all that row going on.<br />
Then again, the Fourth Power of the Sphinx is Silence; on this subject I
must refer you to Little Essays Toward Truth (No. 14, p. 75).<br />
We are really trying to discuss something totally different; something
practical in daily life. Very well, then; you remark that Goetia
actually means “howling”, that we use officially the Bell, the Tom-Tom,
the Incantations, the Mantras and so on. All quite true, about Magick;
but none of it applies to Yoga, for even with the Mantra the practice is
to go faster and more quietly as one proceeds, until it becomes “Mental
Muttering.” M is the letter that is pronounced with the lips firmly
closed; and Silence is the meaning of the MU root of Mystery.<br />
However, we must admit the value of rhythmical, one-pointed sound; that
is very different from Noise. Old French has noise, nose, a debate,
quarrel, noise; Provençal noisa, nausa, nueiza. But Diez claims the
derivation from nausea—and by the Living Jingo, I consider Diez a
hundred per cent white man!<br />
Now, most modern talking is little better than a series of conventional
grunts; most people seem to aim deliberately at not saying anything with
meaning, at least in normal conversation. (James Branch Cabell is
exceedingly funny in his displays of this intolerable habit.)<br />
I once had a most wholesome lesson: how diffuse and therefore
unnecessary is much of even our most would-be-compressed speech.<br />
I had been charged by my Superior with the reconstruction of a certain
ritual.1 This was in 1912; already the tempo of the world had speeded up
mercilessly; to get people to learn even short passages by heart would
be no easy job. So, warned by the prolix, pious, priggish and
platitudinous horrors of Freemasonry (especially the advanced degrees of
the Scottish and Egyptian Rites), I resolved to cut the cackle and come
to the ’osses in the most drastic manner of which I was capable.<br />
It was a great success.<br />
But then we had a candidate who was stone deaf. (Not “a little hard of
hearing;” his tympana were burst.)<br />
Obviously, one could show him slips of paper, as one did in talking to
him. But there in much of the ceremony the candidate must be
hoodwinked!<br />
Nothing for it but to communicate by the deaf and dumb alphabet on his
fingers. This I did—and found that I could cut out on the spur of the
moment at least forty per cent of the “Irreducible minimum” without
doing any damage at all to the effect of the ritual. “That larned
’im!”<br />
Of course, there is such a thing as the Art of Conversation; I have been
lucky enough to know three, perhaps four, of the world’s best talkers;
but that is not to the point. As well object to impasto because it
wastes paint.<br />
What I am out to complain of is what I seriously believe to be an
organised conspiracy of the Black Lodges to prevent people from
thinking.<br />
Naked and unashamed! In some countries there has already been compulsory
listening-in to Government programmes; and who knows how long it will be
before we are all subjected by law to the bleatings, bellowings,
belchings of the boring balderdash of the B.B.C. issies?<br />
They boast of the freedom of religious thought; yet only the narrowest
sectarian propaganda is allowed to approach the microphone. I quite
expect censorship of books—that of the newspapers, however vehemently
denied, is actually effective—and even of private letters. This will
mean an enormous increase in parasitic functionaries who can be trusted
to vote for the rascals that invented their sinecures. That was, in
fact, the poison ivy that strangled the French poplar!<br />
But these soul-suffocating scoundrels know well their danger. There are
still a few people about who have learnt to think; and they are palsied
with terror lest, as might happen at any moment these people realised
the peril, organised, and made a clean sweep of the whole brood of
scolex!<br />
So nobody must be allowed to think at all. Down with the public schools!
Children must be drilled mentally by quarter-educated herdsmen, whose
wages would stop at the first sign of disagreement with the bosses. For
the rest, deafen the whole world with senseless clamour. Mechanise
everything!<br />
Give nobody a chance to think. Standardise “amusement.” The louder and
more cacophonous, the better! Brief intervals between one din and the
next can be filled with appeals, repeated ’till hypnotic power gives
them the force of orders, to buy this or that product of the “Business
men” who are the real power in the State. Men who betray their country
as obvious routine.<br />
The history of the past thirty years is eloquent enough, one would
think. What these sodden imbeciles never realise is that a living
organism must adapt itself intelligently to its environment, or go under
at the first serious change of circumstance.<br />
Where would England be today if there had not been one man,2
deliberately kept “in the wilderness” for decades as “unsound,”
“eccentric,” “dangerous,” “not to be trusted,” “impossible to work
with,” to take over the country from the bewildered “safe” men?<br />
And what could he have done unless the people had responded? Nothing. So
then there is still a remnant whose independence, sense of reality, and
manhood begin to count when the dear, good, woolly flock scatter in
terror at the wolf’s first howl.<br />
Yes, they are there, and they can get us back our freedom—if only we can
make them see that the enemy in Whitehall is more insidiously fatal than
the foe in Brown shirt House.<br />
On this note of hope I will back to my silence.<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-xv-sex-morality">Chapter XV: Sex Morality</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
Thank you! I am to cover the whole question of sex in a few well-chosen
words? Am I to suppose that you want to borrow money? Such fulsome
flattery suggests the indirect approach.<br />
As a matter of fact, your proposal is not so outrageous as it sounds at
first; for as far as the English language goes, there is really hardly
anything worth reading. 98.138 per cent of it is what Frances Ridley
Ravergal used to call “fiddlesticks, blah, boloney, Bull-shit, and the
bunk.”<br />
However, quite recently I issued an Encyclical to the Faithful with the
attractive title of Artemis Iota, and I propose that we read this into
the record, to save trouble, and because it gives a list of practically
all the classics that you ought to read. Also, it condenses information
and advice to “beginners,” with due reference to the positive
injunctions given in the Book of the Law.<br />
Still, for the purpose of these letters, I should like to put the whole
matter in a nutshell. The Tree of Life, as usual, affords a convenient
means of classification.<br />
1. To the physical side of it psychological laws apply. “Don’t monkey
with the buzz-saw!” as John Wesley might have put it, though I doubt
whether he did.<br />
2. The “moral” side. As in the case of the voltage of a cissoid, there
isn’t one. Mind your own business! is the sole sufficient rule. To drag
in social, economic, religious, and such aspects is irrelevance and
impurity.<br />
3. The Magical side. Sex is, directly or indirectly, the most powerful
weapon in the armoury of the Magician; and precisely because there is no
moral guide, it is indescribably dangerous. I have given a great many
hints, especially in Magick, and The Book of Thoth—some of the cards are
almost blatantly revealing; so I have been rapped rather severely over
the knuckles for giving children matches for playthings. My excuse has
been that they have already got the matches, that my<br />
explanations have been directed to add conscious precautions to the
existing automatic safeguards.<br />
The above remarks refer mainly to the technique of the business; and it
is going a very long way to tell you that you ought to be able to work
out the principles thereof from your general knowledge of Magick, but
especially the Formula of Tetragrammaton, clearly stated and explained
in Magick, Chap. III. Combine this with the heart of Chap. XII and
you’ve got it!<br />
But there is another point at issue. This incidentally, is where the
“automatic safeguards” come in.</p>
<p>“…thou hast no right but to do thy will.” (AL I, 42) means that to
“go a whoring after strange”</p>
<p>purposes can only be disastrous. It is possible, in chemistry, to
provoke an endothermic reaction; but that is only asking for trouble.
The product bears within its own heart the seed of dissolution.<br />
Accordingly, the most important preliminary to any Magical operation is
to make sure that its object is not only harmonious with, but necessary
to, your Great Work.<br />
Note also that the use of this supreme method involves the manipulation
of energies ineffably secret and most delicately sensitive; it compares
with the operations of ordinary Magick as the last word in artillery
does with the blunderbuss!<br />
I ought to have mentioned the sexual instinct or impulse in itself,
careless of magical or any other considerations soever: the thing that
picks you up by the scruff of the neck, slits your weasand with a
cavalry sabre, and chucks the remains over the nearest precipice.<br />
What is the damn thing, anyway?</p>
<p>That’s just the trouble; for it is the first of the masks upon the
face of the True Will; and that mask is the Poker-Face!<br />
As all true Art is spontaneous, is genius, is utterly beyond all
conscious knowledge or control, so also is sex. Indeed, one might class
it as deeper still than Art; for Art does at least endeavour to find
an<br />
intelligible means of expression. That is much nearer to sanity than the
blind lust of the sex-impulse.<br />
The maddest genius does look from Chokmah not only to Binah, but to the
fruit of that union in Da’ath and the Ruach; the sex-impulse has no use
for Binah to understand, to interpret, to transmit.<br />
It wants no more than an instrument which will destroy it.<br />
“Here, I say, Master, have a heart!”<br />
Nonsense! (I continue) What I say is the plain fact, and well you know
it! More, damned up, hemmed in, twisted and tortured as it has been by
religion and morality and all the rest of it, it has learnt to disguise
itself, to appear in a myriad forms of psychosis, neurosis, actual
insanity of the most dangerous types. You don’t have to look beyond
Hitler! Its power and its peril derive directly from<br />
the fatal fact that in itself it is the True Will in its purest
form.<br />
What then is the magical remedy? Obvious enough to the Qabalist. “Love
is the law, love under will.”<br />
It must be fitted at its earliest manifestations with its proper Binah,
so as to flow freely along the Path of Daleth, and restore the lost
Balance. Attempts to suppress it are fatal, to sublime it are false and
futile. But guided wisely from the start, by the time it becomes strong
it has learnt how to use its<br />
virtues to the best advantage.<br />
And what of the parallel instinct in a woman? Except in (rather rare)
cases of congenital disease or deformity, the problem is never so
acute.<br />
For Binah, even while she winks at Chokmah, has the other eye wide-open,
swivelled on Tiphareth.<br />
Her True Will is thus divided by Nature from the start, and her tragedy
is if she fails to unite these two objects. Oh, dear me, yes, I know all
about “spretæ injuria formæ” and “furens quid femina possit”; but that
is only because when she misses her bite she feels doubly baffled,
robbed not only of the ecstatic Present, but of the glamorous Future. If
she eat independently of the Fruit of the Tree of Life when unripe, she
has not only the bad taste in the mouth, but indigestion to follow.
Then, living as she does so much in the world of imagination, constantly
living shadow-pictures of her Desire, she is not nearly so liable to the
violent insanities of sheer blind lust, as is the male. The essential
difference is indicated by that of their respective orgasms, the female
undulatory, the male catastrophic.<br />
The above, taken all in all, may not be fully comprehensive, not wholly
satisfying to the soul, but one thing with another, enough for a cow to
chew the cud on.<br />
Good night!<br />
Love is the law, love under will.<br />

<p>Chapter XVI: On Concentration<br />
Cara Soror,<br />
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.<br />
You wisely ask me for a special letter on Concentration; you point out
that I have implied it constantly, but never given plain
instruction.<br />
It hope I have not been so vague as to allow you to suppose that
Concentration Camps are evidence that benevolent and enlightened
governments are at last seriously concerned to educate the world to
Yoga; but I do agree that it cannot do great harm if I take a dose of my
own medicine, and gather into one golden sheaf all the ripe corn of my
wisdom on this subject.<br />
For concentration does indeed unlock all doors; it lies at the heart of
every practice as it is of the essence of all theory; and almost all the
various rules and regulations are aimed at securing adeptship in this
matter. All the subsidiary work—awareness, one-pointedness,
mind-fullness and the rest—is intended to train you to this.<br />
All the greetings, salutations, “Saying Will,” periodical adorations,
even saying “apo pantos kakodaimonos” with a downward and outward sweep
of the arm, the eyes averted, when one sees a person dressed in a
religious (Christian) uniform: all these come under “Don’t stroke the
cat the wrong way!” or, in the modern pseudo-scientific journalese
jargon “streamlining life.”<br />
Let us see if Frater Perdurabo has anything to the point! Of course,
Part I of Book 4 is devoted to it; but there is too much, and not
enough, to be useful to us just now.<br />
What you really need is the official Instruction in The Equinox, and the
very fullest and deepest understanding of Eight Lectures on Yoga; but
these lectures are so infernally interesting that when I look into the
book for something to quote, it carries me away with it. I can’t put it
down, I forget all about this letter. Rather a back-handed advertisement
for Concentration!<br />
The best way is the hardest; to forget all this and start from the
beginning as if there had never been anything on the subject written
before.<br />
I must keep always in mind that you are assumed to know nothing whatever
about Yoga and Magick, or anything else beyond what the average educated
person may be assumed to have been taught.<br />
What is the problem? There are two.<br />
ß: To train the mind to move with the maximum speed and energy, with the
utmost possible accuracy<br />
in the chosen direction, and with the minimum of disturbance or
friction. That is Magick.<br />
a: To stop the mind altogether. That is Yoga.<br />
The rules, strangely enough, are identical in both cases; at least,
until your “Magick” is perfect; Yoga merely goes on a step further. In
Beta you have reduced all movements from many to One; in Alpha you
reduce that One to Zero.<br />
Now then, with a sigh of relief, know you this: that every possible
incident in the Beta training is mutatis mutandis, perfectly familiar to
the engineer.<br />
The material must be chosen and prepared in the kind and in the manner,
best suited to the design of the intended machine; the various parts
must be put together with the utmost precision; every obstacle to the
function must be removed, and every source of error eliminated. Now
cheer up, child!<br />
In the ase of a machine that he has devised and constructed himself with
every condition in his favour, he thinks he is doing not too badly if he
gets some fifteen or twenty per cent of the calculated efficiency out of
the instrument; and even Nature, with millions of years to adjust and
improve, very often cannot boast of having done much better. So you have
no reason to be discouraged if success<br />
does not smile upon you in the first week or so of your Work, starting
as you do with material of whose properties you are miserably ignorant,
with means pitifully limited, with Laws of Nature which you do not
understand; in fact, with almost everything against you but indomitable
Will and unconquerable courage.<br />
(I know I’m a poor contemptible Lowbrow; but I refuse to be ashamed for
finding Kipling’s If and Henley’s Don’t remember-the title; they may not
be poetry—but they are honest food and damned good beer for the plebeian
wayfarer. It was such manhood, not the left-wing high-brow Bloomsbury
sissies, that kept London through the blitz. Pray forgive the
digression!)<br />
There is only one method to adopt in such circumstances as those of the
Aspirant to Magick and Yoga: the method of Science. Trial and error. You
must observe. That implies, first of all, that you must learn to
observe. And you must record your observations. No circumstance of life
is, or can be irrelevant. “He that is not with me is against me.” In all
these letters you will find only two things:<br />
either I tell you what is bad for you, or what is good for you. But I am
not you; I don’t know every detail of your life, every trick of your
thought. You must do ninety percent of the work for yourself.<br />
Whether it is love, or your daily avocation, or diet, or friends, or
amusement, or anything else, you must find out what helps you to your
True Will and what hinders; cherish the one and eschew the other.<br />
I want to insist most earnestly that concentration is not, as we nearly
all of us think, a matter of getting things right in the practices; you
must make every breath you draw subservient to the True Will, to
fertilise the soil for the practices. When you sit down in your Asana to
quiet your mind, it is much easier for you if your whole life has tended
to relative quietude; when you knock with your Wand to announce the
opening of an Invocation, it is better if the purpose of that ceremony
has been simmering in the background of your thought since
childhood!<br />
Yes indeed: background!<br />
Deep down, on the very brink of the subconscious, are all those facts
which have determined you to choose this your Great Work.<br />
Then, the ambition, conscious, which arranges the general order and
disposition of your life.<br />
Lastly, the practices themselves. And my belief is that the immense
majority of failures have their neglect to brush up their drill to thank
for it.<br />
For technical advice on all these subjects, I shall refer you to those
official works mentioned in the early part of this letter; I shall be
happy if you will take to heart what I am now so violently thrusting at
you, this Middle Work of Concentration.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.<br />

id="chapter-xvii-astral-journey-example-how-to-do-it-how-to-verify-your-experience">Chapter
XVII: Astral Journey: Example, How to do it, How to Verify your
Experience</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>There is no better way of training the memory than the practice of
the Holy Qabalah.<br />
The whole mechanism of memory depends on joining up independent data.
You must go on adding a little to little, always joining the simple
impressions by referring them to others which are more general; and so
on until the whole of your universe is arranged like the brain and the
nervous system.<br />
This system in fact, becomes the Universe. When you have got everything
properly correlated, your central consciousness understands and controls
every tiniest detail. But you must begin at the beginning—you go out for
a walk, and the first thing you see is a car; that represents the Atu
VII, the Chariot, referred to Cancer.<br />
Then you come to a fishmonger, and notice certain crustacea, very mala
chostomous. This comes under the same sign of Cancer. The next thing you
notice is an amber coloured dress in Swan and Edgar’s; amber also is the
colour of Cancer in the King’s Scale. Now then you have a set of three
impressions which is joined together by the fact that they all belong to
the Cancer class; experience<br />
will soon teach that you can remember all three very much more clearly
and accurately than you could any one of the three singly.<br />
You have not increased the burden on your memory, but diminished
it.<br />
What you say about tension and eagerness and haste is very true. See The
Book of the Law, Chapter I, 44.<br />
“For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of
result, is every way perfect.”<br />
This, from a practical point of view, is one of the most important
verses in the book.<br />
The unusual word “unassuaged” is very interesting. People generally
suppose that “will” is the slave of purpose, that you cannot will a
thing properly unless you are aiming at a definite goal. But this is not
the case. Thinking of the goal actually serves to distract the mind. In
these few words is included the whole method without all the bombastic
piety of the servile doctrine of mysticism about the surrender of the
Will. Nor is this idea of surrender actually correct; the will must be
identified with the Divine Will, so-called.<br />
One wants to become like a mighty flowing river, which is not
consciously aiming at the sea, and is certainly not yielding to any
external influence. It is acting in conformity with the law of its own
nature, with the Tao. One can describe it, if necessary, as “passive
love”; but it is love (in effect) raised to its highest potential. We
come back to the same thing: when passion is purged of any “lust of
result” it is irresistible; it has become “Law.”<br />
I can never understand why it is that mystics fail to see that their
smarmy doctrine of surrender actually insists upon the duality which
they have set out to abolish!<br />
I certainly have no intention of “holding you down” to “a narrow path of
work” or any path. All I can do is to help you to understand clearly the
laws of your own nature, so that you may go ahead without extraneous
influence. It does not follow that a plan that I have found successful
in my own case will be any use to you. That is another cardinal mistake
of most teachers. One must have<br />
become a Master of the Temple to annihilate one’s ego.</p>
<p>Most teachers, consciously or unconsciously, try to get others to
follow in their steps. I might as well dress you up in my castoff
clothing! (In the steps of the Master. At the feet of the Master.
Steward!)<br />
Please observe that the further you get on, the higher your potential,
the greater is the tendency to leak, or even to break the containing
vessel. I can help you by warning you against setting up obstacles, real
or imaginary, in your own path; which is what most people do. It is
almost laughable to think that the Great Work consists merely in
“letting her rip;” but Karma bumps you from one side of the toboggan
slide to the other, until you come into the straight.” (There’s a
chapter or two in the Book of Lies about this, but I haven’t got a copy.
I must find one, and put them in here. Yes: p. 22)1<br />
O thou that settest out upon the Path, false is the Phantom that thou
seekest. When thou hast it thou shalt know all bitterness, thy teeth
fixed in the Sodom-Apple. Thus hast thou been lured along that Path,
whose terror else had driven thee far away.<br />
O thou that stridest upon the middle of the Path, no phantoms mock thee.
For the stride’s sake thou stridest.<br />
Thus art thou lured along that Path, whose fascination else had driven
thee far away.<br />
O thou that drawest toward the End of The Path, effort is no more.
Faster and faster dost thou fall; thy weariness is changed into
Ineffable Rest.<br />
For there is no Thou upon that Path: thou hast become The Way.<br />
As in the Yi King, the 3rd hexagram has departed from the original
perfection, and it takes all the rest of the hexagrams to put things
right again.<br />
The result, it is true, is superior; the perfection of the original has
been enhanced and enriched by its experience.<br />
There is another way of defining the Great Work. That explains to us the
whole object of manifestation, of departing from the perfection of
“Nothing” towards the perfection of “everything”, and one may consider
this advantage, that it is quite impossible to go wrong. Every
experience, whatever may be its nature, is just another necessary
bump.<br />
Naturally one cannot realise this until one becomes a Master of the
Temple; consequently one is perpetually plunged in sorrow and despair.
There is, you see, a good deal more to it than merely learning one’s
mistakes. One can never be sure what is right and what is wrong, until
one appreciates that “wrong” is equally “right.” Now then one gets rid
of the idea of “effort” which is associated with “lust of result.” All
that one does is to exercise pleasantly and healthfully one’s
energies.<br />
It will not do to regard “man” as the “final cause” of manifestation.
Please do not quote myself against me.</p>
<p>“Man is so infinitely small,<br />
In all these stars, determinate.<br />
Maker and master of them all,<br />
Man is so infinitely great.”2</p>
<p>The human apparatus is the best instrument of which we are, at
present, aware in our normal consciousness; but when you come to
experience the Conversation of the higher intelligences, you will
understand how imperfect are your faculties. It is true that you can
project these intelligences as parts of yourself, or you can suppose
that certain human vehicles may be temporally employed by them for
various purposes; but these speculations tend to be idle. The important
thing is to make contact with beings, whatever their nature, who are
superior to yourself, not merely in degree but it kind. That is to say,
not merely different as a Great Dane differs from a Chihuahua, but as a
buffalo differs from either.</p>
<p>Of course you are perfectly right about the senses, though I would
not agree to confine the meaning to the five which are common to most
people. There must, one might suspect, be ways of apprehending directly
such phenomena as magnetism, electrical resistance, chemical affinity
and the like. Let me direct you once more to The Book of the Law,
Chapter II, vs. 70 - 72.<br />
“There is help &amp; hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! Then
canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou
drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed
by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety
therein!<br />
”But exceed! exceed!<br />
“Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine—and doubt it not, an if
thou art ever joyous!—death is the crown of all.”<br />
The mystic’s idea of deliberately stupefying and stultifying himself is
an “abomination unto the Lord.”<br />
This, by the way, does not conflict with the rules of Yoga. That kind of
suppression is comparable to the restrictions in athletic training, or
diet in sickness.<br />
Now we get back to the Qabalah—how to make use of it.<br />
Let us suppose that you have been making an invocation, or shall we call
it an investigation, and suppose you want to interpret a passage of
Bach. To play this is the principal weapon of your ceremony. In the
course of your operation, you assume your astral body and rise far above
the terrestrial atmosphere, while the music continues softly in the
background. You open your eyes, and find that it is night. Dark clouds
are on the horizon; but in the zenith is a crown of
constellations.<br />
This light helps you, especially as your eyes become accustomed to the
gloom, to take in your surroundings. It is a bleak and barren landscape.
Terrific mountains rim the world. In the midst looms a cluster of
blue-black crags. Now there appears from their recesses a gigantic
being. His strength, especially in his hands and in his loins, it
terrifying. He suggests a combination of lion, mountain goat and
serpent; and you instantly jump to the idea that this is one of the rare
beings which the Greeks called Chimaera. So formidable is his appearance
that you consider it prudent to assume an appropriate god-form. But who
is the appropriate god?<br />
You may perhaps consider it best, in view of your complete ignorance as
to who he is and where you are, to assume the god-form of Harpocrates,
as being good defence in any case; but of course this will not take you
very far. If you are sufficiently curious and bold, you will make up
your mind rapidly on this point. This is where your daily practice of
the Qabalah will come in useful. You run through in your mind the seven
sacred planets. The very first of them seems quite consonant with what
you have so far seen. Everything suits Saturn well enough. To be on the
safe side, you go through the others; but this is a very obvious
case—Saturn is the only planet that agrees with everything. The only
other possibility will be the Moon; but there is no trace noticeable of
any of her more amiable characteristics. You will therefore make up your
mind that it is a Saturnian god-form that you need.<br />
Fortunate indeed for you that you have practiced daily the assumption of
such forms! Very firmly, very steadily, very slowly, very quietly, you
transform your normal astral appearance into that of Sebek. The
Chimaera, recognizing your divine authority, becomes less formidable and
menacing in appearance. He may, in some way, indicate his willingness to
serve you. Very good, so far; but it is of course the first essential to
make sure of his integrity. Accordingly you begin by asking his
name.<br />
This is vital; because if he tells you the truth, it gives you power
over him. But if, on the other hand, he tells you a lie, he abandons for
good and all his fortress. He becomes rather like a submarine whose base
has been destroyed. He may do you a lot of mischief in the meantime, of
course, so look out!<br />
Well then, he tells you that his name is Ottillia. Shall we try to spell
it in Greek or in Hebrew. By the sound of the name and perhaps to some
extent by his appearance one might plump for the former; but after all
the Greek Qabalah is so unsatisfactory. We give Hebrew the first
chance—we start with Ayin Teth Yod Lamed Yod Aleph Hé. Let us try this
lettering for a start. It adds up to 135. I daresay that you don’t
remember what the Sepher Sephiroth tells you about the number; but as
luck will have it, there is no need to inquire; for 135 = 3 x 45. Three
is the number, is the first number of Saturn, and 45 the last. (The sum
of the numbers in the magic square of Saturn is 45.) That corresponds
beautifully with everything you have got so far; but then of course you
must know if he is “one of the believing Jinn.” Briefly, is he a friend
or an enemy? You accordingly say to him “The word of the Law is Te..µa”
It turns out that he doesn’t understand Greek at all, so you were
certainly right in choosing Hebrew. You put it to him, “What is the word
of the Law?” and he replies darkly. “The word of the Law is Thora.” That
means nothing to you; any one might know as much as that, Thora being
the ordinary word for the Sacred Law of Israel, and you accordingly ask
him to spell it to make sure you have heard aright; and he gives you the
letters, perhaps by speaking them, perhaps by showing them: Teth, Resh,
Ayin. You add these up and get 279. This again is divisible by the
Saturnian 3, and the result is 93; in other words, he has been precisely
right. On the plane of Saturn one may multiply by three and therefore he
has given you the correct word “Thelema” in a form unfamiliar to you.
You may now consider yourself satisfied of his good faith, and may
proceed to inspect him more closely. The stars above his head suggest
the influence of Binah, whose number also is three, while the most
striking thing about him is the core of his being: the letter Yod. (One
does not count the termination “AH”: being a divine suffix it represents
the inmost light and the outermost light.) This Yod, this spark of
intense brilliance, is of the pale greenish gold which one sees (in this
world) in the fine gold leaf of Tibet. It glows with ever greater
intensity as you concentrate upon observing him, which you could not do
while you were preoccupied with investigating his credentials.</p>
<p>Confidence being thus established, you inquire why he as appeared to
you at this time and at this place; and the answer to this question is
of course your original idea, that is to say, he is presenting to you in
other terms that “mountainous Fugue” which invoked him. You listen to
him with attention, make such enquiries as seem good to you, and record
the proceedings.</p>
<p>The above example is, of course, pure imagination, and represents a
very favourable case. You are only too likely, and that not only at the
beginning, to meet all sorts of difficulties and dangers.</p>

id="chapter-xviii-the-importance-of-our-conventional-greetings-etc.">Chapter
XVIII: The Importance of our Conventional Greetings, etc.</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>From time to time I have exhorted you with mine accustomed matchless
eloquence never to neglect the prescribed Greetings: but I think it just
as well to collect the various considerations connected with their
use—and in “Greetings” I include “saying Will” before set meals, the
four daily adorations of the Sun (Liber CC, vel Resh) and the salutation
of Our Lady the Moon.1 I propose to deal with the general object of the
combined rituals, not with the special virtues of each separately.<br />
The practice of Liber III vel Jugorum is the complement of these grouped
customs. By sharp physical self-chastisement when you think, say, or do
whatever it is that you have set yourself to avoid doing, you set a
sentry at the gate of your mind ready to challenge all comers, and so
you acquire the habit of being on the alert. Keep this in mind, and you
will have no difficulty in following the argument of this letter.<br />
When you are practicing Dharana + concentration, you allow yourself so
many minutes. It is a steady, sustained effort. The mind constantly
struggles to escape control. (I hope you remember the sequence of
“breaks.” In case you don’t, I summarise them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Immediate physical interruptions: Asana should stop these.<br />
</li>
<li>Things that are “on you mind.”<br />
</li>
<li>Reverie, and “Wouldn’t it help if I were to— ?”<br />
</li>
<li>Atmospherics—e.g. voices apparently from some alien source.<br />
</li>
<li>Aberrations of the control itself; and the result itself. (Remember
the practice of some Hindu schools: “Not that, not that!” to whatever it
is the presents itself as Tat Sat—reality, truth).</li>
</ol>
<p>Need I remind you how urgent the wish to escape will assuredly
become, how fantastic are the mind’s devices and excuses, amounting
often to deliberate revolt? In Kandy I broke away in a fury, and dashed
down to Colombo with the intention of painting the very air as red as
the betel- spittle on the pavements! But after three days of futile
search for satisfying debauchery I came back to my horses, and, sure
enough, it was merely that I had gone stale; the relaxation soothed and
steadied me; I resumed the discipline with redoubled energy, and Dhyana
dawned before a week had elapsed.<br />
I mention this because it is the normal habit of the mind to organise
these counter-attacks that makes their task so easy. What you need is a
mind that will help rather than hinder your Work by its normal
function.<br />
This is where these Greetings, and Will-sayings, and Adorations come
in.<br />
It is not a concentration-practice proper; I haven’t a good word for it.
“Background concentration” or “long-distance-concentration” are clumsy,
and not too accurate. It is really rather like a public school
education. One is not constantly “doing a better thing that one has ever
done;” one is not dropping one’s eye-glass every two minutes, or being a
little gentleman in the act of brushing one’s hair. The point is that
one trains oneself to react properly at any moment of surprise. It must
become “second nature” for “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the
Law.” to spring to the forefront of the mind when one is introduced to a
stranger, or comes down to breakfast, or hears the telephone bell, or
observes the hour of the adoration, (these are to be the superficial
reactions, like instinctively rising when a lady enters the room), or,
at the other end, in moments of immediate peril, or of sudden
apprehension, or when in one’s meditation, one approaches the deepest
strata.<br />
One need not be dogmatic about the use of these special words. One might
choose a formula to represent one’s own particular True Will. It is a
little like Cato, (or Scipio, was it?) who concluded every speech,
whether about the Regulations of the Roman Bath or the proposal to
reclaim a marsh of the Maremma, with the words: “And moreover, in my
opinion, Carthage ought to be destroyed.”<br />
Got it?<br />
You teach the mind to push your thought automatically to the very thing
from which it was trying to wander. “Yes, I get you Stephen! . . . But,
Uncle Dudley, come clean, do you always do all this yourself? Don’t you
sometimes feel embarrassed, or fear that you may destroy the effect of
your letter, or”create a scene” in the public street when you suddenly
stop and perform these incomprehensible antics, or simply forget about
the whole thing?”<br />
Yes, I do.<br />
Peccavi.<br />
Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.<br />
I am not your old and valued friend, Adam Qadmon, the Perfect Man.<br />
I am a pretty poor specimen.<br />
I am nothing to cable about to Lung Peng Choung, or Himi, or
Monsalvat.<br />
I do forget now and again; though, I am glad to say, not nearly as often
as I used to do. (As the habit is acquired, it tends to strengthen
itself). But often I deliberately omit to do my duty. I do funk it. I do
resent it. I do feel that it’s too much bother.<br />
As I said above, Adam Qadman is not my middle name.<br />
Well now, have I any shadow of an excuse? Yes, I have, after a fashion;
I don’t think it good manners to force my idiosyncrasies down people’s
throats, and I don’t want to appear more of an eccentric than I need. It
might detract from my personal influence, and so actually harm the Work
that I am trying to perform. . .<br />
“Yes, that’s all very well, Alibi Ike; you are exceedingly well known as
a Scripture-quoting Satan, as a Past-Master in self-justification.
Trained from infancy by the Plymouth Brethren, who for casuistry leave
the Jesuits at the post!” “Yes, yes, but — — —.” “You needn’t but me no
buts, you old he-goat!<br />
Wasn’t there once a Jonas Hanway, the first man to sport an umbrella?
Wouldn’t your practice be natural, and right, and the cream of the cream
of good manners as soon as a few hundred people of position took to
doing it? And wouldn’t Thomas, Richard, and Henry, three months later,
make a point of doing the same as their betters?” (That was Conscience
speaking.)</p>
<p>All right, you win.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xix-the-act-of-truth">Chapter XIX: The Act of Truth</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>It seems that last Wednesday I so far forgot myself as to refer to
the “Act of Truth” in conversation, and never mentioned what it is when
it’s at home, or why anyone should perform it, or what happens when one
does perform it!<br />
All right, I will remedy that; luckily, it is a very simple matter; very
important, perfectly paradoxical and devastatingly effective.<br />
Analysed, it is to make the assumption that something which seems very
wrong is actually all right, that an eager wish is an accomplished fact.
a reasonable anxiety, entirely unfounded—and to act accordingly.<br />
For instance, I’m in some desolate place, dependent for my food supply
on a weekly messenger. If he is a day late, it is awkward; if two, it
means hardship; if three, serious risk. One is naturally anxious as the
day approaches; perhaps the weather, or some similar snag, makes it
likely that he will be late. From one cause or another, I have rather
exceeded my ration. There is nothing I can do<br />
about it, materially.<br />
The sensible course of action is to draw in my horns, live on the
minimum, necessary to life, which involves cutting the day’s work down
to almost nothing, and hope for the best, expecting the worst.<br />
But there is a Magical mode of procedure. You say to yourself: I am here
to do this Work in accordance with my true Will. The Gods have got to
see to it that I’m not baulked by any blinking messenger. (But take care
They don’t overhear you; They might mistake it for Hybris, or
presumption. Do it all in the Sign of Silence, under the aegis of
Harpocrates, the “Lord of Defence and Protection”; be careful to assume
his God-form, as standing on two crocodiles. Then you increase your
consumption, and at the same time put in a whole lot of extra Work. If
you perform this “Act of Truth” properly, with genuine conviction that
nothing can go wrong, your messenger will arrive a day early, and bring
an extra-large supply.<br />
This, let me say at once, is very difficult, especially at first, until
one has gained confidence in the efficacy of the Formula; and it is very
nastily easy to “fake.” Going through the motions (as they say) is more
futile here than in most cases, and the results of messing it up are
commonly disastrous.</p>
<p>Do not be misled by any apparent superficial resemblance to
“Christian Science” and “Coueism” and their cackling kin. They miss
every essential feature of the formula.<br />
You must invent your act to suit your case, every time; suppose you
expect a cable next Friday week, transferring cash to your account. You
need $500 to make up an important payment, and you don’t know whether
they will send even $200. What are you going to do about it? Skimp, and
save your expenses, and make yourself miserable and incapable of
vigorous thought or action? You may succeed in saving enough to swing
the deal; but you won’t get a penny beyond the amount actually<br />
needed—and look at the cost in moral grandeur!<br />
No, go and stand yourself a champagne luncheon, and stroll up Bond
Street with an 8 1/2 “Hoyo de Monterey,” and squander $30 on some
utterly useless bauble. Then the $500 will swell to $1000, and arrive
two days early at that!<br />
There are one or two points to consider very carefully indeed before you
start:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The proposed Act must be absurd; it won’t do at all if by some
fluke, however unlikely, it might accomplish your aim. For instance,
it’s no use backing an outsider. There must be no causal link.<br />
</li>
<li>The Act must be one which makes the situation definitely worse.
E.g.: suppose you are counting on a new dress to make a hit at a
Reception, and doubt whether it is so much better than your present
best, or whether it will be finished in time. Then, wear that present
best tonight (wet, of course), knowing you are sure to soil it.<br />
</li>
<li>Obviously, all the usual conditions of a Magical Operation apply in
this as in all cases; your aim must conform with your True Will, and all
that; but there is one curious point about an Act of Truth: this, that
one should resort to it only when there is no other method possible. In
the explorer’s case, above, it won’t do if he has any means of hurrying
up the messenger.<br />
It seems to me that the above brief sketch should suffice an intelligent
and imaginative student like yourself; but if any point remains
darkling, let me know, and I will follow up with a postscript.</li>
</ol>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,<br />
666</p>
<p>P.S.—I thought it might help you if I were to make a few experiments.
I have done so. Result: this is much more difficult and delicate an
affair than I had thought when I wrote this letter. For instance, one
single thought of a “second string”—e.g. “if it fails, I had better do
so and so”—is enough to kill the while operation stone dead. Of course,
I am totally out of practice; but, even so . . . . . .</p>
<h3 id="chapter-xx-talismans-the-lamen-the-pantacle">Chapter XX:
Talismans: The Lamen: The Pantacle</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Really you comfort me when you turn from those abstruse and exalted
themes with which you have belaboured me so often of late to dear
cuddlesome little questions like this in our letter received this
morning: “Do please, dear Master, give me some hints about how to make
Talismans (that’s the same as Telesmata, isn’t it? Yes, 666) and the
Pantacle. The official instructions are quite clear, of course;<br />
1 but somehow I find them just a little frightening.”<br />
Well, I think I know pretty well what you mean; so I will try to imitate
the style of Aunt Tabitha in “The Flapper’s Fireside.”<br />
For one thing, you forgot to mention the Lamen. Now what are these
things when they are at home?<br />
That’s easy enough.<br />
The Lamen is a sort of Coat of Arms. It expresses the character and
powers of the wearer.<br />
A talisman is a storehouse of some particular kind of energy, the kind
that is needed to accomplish the task for which you have constructed
it.<br />
The Pantacle is often confused with both the others; accurately, it is a
“Minutum Mundum”, “the Universe in Little”; it is a map of all that
exists, arranged in the Order of Nature. There is a chapter in Book 4,
Part II, devoted to it (pp. 117 - 129); I cannot make up my mind whether
I like it. At the best it is very far from being practical instruction.
(The chapter on the Lamen, pp. 159 - 161, is even<br />
worse.)<br />
An analogy, not too silly, for these three; the Chess-player, the
Openings, and the Game itself.<br />
But—you will object—why be silly at all? Why not say simply that the
Lamen, stating as it does the Character and Powers of the wearer, is a
dynamic portrait of the individual, while the Pantacle, his Universe, is
a static portrait of him? And that, you pursue flattering, is why you
preferred to call the<br />
Weapon of Earth (in the Tarot) the Disk, emphasising its continual
whirling movement rather than the Pantacle of Coin, as is more usual.
Once again, exquisite child of our Father the Archer of Light and of sea
born Aphrodite, your well-known acumen has “nicked the ninety and nine
and one over” as Browning says when he (he too!) alludes to the
Tarot.<br />
As you will have gathered from the above, a Talisman is a much more
restricted idea; it is no more than one of the objects in his Pantacle,
one of the arrows in the quiver of his Lamen. As, then, you would
expect, it is very little trouble to design. All that you need is to
“make considerations” about your proposed operation, decide which
planet, sign, element or sub-element or what not you need to accomplish
your miracle.<br />
As you know, a very great many desirable objects can be attained by the
use of the talismans in the Greater and Lesser Keys of Solomon the King;
also in Pietro di Abano2 and the dubious Fourth Book of Cornelius
Agrippa.3<br />
You must on no account attempt to use the squares given in the Book of
the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage until you have succeeded in the
Operation. More, unless you mean to perform it, and are prepared to go
to any length to do so, you are a fool to have the book in your
possession at all. Those squares are liable to get loose and do things
on their own initiative; and you won’t like it.</p>
<p>The late Philip Haseltine, a young composer of genius, used one of
these squares to get his wife to return to him. He engraved it neatly on
his arm. I don’t know how he proceeded to set to work; but his wife came
back all right, and a very short time afterwards he killed
himself.<br />
Then there are the Elemental Tablets of Sir Edward Kelly and Dr. John
Dee. From these you can extract a square to perform almost any
conceivable operation, if you understand the virtue of the various
symbols which they manifest. They are actually an expansion of the
Tarot. (Obviously, the Tarot itself as a whole is a universal
Pantacle—forgive the pleonasm! Each card, especially is this true<br />
of the Trumps, is a talisman; and the whole may also be considered as
the Lamen of Mercury. It is evidently an Idea far too vast for any human
mind to comprehend in its entirety. For it is “the Wisdom whereby He
created the worlds.”)<br />
The decisive advantage of this system is not that its variety makes it
so adaptable to our needs, but that we already possess the Invocations
necessary to call forth the Energies required. What is perhaps still
more to the point, they work without putting the Magician to such severe
toil and exertion as is needed when he has to write them out from his
own ingenium. Yes! This is weakness on my part, and I am very naughty to
encourage you to shirk the hardest path.<br />
I used often to make the background of my Talismans of four concentric
circles, painting then, the first (inmost) in the King (or Knight)
scale, the second in the Queen, the third in the Prince, and the
outermost in the Princess scale, of the Sign, Planet, or Element to
which I was devoting it. On this, preferably in the “flashing” colours,
I would paint the appropriate Names and Figures.<br />
Lastly, the Talisman may be surrounded with a band inscribed with a
suitable “versicle” chosen from some Holy book, or devised by the
Magician to suit the case.<br />
In the British Museum (and I suppose elsewhere) you may see the medal
struck to commemorate the victory over the Armada. This is a
reproduction, perhaps modified, of the Talisman used by Dee to raise the
storm which scattered the enemy fleet.<br />
You must lay most closely to your heart the theory of the Magical Link
(see Magick pp. 107 - 122) and see well to it that it rings true; for
without this your talisman is worse than useless. It is dangerous; for
all that Energy is bound to expend itself somehow; it will make its own
links with anything handy that takes its fancy; and you can get into any
sort of the most serious kind of trouble.<br />
There is a great deal of useful stuff in Magick; pp. 92 - 100, and
pp. 179 - 189. I could go on all night doing nothing but indicating
sources of information.<br />
Then comes the question of how to “charge” the Talisman, of how to evoke
or to invoke the Beings concerned, and of—oh! of so much that you need a
lifetime merely to master the theory.<br />
Remember, too, please, what I have pointed out elsewhere, that the
greatest Masters have quite often not been Magicians at all,
technically; they have used such devices as Secret Societies, Slogans
and Books. If you are so frivolous as to try to exclude these from our
discourse, it is merely evidence that you have not understood a single
word of what I have been trying to tell you these last few hundred
years!<br />
May I close with a stray example or so? Equinox III, 1, has the
Neophyte’s Pantacle of Frater O.I.V.V.I.O.4 The Frontispiece of the
original (4 volume) edition of Magick, the colours vilely reproduced, is
a Lamen of my own Magick, or a Pantacle of the Science, I’m sure I’m not
sure which!5<br />
Most of my Talismans, like my Invocations, have been poems6. This letter
must be like the Iliad in at least one respect: it does not end; it
stops.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>1: The official instruction on the Pantacle in (Liber A vel Armorum)
states, inter alia, that it should bear “a symbol to represent the
Universe.” The Pantacle and Lamen are both, as Crowley notes, discussed
in Book 4 part II. I am not aware of any official A.’.A.’. instruction
dealing directly with Talismans – T.S.<br />
2: The reference is unlikely to be to the Heptameron, a 16th century
Grimoire spuriously attributed to Abano, as this does not deal with
talismans at all, rather it is a ritual for the evocation of planetary
spirits. According to writers such as Frances Yates and D.P. Walker,
some of the undisputed works of Pietro d’Abano deal with astrological
images and the talismanic use of the same, although I have been unable
to consult these directly – T.S.<br />
3: “The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy, or of Magical Ceremonies” was
a short work on magical practice which first came to public attention in
the 1550s, some twenty years after the death of its alleged author. It
purports to be a “complement and key” to Agrippa’s De Occulta
Philosophia libri tres. The author credit is generally regarded as
spurious. It does however treat at length of the composition of
“pentacles” (pentacula; as described by pseudo-Agrippa they belong more
under the head of “talismans” in Crowley’s classification), giving a few
examples – T.S.<br />
4: C.S. Jones (Frater Achad). Achad’s Lamen design also appeared in that
issue – T.S.<br />
5: The design was reproduced as a colour painting by Steffi Grant in her
essay on Crowley published as Carfax Monograph #3 (reprinted in Hidden
Lore by Kenneth and Steffi Grant, London: Skoob, 1989), as a black and
white line drawing by the same artist in the 1973 RKP edition of
Crowley’s Magick, and as a colour graphic redrawn by an unidentified
illustrator on the dust-jacket of the 1994 “Blue Brick” Weiser edition
of Magick – T.S.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-xxi-my-theory-of-astrology">Chapter XXI: My Theory of
Astrology</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>A few well-chosen words about Astrology? Madam, I am only too happy
to oblige: our aim is to serve. The customer is usually wrong; but
statistics indicate that it doesn’t pay to tell him so.<br />
It seems a long while since I set up your Nativity, and read it, but it
is very clear in my mind that you were astonished, as so many others
have been, by the simplicity and correctness of my reading. It began,
you remember, by your giving me the usual data when we dropped in for
tea at the Anglers’ Rest. I calculated the Ascendant on the spot, and
remarked “Rubbish!” I looked at you again very carefully; and, after
many grunts, observed, “More likely half-past ten—within an hour one way
or the other.” You insisted; I insisted. Unwilling to make a Fracas in
the Inn, we decided to put you to the trouble of writing to your mother
to settle the dispute. Back came the answer: “within a few minutes of
eleven. I remember because your father had hung on as long as he
could—he had to take the morning service.”<br />
This occurrence is very common in my experience; I have contradicted
what sounded like ascertained fact and proved on enquiry to have been
right; so, considering that the statistics I made many years ago showed
me to have been right 109 times out of 120, I think two things are
fairly near probation; firstly, I am not guessing—that doesn’t matter
much; but, secondly, which is of supreme importance, there is a definite
connection between the personal appearance and manner of the native, and
the Sign of the Zodiac which was rising when he first drew air into his
lungs.<br />
Let me add, to strengthen the argument, that on the few occasions where
I have erred there has been a good astrological reason for it. E.g. I
might plump for Pisces rising when it was actually Capricornus; but in
that case Saturn would have been afflicted by being in Cancer, with bad
aspects from Venus and the Moon, thus taking away all his rugged, male,
laborious qualities, and in the Ascendant might have been Jupiter,
suggesting many of the qualities of Pisces: and so forth.<br />
Now let me start! You want me to explain the system—or no-system!—which
I use. I do not “move in a mysterious way My wonders to perform;” for
nothing could be simpler. For its origin I have to thank Abramelin the
Mage, who empties the vials of his scorn upon the astrologers of his
time with their meticulous calculations of “the hours of the planets”
and so on. I think he goes too far when he says that a planet can have
no influence at all, or very little, unless it is above the horizon; but
he meant well, bless him! And, though he does not say so, I believe that
I do my stuff in very much the same way as he did.<br />
Modern astrologers multiply their charts until their desks remind me of
a Bargain Basement in the rush hour! They compare and contrast until
they are in bat-eyed bewilderment bemused; and when the answer turns out
absolutely false, exclaim, what a shout: “By Ptolemy, I forgot to look
at the last Luniation for Buda-Pesth!” But then they can always find
something or other which will explain how they came to go wrong:
naturally, when you have several hundred factors, helplessly bound and
gagged, it would be just too bad if you couldn’t pick out one to serve
your turn—after the event! No, dear girl, it should be obvious to an
unweaned brat:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>they can’t see the wood for the trees,<br />
</li>
<li>they are using Ruach on a proposition which demands Neschamah.
Intellect is quite inadequate; the problem requires mother-wit,
intuition, understanding. Here is my system in a Number 000
Ampoule.<br />
Put up the figure at birth: study it, make notes of the aspects and
dignities, concentrate—and turn on the Magical Tap!<br />
Occasionally, when I began, I set up the “progressed figure” to see how
the patient was doing this week, but it never seemed to help enough to
compensate for the distraction caused by the complication. What I do
observe to examine the situation of to-day is Transits. These I have
found very reliable; but even with these I usually ignore aspects of
minor importance. Truth to tell, conjunctions mean very much more than
the rest put together.<br />
Talking of aspects, I think it ridiculous to allow vast “orbs” like 15—
for Luna, and 12—for Sol.<br />
Astrologers go to extreme lengths to calculate the “solar revolution”
figure not to a degree, not to a minute, but to a second: and that when
they don’t know the exact time of birth within half an hour or more!
Talk about straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel! Then what does an
hour or so matter anyhow, if you are going to allow an aspect, whether
it is 2— or 10— off? This even with delicate aspects like the quintile
or semisextile. What would you think of a doctor who had a special
thermometer made to register -1/100 of a degree, and never took notice
of the fact that the patient had just swallowed a cupful of scalding hot
tea?<br />
In my own work, I disallow a deviation of 5— or 6— from the exact
aspect, unless there is some alien reason for thinking that it is
actually operative. With the minor aspects, I dislike reckoning with
them if they are even 3— away.<br />
Nor do I see any sense in marking the odd minutes in the Ascendant, when
one is not sure even of the decan.<br />
That seems to be about all that is necessary for my “morning hate;”
suppose we go on to the question of interpretation.<br />
Thousands of books have been written on Astrology; nobody could possibly
read them all thoroughly, and he would be a great fool to try. But he
may do little harm by going into them far enough to observe that hardly
any half-dozen are agreed even on the foundations of their system,
hardly any two upon the meaning of any given aspect, dignity, or
position; there is not always agreement even upon what questions pertain
to which houses.<br />
There are a few completely quack systems, such as those which mix up the
science with Toshosophical1 hypotheses; naturally you discard these. But
even of generally acceptable forms of Astrology, such as Mundane and
Horary, I tend to be distrustful. I ask, for instance, why, if Taurus
rules Poland and Ireland, as is no doubt the case, the crash and
massacres of 1939 e.v. and later in the one did not take place in the
other. All the seaports of the world naturally come under one of the
three watery signs; but we do not find that an affliction of Pisces,
which hits Tunis, should do harm to all the other harbours similarly
ruled.<br />
This brings us to the first Big Jump in the steeplechase of the whole
science. We hear of thousands of people being killed at the same time
(within an hour or two, perhaps a minute or two) by earthquake,
shipwreck, explosion, battle or other form of violence. Was the
horoscope of every one of the victims marked with the probability of
some such end? I have known very strange cases of coincidence, but not
to that extent!<br />
The answer, I believe, is manifold. It might be, for example, that
Poland and Ireland are ruled by different degrees of Taurus; that there
are major and minor figures, the former overruling the latter, so that
the figure of the launching of the “Titanic” swallowed up the nativities
of the victims of her wreck.<br />
Something of this sort is really an obvious truth. Flood in China,
famine in India, pestilence anywhere, evidently depend on maps of a
scale far more enormous than the personal.<br />
Then—on this point I feel reasonably sure—there may be one or more
factors of which we know nothing at all, by which the basic
possibilities of a figure are set to work. (Just as a car with engine
running will not start until the clutch is put in.)<br />
I will conclude by announcing a rather remarkable position.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>I see no objection at all to postulating that certain “rays,” or
other means of transmitting some peculiar form or forms of energy, may
reach us from the other parts of the solar system; for we can in fact
point to perfectly analogous phenomena in the discoveries of the last
hundred years or so. But that is no more than a postulate.<br />
</li>
<li>The objections to Astrology as such, indicated by what I have
already pointed out, and several others, would suffice to place me among
the most arrogant disbelievers in the whole study, were it not for what
follows.<br />
</li>
<li>The facts with regard to the Ascendant are so patent, so undeniable,
and so inexplicable without the postulate in (1), that I am utterly
convinced of the fundamental truth of the basic principles of the
science.<br />
I said, “I will conclude”; and I meant it. For now that (or so I hope)
you respect sufficiently my conviction that Astrology is a genuine
science and not a messy mass of Old Wives’ Tales, you will obviously
demand instruction as to how to learn it, that you may verify my opinion
in the light of your own experiments.<br />
This will look much better if I put it in a separate letter.<br />

by more than a few times ahead. Crowley disdained to apply
“Theosophical” to the movement of Anne Besant, preferring to reserve the

“Theosophical” in these references – WEH.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-xxii-how-to-learn-the-practice-of-astrology">Chapter
XXII: How to Learn the Practice of Astrology</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>“Up guards, and at ‘em!” First, you must know your correspondences by
heart backwards and upside down (air connu.) They are practically all in
The Book of Thoth; but “if anyone anything lacks,” look for it in
777.<br />
Then, get a book on Astrology, the older the better. Raphael’s Shilling
Handbook is probably enough for the present purpose. Get well into your
head what the menu says about the natures of the planets, the influence
of the aspects, what is meant by dignities, the scope of the houses, and
so on.<br />
Dovetail all this with your classical knowledge; the character and
qualities, the powers and the exploits, of the several deities
concerned.<br />
Next, learn how to set up a figure of the heavens. This need not take an
average intelligent person more than an hour at the most. You can learn
it from a book. Lastly, get Barley’s 1001 Notable nativities and More
Nativities. Also any other collections available. Practice setting up
the horoscopes. Use the Chaldean square system; it shows at the first
glance what is happening in the angular houses, which are the keys of
the whole figure.<br />
Compare and contrast what you know of the natives, from history, with
what is said of the aspects (and the rest) in the books you have
read.<br />
Put together similar horoscopes; e.g. a dozen which have Sagittarius
rising, another lot with Jupiter in the mid-heaven, and so on; see if
you can find a similarity in their lives with what the books will have
led you to expect.<br />
Don’t be afraid to criticise; on the contrary, do some research work on
your own, and find cases which seem to contradict tradition.<br />
Instance: Saturn in the M.C. is said to cause a spectacular rise in a
man’s career, ending in an equally notable crash. Examples: Napoleon I
and III, Oscar Wilde, Woodrow Wilson, Lord Northcliffe, Hitler.<br />
Look for figures with Saturn thus placed whose natives have jogged along
equably and died in the odour of sanctity. Find out why what worked in
some cases failed in the others.<br />
By the time you have studied (say) 500 nativities you will be already a
fairly competent judge. Work your bloody guns! as Kipling says; get a
friend—just this once I allow you human intercourse—to set up for you
figures of historical importance, or with some outstanding
characteristic (e.g. murderers, champions of sport, statesmen, monsters,
philanthropists, heresiarchs) without telling you to whom it
refers.<br />
Build up the character, profession, story from the nativity. It sounds
incredible; but more than a score of times I have been actually able to
name him!<br />
By the time you have got good at this game—and a most amusing game it
is—you may call yourself a very competent astrologer.<br />
Sometimes, even now, you may assign the figure of the Archbishop of York
to Jabez Balfour or Catherine de Medici; or mix up Moody and Sankey with
Brown and Kennedy; don’t be discouraged; perhaps there may be something
to be said for you after all!<br />
I believe, as I hope, that you will be surprised at the speed with which
you acquire proficiency.<br />
All this time, moreover, you have not been wholly idle. You will have
been running about like a demented rabbit, and trying to spot the rising
sign of everybody you know. Look at them full-face, then profile; and
note salient characteristics, pendulous lips, receding chins, bulbous
noses, narrow foreheads, stuck-out ears, pimples, squints, warts, shape
of face (three main types; thin, jutting, for cardinal signs; square,
steadfast for cherubic; weak, nondescript, for the rest); then the
stature, whether lithe, well-knit, sturdy, muscular, fat or what not; in
short every bodily feature in turn; make up your mind what sign was
rising at birth, and stick to it!<br />
Now to verify your suspicions. The conversation may run thus:<br />
You: “Can you answer a question without answering another which you were
not asked?”<br />
It, surprised: “Why, yes, of course I can.”<br />
You: “Good. Then, do you know the date of the Battle of Waterloo?”<br />
It: “1815.”<br />
You probably have to explain! In any case you begin all over again, when
he has contented himself with “Yes” or “No” you say “Do you know the
hour of your birth?” If he says “No,” you ask if he can find out, and so
on. If he says “Yes;” “Then tell me either the hour or the day and
month; but not both.” If he gives you the hour, you calculate a bit, and
say: “Then you were born on the nth of Xember, within a fortnight either
way.”<br />
If he tells you his birthday, work it out as before and then: “You were
born at P in the morning within an hour either way.” (This makes it
about 11 to 1 against your being right, in either case, on pure
chance.)<br />
Again, you can practise this in cafés, when you visit civilized
countries, and it is often possible to scrape acquaintance with people
who look especially interesting, and do not, as in England, instantly
suspect you of dishonourable advances, and get them to play up. This is
sometimes easier when you are already with that friend which I was so
lax as to allow you; and it is, I own, very helpful to discuss strange
faces if only to make it quite clear to your own mind why you decide on
one as Virgo, another as Taurus.<br />
A strange thing happened once; I had explained all this to the girl that
I happened to be living with: that is, I taught her the names of the
signs; she knew no Astrology, net even the simple correspondences. After
about a month, she was better at it than I was! (“Why strange?” you
mutter rudely. “Quite right, my dear! I have always been a wretched
reader of character. Bless my soul! there was a time when I had hopes of
you,” I savagely retort.) She had picked up the knack, the trick of it;
she could select, eliminate, recompose, compare with past experience,
and form a judgment, without knowing the names of its materials.<br />
When you have got your sea-legs at both these parts of your astrological
education, you may (I think) put out to sea with some confidence.
Perhaps a fair test of your fitness would be when you got three people
right out of four, in a total of a score or so. Well, allow for my being
in a “mood” to-night; call it two out of three. If it were guesswork,
after all, that means you are bringing it off at seven to one.<br />
Obviously, when you do go wrong, set up the figure, study it more
carefully than ever, and find out what misled you.<br />
Remember constantly that the Statistical Method is your one and only
safeguard against selfdeception.<br />
Within the limits of a letter I could hardly hope to go into matters
much more fully or deeply than I have done; but ’pon my soul! I think
that what I have said should be enough for an intelligent and assiduous
student. Let me insist that all that is worthwhile comes by experience.
Learning one thing will give you the clue to another.<br />
Well do I know to my sorrow how hard it is, as a rule, to learn how to
do a thing solely from written instruction; so perhaps you had better
arrange to see me one day about the actual setting-up of a figure.
Probably, too, there will be a few points that you would like to
discuss.<br />
I will end by betting you six clothing coupons to a pound of sugar that
in two years’ concentrated work on these lines you will become a better
astrologer than ever I was. (This is very cunning of me; in two years we
shall all be getting clothes without coupons.)</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-xxiii-improvising-a-temple">Chapter XXIII: Improvising a
Temple</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>(This letter has been provoked by points discussed in your recent
visit.)<br />
As some of your daily practices are ceremonial, it should not come amiss
to vouchsafe a few hints of practical service. For in ritual Magick, it
will of course be the first care to get everything balanced and
tidy.<br />
If you propose to erect a regular Temple, the most precise instructions
in every detail are given in Book 4, Part II. (But I haven’t so much as
seen a copy for years!) There is a good deal scattered about in Part III
(Magick, which you have) especially about the four elemental
weapons.<br />
But if circumstances deny you for the moment the means of carrying out
this Ædification as the Ideal would have it, you can certainly do your
best to create a fairly satisfactory—above all, workable—
substitute.<br />
(By the way, note the moral aspect of a house, as displayed in our
language. “Edification”—“housemaking”: from Latin Aedes, “house”.
“Economy”—“houseruling”: from the Greek “….S”, “House” and “….S”,
“law.”)<br />
I was often reduced to such expedients when wandering in strange lands,
camping on glaciers, and so on. I fixed it workably well. In Mexico,
D.F. for instance, I took my bedroom itself for the Circle, my
night-table for the Altar, my candle for the Lamp; and I made the
Weapons compact. I had a Wand eight inches long, all precious stones and
enamel, to represent the Tree of Life; within, an iron tube containing
quicksilver—very correct, lordly, and damnsilly. What a club! Also,
bought, a silver-gilt Cup; for Air and Earth I made one sachet of
rose-petals in yellow silk, and another in green silk packed with salt.
In the wilds it was easy, agreeable and most efficacious to make a
Circle, and build an altar, of stones; my Alpine Lantern served
admirably for the Lamp. It did double duty when required: e.g. in
partaking of the Sacrament of the Four Elements, it served for Fire. But
your conditions are not so restricted as this.<br />
Let us consider what one can do with an ordinary house, such as you are
happy enough to possess.<br />
First of all, it is of immense advantage to have a room specially
consecrated to the Work, never used for any other purpose, and never
entered by any other person than yourself, unless it were another
Initiate, either for inspection or in case you were working
together.<br />
The aura accumulates with the regularity and frequency of Use.<br />
The first point is the Banishing: Everything is to be removed from the
room which is not absolutely necessary to the Work.<br />
In this country, one must attend to the heating. An electric stove in
the East or the South, is best: it must not need attention. One can
usually buy stoves with excellent appropriate symbolism. (Last time I
did this—13 e.v.—I got a perfect Ferranti at Harrods. The circular
copper bowl, with the central Disk as the source of heat, is
unsurpassable.) The walls should be “self-coloured,” a neutral tint—
green, grey or blue-grey? and entirely bare, unless you put up, in the
proper quarters, the proper designs, such as the “Watch Towers”—see The
Equinox I, 7.1 Remember that your “East,” your Kiblah, is Boleskine
House, which is as near as possible due North from Plymouth. Find North
by the shadow of a vertical rod and noon, or by the Pole-Star. Work out
the angle as usual.<br />
The Stele of Revealing may be just on the N. Wall to make your
“East.”<br />
Next, your Circle. The floor ought to be “Earth” green; but white will
serve, or black. (A Masonic carpet is not at all bad.) The Circle itself
should be as shown in “Book 4”, Part II; but as this volume is probably
unavailable, ask me to show you the large painted diagram in my
portfolio when next you visit me, and we can arrange for it to be
copied.<br />
This should then be painted in the correct colours on the floor: the
Kether Square to the North, your “East.”<br />
The Altar must fit exactly the square of Tiphareth; it is best made as a
cupboard; of oak or acacia, by preference. It can then be used to hold
reserves of incense and other requisites.<br />
Note that the height of the Altar has to suit your convenience. It is
consequently in direct relation with your own stature; in proportion, it
is a double cube. This then determines the size of your circle; in fact
the entire apparatus and furniture is a geometrical function of
yourself. Consider it all as a projection of yourself in terms of these
conventional formulae. (A convention does really mean “that which is
convenient.” How abject, then to obey a self-styled convention which is
actually as inconvenient as possible!)2<br />
Next, the Lamp. This may be of silver, or silver-gilt, (to represent the
Path of Gimel) and is to be hung from the ceiling exactly above the
centre of the altar. There are plenty of old church lamps which serve
very well. The light is to be from a wick in a floating cork in a glass
of olive oil. (I hope you can get it!) It is really desirable to make
this as near the “Ever-burning Lamp of the Rosicrucians” as possible; it
is not a drawback that this implies frequent attention.<br />
Now for the Weapons!<br />
The Wand. Let this be simple, straight and slim! Have you an Almond or
Witch Hazel in your garden—or do I call it park? If so, cut (with the
magick knife—I would lend you mine) a bough, as nearly straight as
possible, about two feet long. Peel it, rub it constantly with Oil of
Abramelin (this, and his incense, from Wallis and Co., 26 New Cavendish
Street, W.1) and keep wrapped in scarlet silk, constantly, I wrote, and
meant it; rub it, when saying your mantra, to the rhythm of that
same.<br />
(Remember, “A ka dua” is the best; ask me to intone it to you when you
next visit me.)<br />
The Cup. There are plenty of chalices to be bought. It should be of
silver. If ornamented, the best form is that of the apple. I have seen
suitable cups in many shops.<br />
The Sword. The ideal form is shown in the Ace of Swords in the
Tarot.<br />
At all events, let the blade be straight, and the hilt a simple cross.
(The 32° Masonic Sword is not too bad; Kenning or Spencer in Great Queen
Street, W.C.2 stock them—or used to do.)<br />
The Disk. This ought to be of pure gold, with your own Pantacle,
designed by yourself after prolonged study, graved thereupon. While
getting ready for this any plain circle of gold will have to serve your
turn. Quite flat, of course. If you want a good simple design to go on
interim, try the Rosy Cross or the Unicursal Hexagram.<br />
So much for the Weapons! Now, as to your personal accoutrements, Robe,
Lamen, Sandals and the like, The Book of the Law has most thoughtfully
simplified matters for us. “I charge you earnestly to come before me in
a single robe, and covered with a rich headdress.” (AL I, 61) The Robe
may well be in the form of the Tau Cross; i.e. expanding from axilla to
ankle, and from shoulder to—whatever you call the place where your hands
come out. (Shape well shown in the illustration Magick face p. 360). You
being a Probationer, plain black is correct3; and the Unicursal Hexagram
might be embroidered, or “applique” (is it? I mean “stuck on”), upon the
breast. The best headdress is the Nemyss: I cannot trust myself to
describe how to make one, but there are any number of models in the
British Museum, on in any Illustrated Hieroglyphic text. The Sphinx
wears one, and there is a photograph, showing the shape and structure
very clearly, in the Equinox I, 1, frontispiece to Supplement. You can
easily make one yourself out of silk; broad black-and-white stripes is a
pleasing design. Avoid “artistic” complexities.<br />
Well, that ought to be enough to keep you out of mischief for a little
while; but I feel moved to add a line of caution and
encouragement.<br />
Listen!<br />
Faites attention!<br />
Achtung!<br />
Khabardar karo!<br />
Just as soon as you start seriously to prepare a place for magical Work,
the world goes more cockeyed than it is already. Don’t be surprised if
you find that six weeks’ intense shopping all over London fails to
provide you with some simple requisite that normally you could buy in
ten minutes.<br />
Perhaps your fires simply refuse to burn, even when liberally dosed with
petrol and phosphorus, with a handful of Chlorate of Potash thrown in
just to show there is no ill feeling! When you have almost decided that
you had better make up your mind to do without something that seems
really quite unobtainable—say, a sixty-carat diamond which would look so
well on the head-dress—a perfect stranger comes along and makes you a
present of one. Or, a long series of quite unreasonable obstacles or
silly accidents interfere with your plans: or, the worst difficulty in
your way is incomprehensibly removed by some extraordinary “freak of
chance.” Or, . . . In a word, you seem to have strolled into a world
where—well, it might be going too far to say that the Law of Cause and
Effect is suspended; but at least the Law of Probability seems to be
playing practical jokes on you.<br />
This means that your manoeuvres have somehow attracted the notice of the
Astral Plane: your new neighbours (May I call them?) are taking an
interest in the latest Tenderfoot, some to welcome, to do all they can
to help you to settle down, others indignant or apprehensive at this
disturbance of routine. This is where your Banishings and Invocations
come to the rescue. Of course, I am not here referring to the approach
to Sanctuaries which of necessity are closely guarded, but merely to the
recognition of a new-comer to that part of the world in general.<br />
Of course all these miracles are very naughty of you; they mean that
your magical power has sprung a few small leaks; at least, the water is
oozing between some planks not sealed as Hermetically as they should be.
But oh and this is naughtier still—it is a blessed, blessed comfort that
they happen, that chance, coincidence and all the rest will simply not
explain it all away, that your new vision of life is not a dream, but
part and parcel of Experience for evermore, a real as any other
manifestation of Reality through sense such as is common to all
men.<br />
And this brings us—it has been a long way round—from the suggestion of
your visit to the question (hitherto unanswered) in your letter.<br />
You raise so vast and razor-edged a question when you write of the
supposed antinomy of “soul” and “sense” that it seemed better to
withhold comment until this later letter; much meditation was most
needful to compress the answer within reasonable limits; even to give it
form at all is no easy matter.<br />
For this is probably the symptom of the earliest stirring of the mind of
the cave-man to reflection, thereunto moved by other symptoms—those of
the morning after following upon the night before. It is—have we not
already dealt with that matter after a fashion?—evidence of disease when
an organ becomes aware of its own modes of motion. Certainly the mere
fact of questioning Life bears witness to some interruption of its flow,
just as a ripple on an even stream tells of a rock submerged. The
fiercer the torrent and the bigger the obstacle, the greater the
disturbance to the surface—have I not seen them in the Bralduh eight
feet high? Lethargic folk with no wild impulse of Will may get through
Life in bovine apathy; we may well note that (in a sense) the rage of
the water seems to our perturbed imagining actually to increase and
multiply the obstructions; there is a critical point beyond which the
ripples fight each other!<br />
That, in short, is a picture of you!<br />
You have mistaken the flurry of passing over some actual snag for a snag
in itself! You put the blame on to your own quite rational attempts to
overcome difficulties. he secret of the trick of getting past the rocks
is elasticity; yet it is that very quality with which you reproach
yourself!<br />
We even, at the worst, reach the state for which Buddhism, in the East
presents most ably the case: as in the West, does James Thomson (B.V.)
in The City of Dreadful Night; we come to wish for—or, more truly to
think that we wish for “blest Nirvana’s sinless stainless Peace” (or
some such twaddle—thank God I can’t recall Arnold’s mawkish and unmanly
phrase!) and B.V.’s “Dateless oblivion and<br />
divine repose.”<br />
I insist on the “think that you wish,” because, if the real You did
really wish the real That, you could never have come to exist at all!
(“But I don’t exist.”—“I know—let’s get on!”)<br />
Note, please, how sophistically unconvincing are the Buddhist theories
of how we ever got into this mess. First cause: Ignorance. Way out,
then, knowledge. O.K., that implies a knower, a thing known—and so on
and so forth, thought all the Three Waste Paper Baskets of the Law;
analysed, it turns out to be nonsense all dolled up to look like
thinking. And there is no genuine explanation of the origin of the Will
to be.<br />
How different, how simple, how self-evident, is the doctrine of The Book
of the Law!<br />
There are any number of passages dealing with this matter in my
writings: let’s forget them, and keep to the Text!<br />
Cap. I, v. 26 “. . my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity of
existence, the omnipresence of my body.”<br />
V. 30 “This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is
as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.” (There is a Qabalistic
inner meaning in this text; “the pain,” for instance, . ..G.S, may be
read XVII × 22 “the expression of Star-love,” and so on: all too
complicated for this time and place!)<br />
V. 32. “Then the joys of my love” (i.e. the fulfilment of all possible
experiences) “will redeem ye from all pain.”<br />
V. 58. “I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while
in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; . . .” Cap. II,
v. 9 “Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows
are but as shadows; they pass &amp; are done; but there is that which
remains.”<br />
(The continuation is amusing! vv. 10 and 11 read:<br />
O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing. I see thee hate the
hand &amp; the pen; but I am stronger.<br />
At that time I was a hard-shell Buddhist, sent out a New Year’s Card
“wishing you a speedy termination of existence!” And this as a young
man, with the world at my feet. It only goes to show .<br />
. . . .)<br />
Vv. 19, 20. “Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. .
. . Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force
and fire, are of us.”<br />
This chapter returns over and over again to this theme in one form or
another.<br />
What is really more significant is the hidden, the unexpressed, soul of
the Book; the way in which it leaps into wild spate of rhapsody on any
excuse or no excuse.<br />
This is surely more convincing than some dreary thesis plodding along
doggedly with the “proof” (!) that “God is good,” every sentence
creaking with your chalk-stones and squeaking with the twinges of your
toe!<br />
Yet just because I proclaim a doctrine of joy in the language of joy,
people—dull camels—say I am not “serious.”<br />
Yet I have found pleasure in harnessing the winged horses of the Sun to
the ploughshare of Reason, in showing the validity of this doctrine in
detail. It satisfies my sense of rhythm and of symmetry to explain that
every experience, no matter what, must of necessity be a gain of
grandeur, of grip, of comprehension and enjoyment ever growing as
complexity and simplicity succeed each other in sublime systole and
diastole, in strophe and antistrophe chanting against each other to the
stars of the Night and of the Morning!<br />
“Peace”: the glow of satisfaction at achievement. It is not “eternal,”
rather, it whets the appetite for another adventure. (Peace, . …… = 189
= 7 × 9 × 3, the Venusian plus Lunar form of Unity.)4 Of course it is
easy as pie to knock all this to pieces by “lunatic logic,” saying:
“Then toothache is really as pleasant as strawberry shortcake:” You are
hereby referred to Eight Lectures on Yoga. None of the terms I am using
have been, or can be defined. All my propositions amount to no more than
tautology: A. is A. You may even quote The Book of the Law itself: “Now
a curse upon Because and his kin! . . . . Enough of Because! Be he
damned for a dog!” (AL II 28-33). These things stink of Ignoratio
Elenchi, or something painfully like it: as sort of slipping up a cog,
of “confusing the planes” of wilfully misunderstanding the gist of an
argument. (All magicians, by the way, ought to be grounded solidly in
Formal Logic.)<br />
Never forget, at the least, how simple it is to make a maniac’s
hell-broth of any proposition, however plain to common sense.<br />
All the above, now:—Buddhism refuted. Yet it is a possibility and
therefore one facet of Truth. “Rest” is an idea: so immobility is one of
the moving states. A certain state of mind is (almost by definition)
“eternal,” yet it most assuredly begins and ends.<br />
And so on for ever—I fear it would be nugatory, pleonastic (and oh!
several other lovely long adjectives!) to try to guard you from these
hydra-headed and protean booby-traps; you must tackle them yourself as
they arise, and deal with them as best you can: always remembering that
often enough you cannot tell which is you and which is the Monkey
Puzzle, or who has won. (“Everybody’s won; so everybody must have a
prize” applies beautifully). And none of it all matters a row of
haricots verts sautés; for the conclusion must always be Doubt (see that
beastly Book of Lies again—there’s a gorgeous chapter about it 6) and
the practical moral is this: these contradictions don’t occur (or don’t
matter) in Neschamah.<br />
Also, it might help you quite a lot (by encouraging you when depressed,
or amusing you when you want to relax) to read Sir Palamede the Saracen;
Supplement to The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 4. I expect quite a few of his
tragi-comic misadventures will be already familiar to you in one
disguise or another.<br />
And if the above remarks should embolden you to exclaim: “Perhaps a
little drink would do me no great harm” I shall feel that I have
deserved well of my country!<br />
For—see Liber Aleph, after Rabelais—the Word of the Last Oracle is
TRINC. 5<br />
This plaint of yours tails off—and perks up in so doing—with confession
of Ambition, and considerations of what you must leave over to your next
life. Very right! but all that is covered by your general programme. It
is proper to assimilate these ideas with the fundamental structure of
your mind: “Perhaps I had better leave ‘The Life and opinion of Battling
Bill, the Ballarat Bruiser’ till, shall we say, six incarnations
ahead”—But perhaps you have acquired that already.<br />
No, better still, concentrate on the Next Step! After all, it is the
only one you can take, isn’t it!<br />
Without lust of result, please!<br />
And I shall leave anything else to the next letter.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. “Next letter,” yes, they are running into one another more than
somewhat; it is better so, for life is like that. And we have the bold
bad editor to sort them out.<br />

brief abstract of the symbolic representation of the Universe as derived
by Dr John Dee from the skrying of Sir Edward Kelly.”<br />
2: The Circle described in Book 4 part II has an overall diameter of
about 17 times the side of each square comprising the Tau (this assumes
the distance between the inner and outer circle is about the same as the
side of each square). The double cube altar is traditionally 44 inches
high (about navel height on a six foot person) which will make the
circle over 30 feet in diameter. This might be possible if you have the
use of a small sports hall; it will not fit in most peoples’ living
rooms – T.S.<br />
3: The robe of a Probationer, as can be deduced from photographs of the
Rites of Eleusis and references in The Vision and the Voice and other
writings of the Equinox period, was originally conceived of as white
with no hood, a pentagram on the breast and the “Hexagram of Nature”
(red triangle ascending, blue triangle descending, golden Tau in the
centre) on the back – T.S.<br />
4: The transcript gave the factorisation as 7 times 9 times 13; this is
wrong, but the analysis (“unity” is Qabalistically referred to 13)
suggests it may have been a slip by Crowley rather than a transcription
error) – T.S.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-xxiv-necromancy-and-spiritism">Chapter XXIV: Necromancy
and Spiritism</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Really, you make me ashamed of You! To write to ignorant me to wise
you up about necromancy, when you have at your elbow the one supreme
classic—Lévi’s Chapter XIII in the Dogme et Rituel!<br />
What sublimity of approach! What ingenuity of “considerations!” With
what fatally sure steps marches his preparation! With what superb
technique does he carry out his energised enthusiasm!<br />
And, finally, with what exact judicial righteousness does he sum the
results of his great Evocation of Apollonius of Tyana!<br />
Contrast with this elaborate care, rightness of every detail,
earnestness and intentness upon the goal—contrast, I say, the modern
Spiritist in the dingy squalor of her foul back street in her suburban
slum, the room musty, smelling of stale food, the hideous prints, the
cheap and rickety furniture, calling up any one required from Jesus
Christ to Queen Victoria, all at a bob-a-nob!<br />
Faugh! Let us return to clean air, and analyse Lévi’s experiment; I
believe that by the application of the principles set forth in my other
letters on Death and Reincarnation, it will be simple to explain his
partial failure to evoke Apollonius. You had better read them over
again, to have the matter clear and fresh in your mind.<br />
Now then, let me call your attention to the extreme care which Lévi took
to construct a proper Magical Link between himself and the Ancient
Master. Alas! It was rather a case of building with bricks made without
straw; he had not at his command any fresh and vital object pertaining
intimately to Apollonius. A “relic” would have been immensely helpful,
especially if it had been consecrated and reconsecrated through the
centuries by devout veneration. This, incidentally, is the great
advantage that one may often obtain when invoking Gods; their images,
constantly revered, nourished by continual sacrifice, serve as a
receptacle for the Prana driven into them by thousands or millions of
worshippers. In fact, such idols are often already consecrated
talismans; and their possession and daily use is at least two-thirds of
the battle.<br />
Apollonius was indeed as refractory a subject as Lévi could possibly
have chosen. All the cards were against him.<br />
Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, by Eliphas Lévi.<br />
Why? Let me remind you of the sublimity of the man’s genius, and the
extent of his attainment.<br />
Apollonius must certainly have made the closest links between his Ruach
and his Supernal Triad, and this would have gone seeking a new
incarnation elsewhere. All the available Ruach left floating around in
the Akasha must have been comparatively worthless odds and ends, true
Qlippoth or “Shells of the Dead”—just those parts of him, in a word,
which Apollonius would have deliberately discarded at his death.<br />
So what use would they be to Lévi? Even if there were among them a few
such elements as would serve his purpose, they would have been
devitalised and frittered away by the mere lapse of the centuries, since
they had lost connection with the reality of the Sage. Alternatively,
they might have been caught up and adopted by some wandering Entity,
quite probably some malignant demon.<br />
Qlipoth—Shells of the Dead—Obsessing Spirits! Here we are back in the
pestilent purlieus of Waltham Green, and the frowsty atmosphere of the
frowsy “medium” and the squalid séance. “Look! but do not speak to
them!” as Virgil warned Dante.<br />
So let us look.<br />
No! Let us first congratulate ourselves that this subject of Necromancy
is so admirably documented.<br />
As to the real Art, we have not only Eliphas Lévi, but the sublimely
simple account in the Old Testament of the Witch of Endor, her conjuring
up of the apparition of Samuel to King Saul. A third classic must not be
neglected: I have heard or read the story elsewhere—for the moment I
cannot place it. But it is so brilliantly told in I Write as I Please by
Walter Duranty that nothing could be happier than to quote him
verbatim.<br />
It was the story of a Bolshevik who conversed with a corpse. He told it
to me himself, and undoubtedly believed it, although he was an average
tough Bolshevik who naturally disbelieved in Heaven and Hell and a Life
beyond the Grave. This man was doing ‘underground’ revolutionary work in
St. Petersburg when the War broke out; but he was caught by the police
and exiled to the far north of Siberia. In the second winter of the War
he escaped from his prison camp and reached an Eskimo<br />
village where they gave him shelter until the spring. They lived, he
said, in beastly conditions, and the only one whom he could talk to was
the Shaman, or medicine man, who knew a little Russian.<br />
The Shaman once boasted that he could foretell the future, which my
Bolshevik friend ridiculed. The next day the Shaman took him to a cave
in the side of a hill in which there was a big transparent block of ice
enclosing the naked body of a man—a white man, not a native—apparently
about thirty years of age with no sign of a wound anywhere. The man’s
head, which was clean-shaven, was outside the block of ice; the eyes
were closed and the features were European. The shaman then lit a fire
and burnt some leaves, threw powder on them muttering incantations, and
there was a heavy aromatic smoke. He said in Russian to the Bolshevik,
‘Ask what you want to know.’ The Bolshevik spoke in German; he was sure
that the Shaman knew no German, but he was equally sure he saw the lips
move and heard it answer, clearly, in German.<br />
He asked what would happen to Russia, and what would happen to him. From
the moving lips of the corpse came the reply that Russia would be
defeated in war and that there would be a revolution; the Tsar would be
captured by his enemies and killed on the eve of rescue; he, the
Bolshevik, would fight in the Revolution but would suffer no harm;
later, he would be wounded fighting a foreign enemy, but would recover
and live long.<br />
The Bolshevik did not really believe what he had seen although he was
certain that he had seen it. I mean that he explained it by hypnotism or
auto suggestion or something of the kind; but it was true, he said, that
he passed unscathed through the Revolution and the Civil War and was
wounded in the Polish War when the Red Army recovered Kiev.<br />
So also we are most fortunate in possessing the account almost beyond
Heart’s desire of Spiritism, in Robert Browning’s Mr Sludge the Medium.
You see that I write “Spiritism” not “Spiritualism.” To use the latter
word in this connection is vulgar ignorance; it denotes a system of
philosophy which flourished (more or less) is the Middle Ages—read your
Erdmann if you want the gruesome details.<br />
But why should you?<br />
The model for Mr Sludge was David Dunbar Home1, who was really quite a
distinguished person in his way, and succeeded in pulling some
remarkably instructed and blue-blooded legs. Personally, I believe him
to have been genuine, getting real results through pacts with
elementals, demons or what not; for when he was in Paris, arrangements
were made for him to meet Eliphas Lévi; forthwith “he<br />
abandoned the unequal contest, and fled in terror from the accursed
spot.”<br />
What annoyed Browning was that he had added to his collection of “Femora
I have pulled”, those appendages of Elizabeth Barrett; and where R.B.
was there was no room for anyone else—as in the case of Allah!<br />
R.B. was accordingly as spiteful as he could be, and that was not a
little. It is not fair to tar all mediums with the Sludge brush; there
are many who could advance quite sincerely some of the apologia of
Sludge. Why should a medium be immune to self-deception spurred by the
Wish-Fiend?<br />
While there are people walking about outside the Bug-house who can find
Mrs Simpson and Generals de Gaulle, Franco, Allenby, Montgomery and who
else in the “Centuries” of Nostradamus, we should be stupid to assign
everything to conscious fraud.<br />
In that case what about poor Tiny Aleister? Do please allow me the happy
young Eagles of the Old Testament; what clearer prophecy of
psychoanalysis, it’s only the English for Freud and Jung and
Adler!<br />
No, by no means always fraud. Yet at any séance the “investigators” take
no magical precautions soever—against, say, the impersonation of Iophiel
by Hismael, or the Doves of Venus by the A’arab Zareq. All they attempt
especially at “demonstrations” and “materialisations,” is to guard with
great elaboration and (as a rule) complete futility against the
deceptions of the common conjuror. They are not expecting any genuine
manifestation of the “Spirit World;” and this fact makes clear their
true subconscious attitude.<br />
As for those mediums who possess magical ability, they almost always
come from the most ignorant classes—Celts are an exception to this
rule—and have no knowledge whatever of the technique of the business.
Worse, they are usually of the type that delights in the secret dirty
affinities, and so naturally and gladly attract entities of the
Qliphothic world to their magical circle. Hence tricksters, of the
lowest elemental orders, at the best, come and vitalise odds and ends of
the Ruach of people recently deceased, and perform astonishing
impersonations. The hollow shells glow with infernal fire.<br />
Also, of course, they soak up vitality from the sitters, and from the
medium herself.<br />
Altogether, a most poisonous performance. And what do they get out of
it? Even when the “Spirits” are really spirits, they only stuff the
party up with a lot of trashy lies. To this summary the Laws of
Probability insist that there shall be occasional exceptions.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

id="chapter-xxv-fascinations-invisibility-levitation-transmutations-kinks-in-time">Chapter
XXV: Fascinations, Invisibility, Levitation, Transmutations, “Kinks in
Time”</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Dear me! dear me! The world’s indeed gone topsy-turvy if you have to
ask me for the secrets of Fascination! Altogether tohu-bohu and the
Temurah Thash raq!1<br />
So much for a display of Old-World Courtly Manners; actually rubbish,
for you might very well be fascinating without knowing how you worked
the trick. In fact, I think that is the case ninety-nine times in a
hundred. Besides, I read your letter carelessly; I overlooked the phrase
in which you mention that you use the word as Lévi did; i.e. to cover
all those types of “miracle” which depend on distracting the attention
of, or otherwise composing, the miraclee—I invent a rather useful word,
yes?<br />
So let us see what sort of miracles those are.<br />
To start with, I doubt if we can. Many of such thaumaturgic phenomena
contain elements of illusion in greater or less degree; if the
miraclee’s mind is 100% responsible, I think the business becomes a mere
conjuring trick.<br />
My dictionary defines the verb: “to charm, to enchant; to act on by some
irresistible influence; to captivate; to excite and allure irresistibly
or powerfully.”<br />
For the noun it gets even deeper into technical Magic: “the act or power
of fascinating or spell binding, often to one’s harm; a mysterious,
irresistible, alluring influence.” (Personally, I have always used, or
heard, it much less seriously: “attractive” hardly more). Skeat,
surprisingly, is almost dumb: p. part. of “to enchant” and “from L.
fascinum, a spell.”<br />
Yes, surprisingly; for the word is one of the many that means the
Phallus. The implication is that there is some sexual element in the
exciting and alluring quality, which lifts it altogether above mere
“pleasing.”<br />
To my mind the implication is that there is some quality inherent which
is cognate to that too totally irrational quasimagnetic force which has
been responsible not only for innumerable personal tragedies—and
comedies—but for the fall of dynasties and even the wreck of
Empires.<br />
“Christ” is reported as having said: “If I be lifted up from the earth,
I will draw all men unto me.”<br />
Interpret this in the light of the Cross as a Phallic emblem, and—how
lurid a flash!<br />
Compare AL II, 26. “I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in
my coiling there is joy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If
I droop down mine head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture of the
earth, and I and the earth are one.”<br />
This versicle is deep, devilish deep; and it is chock-a-block with the
mysteries of Fascination. Dig into this, dear sister! dig with your
Qabalistic trowel; don’t blame me if you don’t get a Mandrake with the
very first thrust!<br />
But most certainly I shall say nothing here. Yes, indeed, nothing was
ever more sternly forbidden than prattle on subjects like this! Look! It
goes right on: “There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand
these runes shall make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit
called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.” (v.
27) The pit is of course the Abyss: see The Vision and the Voice, Xth
Aethyr. A very sticky—or rather, unstuck! finish; so ’ware Hawk!<br />
To business! Fascination No! Invisibility, is obviously penny plain
S.A.<br />
This is notably an affair of the subconscious; it often masters open
dislike and distaste; it never yields to reason. It destroys all sense
of values. Its origin is usually obscure. The least irrational base of
it is the sense of smell. It was, if I remember rightly, the Comte de
St. Germain who advised Loise de la Valliêre to fix her exquisitely
broidered kerchief in such wise that it protected her from contact with
her saddle, and then, after a morning’s hard gallop, to find an excuse
for using it to wipe the brows of the perspiring king. It took him years
to recover! The story is well known, and the plan widely adopted with
remarkably unvarying success. But be careful not to overdo it; for if
the source of the perfume is recognized the consciousness takes charge,
and the result is antipathy.<br />
Many years ago I composed a scent based on similar principles, which I
intended to market under the title “Potted Sex Appeal.” We tried it out
with the assistance of a certain noble Marquess, whose consequent
misadventures—won’t he laugh when he reads this!<br />
But there are other senses: “l’amour de l’oreille” may refer not only to
Othello’s way of snaring Desdemona, but subtleties of timbre in the
voice…<br />
Yes, yes, you say impatiently, but there isn’t any miracle about all
this in the ordinary sense of the word.<br />
True, but why the devil do you want me, so long as you’re getting what
you need? Just being childlike, I suppose! No? Merely that you can
explain such matters to yourself well enough. All right; on to No. 2.
Shall we look at levitation for a change?<br />
This power—if it be one—is very curious indeed. It connects more
directly with magnetism than almost any other. The first thing we think
of when someone says “magnet” is picking up iron filings as a
child.<br />
Age before honesty! Let Father Poulain S.J. speak first! He is obliged
to admit the phenomenon, because the Church has done so. But precisely
similar accounts of the levitation of pagans and heretics must be
according to him, lies, or Works of the Devil. As for the method, “God
employs the angels to raise the saint, so as to avoid the necessity of
intervening Himself.” Lazy old parishioner!<br />
Now for a douche of common sense. Hatha-Yoga is quite clear and simple,
even logical, about it.<br />
The method is plain Pranayama. Didn’t I tell you onetime of the Four
Stages of Success? 1.—Perspiration—of a very special kind.— 2.
Sukshma-Khumbakam: automatic rigidity. One stiffens like a dog in a
bell-jar when you pump in Carbon Dioxide (is it?) 3. The
Bhuchari-Siddhi, “jumping about like a frog.” One is wafted, without
one’s Asana being disturbed, about the floor, rather as fragments of
paper, or dry leaves, might be in a slight draught under the door. 4. If
one is quite perfectly balanced one cannot be moved sideways; so one
rises. And there you are! Personally, I reached the Bhuchari-Siddhi
quite a number of times; but I never observed No. 4. On several
occasions other people have seen me levitated, though never to a height
of more than a foot or so. Here is the best account of such an incident,
of those at my immediate disposal.<br />
Nearly midnight. At this moment we stopped dictating, and began to
converse. Then Fra. P. said: “Oh, if I could only dictate a book like
the Tao Teh King!” Then he closed his eyes as if meditating.<br />
Just before I had noticed a change in his face, most extraordinary, as
if he were no longer the same person; in fact, in the ten minutes we
were talking he seemed to be any number of different people.<br />
I especially noticed the pupils of his eyes were so enlarged that the
entire eye seemed black. (I tremble so and have such a quaking feeling
inside, simply in thinking of last night, that I can’t form letters).
Then quite slowly the entire room filled with a thick yellow light (deep
golden, but not brilliant. I mean not dazzling, but soft.) Fra. P.
Looked like a person I had never seen but seemed to know quite well—his
face, clothes and all were of the same yellow. I was so disturbed that I
looked up to the ceiling to see what caused the light, but could only
see the candles. Then the chair on which he sat seemed to rise; it was
like a throne, and he seemed to rise; it was like a throne, and he
seemed to be either dead or sleeping; but it was certainly no longer
Fra. P. This frightened me, and I tried to understand by looking round
the room; when I looked back the chair was raised, and he was still the
same. I realised I was alone; and thinking he was dead or gone—or some
other terrible thing—I lost consciousness.<br />
This discourse has been thus left unfinished: but it is only necessary
to add that the capacity to extract such spiritual honey from these
unpromising flowers is the mark of an adept who has perfected his Magick
Cup. This method of Qabalistic exegesis is one of he best ways of
exalting the reason to the higher consciousness. Evidently it started
Fra. P. so that in a moment he became completely concentrated and
entranced.2<br />
Note that this has nothing at all to do with any Pranayama. It seems a
matter of ecstatic concentration, which chose this mode of expression
instead of bringing on Samadhi—though that, too, occurred in some of the
cases.<br />
By the way, there is a fairly full account of the whole business; I have
just remembered—it is in my Autohagiography.<br />
Pranayama produced, firstly, a peculiar kind of perspiration; secondly,
an automatic rigidity of the muscles; and thirdly, the very curious
phenomenon of causing the body, while still absolutely rigid, to take
little hops in various directions. It seems as if one were somehow
raised, possibly an inch from the ground, and deposited very gently a
short distance away.<br />
I saw a very striking case of this at Kandy. When Allan was meditating,
it was my duty to bring his food very quietly (from time to time) into
the room adjoining that where he was working. One day he missed two
successive meals, and I thought I ought to look into his room to see if
all was well. I must explain that I have known only two European women
and three European men who could sit in the attitude called Padmasana,
which is that usually seen in seated images of the Buddha. Of these men,
Allan was one. He could knot his legs so well that, putting his hands on
the ground, he could swing his body to and fro in the air between them.
When I looked into his room I found him not seated on his meditation
mat, which was in the centre of the room at the end farthest from the
window, but in a distant corner ten or twelve feet off, still in his
knotted position, resting on his head and right shoulder, exactly like
an image overturned. I set him right way up, and he came out of his
trance. He was quite unconscious that anything unusual had happened. But
he had evidently been thrown there by the mysterious forces generated by
Pranayama.<br />
There is no doubt whatever about this phenomenon; it is quite common.
But the Yogis claim that the lateral motion is due to lack of balance,
and that if one were in perfect spiritual equilibrium one would rise
directly in the air. I have never seen any case of levitation, and
hesitate to say that it has happened to me, thought I have actually been
seen by others, on several occasions, apparently poised in the air. For
the first three phenomena I have found no difficulty in devising quite
simple physiological explanations. But I can form no theory as to how
the practice could counteract the force of gravitation, and I am
unregenerate enough to allow this to make me sceptical about the
occurrence of levitation.<br />
Yet, after all, the stars are suspended in space. There is no à priori
reason why the forces which prevent them rushing together should not
come into operation in respect of the earth and the body.<br />
The Allan part of this is the best evidence at my disposal. He couldn’t
have got where he did by hopping, and he couldn’t have got into that
position intentionally; he must have been levitated, lost balance, and
dropped upside down. In any case, there is no trace of fascination about
it, as there may have been in Soror Virakam’s observation.<br />
About invisibility, now? Of this I have so much experience that the
merest outline could take us far beyond the limits of a letter. In
Mexico D.F., I worked at acquiring the power by means of ritual. I
worked desperately hard. I got to the point where my image in a
pier-glass flickered, rather like the very earliest films did. Possibly
more work, after more skill had come to me, might have done the whole
trick. But I did not persist when I found out how to do it by
fascination. (Here we are at last!)<br />
Roughly, this is how to do it. If one is concentrated to the point when
what you are thinking of is the only reality in the Universe, when you
lose all awareness of who and where you are and what you are doing, it
seems as though that unconsciousness were in some way contagious. The
people around you just can’t see anybody.<br />
At one time, in Sicily, this happened nearly every day. Our party,
strolling down to our bathing bay—the loveliest spot of its kind that I
have ever seen—over a hillside where there wasn’t cover for a rabbit,
would lose sight of me, look, and fail to find me, though I was walking
in their midst. At first, astonishment, bewilderment; at last, so normal
had it become: “He’s invisible again.”<br />
One incident I remember very vividly indeed; an old friend and I were
sitting opposite each other in armchairs in front of a large fire,
smoking our pipes. Suddenly he lost sight of me, and actually cried out
in alarm. I said: “What’s wrong?” That broke the spell; there I was, all
present and correct.<br />
Did I hear you mutter “Transmutations? Werewolves? Golden Hawks?” Likely
enough; it’s time we touched on that.<br />
In certain types of animal there appears, if tradition has any weight,
to be a curious quality of—sympathy? I doubt if that be the word, but
can think of none better—which enables them to assume at times the human
form. No. 1—and the rest are also rans—is the seal. There is a whole
body of literature about this. Then come wolves, hyenas, large dogs of
the hunting type; occasionally leopards. Tales of cats and serpents are
usually the other way round; it is the human (nearly always female) that
assumes these shapes by witchcraft. But in ancient Egypt they literally
doted on this sort of thing. The papyri are full of formulas for
operating such transmutations. But I think that this was mostly to
afford some relaxation for the spirit of the dead man; he nipped out of
his sarcophagus, and painted the town all the colours of the rainbow in
one animal shape or another.<br />
The only experience I have of anything of this sort was when I was in
Pacific waters, mostly at Honolulu or in Nippon. I was practising Astral
projection. A sister of the Order who lived in Hong Kong helped me. I
was to visit her, and the token of perfect success was to be that I
should knock a vase off the mantel-piece. We appointed certain days and
hours—with some awkwardness, as my time-distance from her was constantly
growing shorter—for me to pay my visit. We got some remarkable results;
our records of the interview used to tally with surprising accuracy; but
the vase remained intact!<br />
This is not one of my notorious digressions; and this is how
transmutation comes into it. I found that by first taking the shape of a
golden hawk, and resuming my own form after landing in her “temple”—a
room she had fitted ad hoc—the whole operation became incomparably
easier. I shall not indulge in hypotheses of why this should have been
the case.<br />
A little over four years later—in the meantime we had met and worked at
Magick together—we resumed these experiments in a somewhat different
form. The success was much greater; but though I could move her, and
even any objects which she was touching, I could make no impression on
inanimate objects at a distance from her. The behaviour of her dogs, and
of her cat, was very curious and interesting. Strangest of all, there
appeared those “kinks in Time” which profane science is just beginning
to discuss. Example: on one occasion our records of an “interview”
agreed with quite extraordinary precision; but, on comparing notes, it
was found that owing to some stupid miscalculation of mine, it was all
over in Hong Kong some hours before I had started from Honolulu!<br />
Again, don’t ask me why, or how, or anything!<br />
Talking of kinks in Time, I shall now maintain my aforesaid evil
notoriety—the story is totally asynartete from fascinations of whatever
variety—by recounting what is by far the most inexplicable set of facts
that ever came my way.<br />
In the summer of 1910 e.v. I was living at 125 Victoria Street, in a
studio converted into a Temple by means of a Circle, an Altar and the
rest. West of the Altar was a big fireplace with a fender settee; the
East wall was covered with bookshelves. Enter the late Theodor Reuss,
O.H.O. and Frater Superior of the O.T.O. He wanted me to join that
Order. I recommended him, in politer language to repeat the Novocastrian
Experiment. Undeterred, he insisted: “But you must.” (Now we go back, or
forward, I know not which, to a night when I found myself stranded in
London.<br />
I asked hospitality of a stranger; it was readily afforded. Some hours
later my hostess fell asleep; I could not do so; something was nagging
me. I suddenly took my notebook, and wrote a certain passage in a
certain book, since published.)3<br />
“Must, my foot!” He persisted: “You have published the secret of the 9th
degree of O.T.O., and you must take the corresponding oaths.” “I have
done nothing of the sort. I don’t know the secret. I don’t want to know
it. I don’t . . .” He interrupted me; he strode across the room; he
plucked a book from the shelves; he opened it; he thrust it under my
nose; he pointed out a passage with a minatory index. I began to
stammer. “Yes, I wrote that. I don’t know what it means; I don’t like
it; I only put it in because it was written in rather curious
circumstances, and I was too lazy—or perhaps a little afraid—to reject
it and write what I wanted.” He fastened on one point: “You don’t know
what it means?” I repeated that I did not, even now that he had claimed
it as important. He explained it to me, as to a child. I was merely
surprised; it didn’t sound possible. (Sister, all this while I’ve been
lying to you like an Archbishop; it is connected with fascinations;
indeed, it has very little to do with anything else!)<br />
Finally, he won me over, I went down to his G.H.Q., took the Oaths, was
installed in the Throne of the X° of O.T.O. as National Sovereign Grand
Master General, and began to establish the Order as a going
concern.<br />
Well, you say, that is a very simple story, nothing specially hard to
believe in it.<br />
True, but consider the dates.<br />
That scene in Victoria Street, is as clear and vivid in my mind, in
every detail, as if it were yesterday.<br />
That secret is published only in that passage of that book. And—the book
was not published until three years later, and from an address of which
in 1910 I had not so much as thought of. The date of my adhesion to the
O.T.O. (which, by the way, upset every principle and plan that I had
ever held) is equally certain by virtue of subsequent published
writings.4<br />
Now go away and explain that!<br />
Well I’ve given you a fair account of some of the principal
fascinations; as to the rest, bewitchments, sorceries, inhibitions and
all that lot, it is enough if I say that they follow the regular Laws of
Magick; in some, fascination proper plays a prominent part; in others,
it is barely more than walking on to say “My lord, the carriage waits!”
But—even that can be done well or ill, and a small mistake may work a
mighty mischief.</p>

XXVI: Mental Processes—Two Only are Possible</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>“Occult” science is the most difficult of them all. For one thing,
its subject-matter includes the whole of philosophy, from ontology and
metaphysics down to natural history. More, the most rarefied and
recondite of these has a direct bearing upon the conduct of life in its
most material details, and the simplest study of such apparently
earthbound matters as botany and mineralogy leads to the most abstruse
calculations of the imponderables.<br />
With what weapons, then, are we to attack so formidable a
fortress?<br />
The first essential is clear thinking.<br />
In a previous letter I have dealt to some extent with this subject; but
it is so important that you must forgive me if I return to it, and that
at length, from the outset, and in detail.<br />
Let us begin but having our own minds clear of all ambiguities, ignoring
for the purpose of this argument all metaphysical subtleties. I want to
confine it to the outlook of the “plain man.”<br />
What do we do when we “think?”<br />
There are two operations, and only two, possible to thought. However
complex a statement may appear, it can always be reduced to a series of
one or other of these. If not, it is a sham statement; nonsense
masquerading as sense in the cloak of verbiage and verbosity.<br />
Analysis, and Synthesis; or, Subtraction, and Addition.<br />
1. You can examine A, and find that it is composed of B and C. A = B +
C.<br />
2. You can find out what happens to B when you add C to it. B + C =
A.<br />
As you notice, the two are identical, after all; but the process is
different.<br />
Example: Raise Copper Oxide to a very high temperature; you obtain
metallic copper and oxygen gas.<br />
Heat copper in a stream of oxygen; you obtain copper oxide.<br />
You can complicate such experiments indefinitely, as when one analyses
coal-tar, or synthesises complex products like quinine from its
elements; but one can always describe what happens as a series of simple
operations, either of the analytical or the synthetic type.<br />
(I wonder if you remember a delightful passage in Anatole France where
he interprets an “exalted” mystical statement, first by giving the words
their meaning as concrete images, when he gets a magnificent hymn, like
a passage from the Rig-Veda; secondly, by digging down to the original
meaning, with an effect comical and even a little ribald. I fear I have
no idea where to find it; in one of the “odds and ends” compilations
most likely. So please, look somebody; you won’t have wasted your
time!)<br />
I mean criticisms such as “Definition is impossible;” “All arguments are
circular;” “All propositions are tautological.” These are true, but one
is obliged to ignore them in all practical discussions.<br />
This has been put in a sort of text, because the first stumbling-block
to study is the one never has any certainty as to what the author means,
or thinks he means, or is trying to persuade one that he means.<br />
Try something simple: “The soul is part of God.” Now then, when he
writes “soul” does he mean Atma, or Buddhi, or the Higher Manas, or
Purusha, or Yechidah, or Neschamah, or Nepheshch, or Nous, or Psyche, or
Phren, or Ba, or Khu, or Ka, or Animus, or Anima, or Seele, or
what?<br />
As everybody, will he nill he, creates “God” in his own image, it is
perfectly useless to inquire what he may happen to mean by that.<br />
But even this very plain word “part.” Does he mean to imply a
quantitative assertion, as when one says sixpence is part of a pound, or
a factor indispensable, as when one says “A wheel is part of a
motor-car”, or . . . (Part actually means “a share, that which is
provided,” according to Skeat; and I am closer to the place where Moses
was when the candle went out than I was before!)<br />
The fact is that very few of us know what words mean; fewer still take
the trouble to enquire. We calmly, we carelessly assume that our minds
are identical with that of the writer, at least on that point; and then
we wonder that there should be misunderstandings!<br />
The fact is (again!) that usually we don’t really want to know; it is so
very much easier to drift down the river of discourse, “lazily, lazily,
drowsily, drowsily, In the noonday sun.”<br />
Why is this so satisfactory? Because although we may not know what a
word means, most words have a pleasant or unpleasant connotation, each
for himself, either because of the ideas or images thus begotten, of
hopes or memories stirred up, or merely for the sound of the word
itself. (I have gone a month’s journey out of my way to visit a town,
just because I liked the sound of the name!)<br />
Then there are devices: style—rhythm, cadence, rime, ornamentation of a
thousand kinds. I think one may take it that the good writer makes use
of such artifice to make his meaning clear; the bad writer to obscure
it, or to conceal the fact that he has none.<br />
One of the best items of the education system at the Abbey in Cefalu was
the weekly Essay.<br />
Everyone, including children of five or six, had to write on “The
Housing Problem,” “Why Athens Decayed,” “The Marriage System,” “Buddhist
Ethics” and the like; the subject didn’t matter much; the point was that
one had to discover, arrange and condense one’s ideas about it, so as to
present it in a given number of words, 93 or 156, or 418 as like as not,
that number, neither more nor less. A superb discipline for any
writer.<br />
I had a marvellous lesson myself some years earlier. I had cut down a
certain ritual of initiation to what I thought were the very barest
bones, chiefly to make it easy to commit to memory.1 Then came a
candidate who was deaf—not merely “a little hard of hearing;” his
tympana were ruptured—and the question was How?<br />
All right for most of it; one could show him the words typed on slips.
But during part of the ceremony he was hoodwinked; one was reduced to
the deaf-and-dumb alphabet devised for such occasions. I am as clumsy
and stupid at that as I am at most things, and lazy, infernally lazy, on
top of that. Well, when it came to the point, the communication of the
words became abominably, intolerably tedious.<br />
And then! Then I found that about two-thirds of my “absolutely
essential” ritual was not necessary at all!<br />

XXVII: Structure of Mind Based on that of Body (Haeckel and Bertrand
Russell)</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Was the sudden cloudburst at the end of my last letter somewhat of a
surprise, and more that somewhat of a shock? Cheer up! The worst is yet
to come.<br />
This is where clean thinking—a subject whose fringes I seem to remember
having touched—wins the Gold Medal of the Royal Humane Society.<br />
It is surely the wise course to accept the plain facts; to try to
explain them away, or to excuse them, is certain to involve one in a
maelstrom of sophistry; and when, despite these laudable efforts, the
facts jump up and land a short jab to the point, one is even worse off
than before.<br />
This has to be said, because Sammasati is assuredly one of the most
useful, as well as one of the most trustworthy and most manageable,
weapons in the armoury of the Aspirant.<br />
You stop me, obviously with a demand for a personal explanation. “How is
it,” you write, “that you reject with such immitigable scorn the very
foundation-stones of Buddhism, and yet refer disciples enthusiastically
to the technique of some of its subtlest super-structures?”<br />
I laff.<br />
It is the old, old story. When the Buddha was making experiments and
recording the results, he was on safe ground: when he started to
theorise, committing (incidentally) innumerable logical crimes in the
process, he is no better a guesser than the Arahat next door, or for the
matter of that, the Arahat’s Lady Char.<br />
So, if you don’t mind, we will look a little into this matter of
Sammasati: what is it when it’s at home?<br />
It may be no more than a personal fancy, but I think Allan Bennett’s
translation of the term, “Recollection,” is as near as one can get in
English. One can strain the meaning slightly to include Recollection, to
imply the ranging of one’s facts, and the fitting of them into an
organised structure. The term “sati” suggests an identification of Being
with Knowledge—see The Soldier and the Hunchback: !<br />
And ? (Equinox I, 1). So far as it applies to the Magical Memory, it
lays stress on some such expedient, very much as is explained in Liber
Thisarb (Magick, pp. 415 - 422).<br />
But is it not a little strange that “The Abomination of Desolation
should be set up in the Holy Place,” as it were? Why should the
whole-hearted search for Truth and Beauty disclose such hateful and such
hideous elements as necessary components of the Absolute
Perfection?<br />
Never mind the why, for a moment; first let us be sure that it is so.
Have we any grounds for expecting this to be the case?<br />
We certainly have.<br />
This is a case where “clean thinking” is most absolutely helpful. The
truth is of exquisite texture; it blazons the escutcheon of the Unity of
Nature in such delicate yet forceful colours that the Postulant may well
come thereby to the Opening of the Trance of Wonder; yet religious
theories and personal pernicketiness have erected against its impact the
very stoutest of their hedgehogs of prejudice.<br />
Who shall help us here? Not the sonorous Vedas, not the Upanishads, Not
Apollonius, Plotinus, Ruysbroeck, Molinos; not any gleaner in the field
of à priori; no, a mere devotee of natural history and biology: Ernst
Haeckel.<br />
Enormous, elephantine, his work’s bulk is almost incredible; for us his
one revolutionary discovery is pertinent to this matter of Sammasati and
the revelations of one’s inmost subtle structure.<br />
He discovered, and he demonstrated, that the history of any animal
throughout the course of its evolution is repeated in the stages of the
individual. To put it crudely, the growth of a child from the fertilised
ovum to the adult repeats the adventures of its species.<br />
This doctrine is tremendously important, and I feel that I do not know
how to emphasise it as it deserves. I want to be exceptionally accurate;
yet the use of his meticulous scientific terms, with an armoury of
quotations, would almost certainly result in your missing the point,
“unable to see the wood for the trees.”<br />
Let me put it that the body is formed by the super-position of layers,
each representing a stage in the history of the evolution of the
species. The foetus displays essential characteristics of insect,
reptile, mammal (or whatever they are) in the order in which these
classes of animal appeared in the world’s history.<br />
Now I want to put forward a thesis—and as far as I know it is personal
to myself, based on my work at Cefalu—to the effect that the mind is
constructed on precisely the same lines.<br />
You will remember from my note on “Breaks” in meditation how one’s
gradual improvement in the practice results in the barring-out of
certain classes of idea, by classes. The ready-to-hand, recent fugitive
thoughts come first and first they go. Then the events of the previous
day or so, and the preoccupations of the mind for that period. Next, one
comes to the layer of reveries and other forms of wish-phanstasm; then
cryptomnesia gets busy with incidents of childhood and the like;
finally, there intrudes the class of “atmospherics,” where one cannot
trace the source of the interruption.<br />
All these are matters of the conscious rational mind; and when I
explored and classified these facts, in the very first months of my
serious practice of Yoga, I had no suspicion that they were no more than
the foam on a glass of champagne: nay,</p>
<p>Rather of “black wine in jars of jade<br />
Cooled all these months in hoarded snow,<br />
Black wine with purple starlight in its bosom,<br />
Oily and sweet as the soul of a brown maid<br />
Brought from the forenoon’s archipelago,<br />
Her brows bound bright with many a scarlet blossom<br />
Like the blood of the slain that flowered free<br />
When we met the black men knee to knee.”</p>
<p>How apt the verses are! How close are wine and snow to lust and
slaughter! I have been digressing, for all that; let us return to our
goats!<br />
The structure of the mind reveals its history as does the structure of
the body.<br />
(Capitals, please, or bang on something; that has got to sink in.)<br />
Just as your body was at one stage the body of an ape, a fish, a frog
(and all the rest of it) so did that animal at that stage possess a mind
correlative.<br />
Now then! In the course of that kind of initiation conferred by
Sammasati, the layers are stripped off very much as happens in
elementary meditation (Dharana) to the conscious mind.<br />
(There is a way of acquiring a great deal of strange and unsuspected
knowledge of these matters by the use of Sulphuric Ether, (C2H5)2O,
according to a special technique. I wrote a paper on it once, 16
pp. 4{to}, and fearing that it might be lost had many copies made and
distributed. Where is it? I must write you a letter one day.1)<br />
Accordingly, one finds oneself experiencing the thoughts, the feelings,
the desires of a gorilla, a crocodile, a rat, a devil-fish, or what have
you! One is no longer capable of human thoughts in the ordinary sense of
the word; such would be wholly unintelligible.<br />
I leave the rest to your imagination; doesn’t it sound to you a little
like some of the accounts of “The Dweller on the Threshold?”</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xxviii-need-to-define-god-self-etc.">Chapter XXVIII:
Need to Define “God”, “Self”, etc.</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Artless remark! Oh you!<br />
Well, I suppose it’s a gift—to stir Hell to its most abysmal horror with
one small remark slipped in at the end. Scorpion!<br />
“Higher self”—“God within us.”<br />
Dear Lady, you could never have picked five words from Iroquois, or
Banti, or Basuto or the Jargon of Master François Villon, or Pictish,
which severally and together convey less to my mind.<br />
No, no, not Less: I mean More, so much more that it amounts to nothing
at all. Spencer Montmorency Bourbon Hohenstaufen sounds very exclusive
and aristocratic, and even posh or Ritzy; but if you bestow these names
upon every male child, the effect tends to diminish. The “Southern
Gentleman” Lee Davis recently hanged for rape and murder, was not a near
relation either of the General or the President: he was a Nigger.1<br />
Refers to a pious phrase at the end of her letter. Gimme the old spade,
I’ve got to go digging again.<br />
1. Higher. Here we fall straight into the arms of Freud. Why “higher?”
Because in a scrap it is easier to strangle him if you are on top. When
very young children watch their parents in actu coitus, a circumstance
exceedingly usual almost anywhere outside England, and even here where
houseroom is restricted, the infant supposes that his mother, upon whom
he depends entirely for nourishment, is being attacked by the intrusive
stranger whom they want him to address as “Dad.” From this seed springs
an “over-under complex,” giving rise later on, in certain cases to whole
legions of neuroses.<br />
Now then make it a little clearer, please, just what you mean by
“higher.”<br />
Skeat seems to connect it with hills, swellings, boils, the maternal
breast; is that reason enough for us to connect it with the idea of
advantage, or—“superiority” merely translates it into Latin!—worth, or—
no, it’s really too difficult. Of course, sometimes it has a “bad”
meaning, as of temperature in fever; but nearly always it implies a
condition preferable to “low.”<br />
Applied to the “self,” it becomes a sort of trade name; nobody tells me
if he means Khu, or Ba, or Khabs, or Ut of the Upanishads or Augoeides
of the Neo-Platonists, or Adonai of Bulwer-Lytton, or — — here we are
with all those thrice-accurs’t alternatives. There is not, cannot be,
any specific meaning unless we start with a sound skeleton of ontogenic
theory, a well-mapped hierarchy of the Cosmos, and define the term
anew.<br />
Then why use it? To do so can only cause confusion, unless the context
helps us to clarify the image. And that is surely rather a defeatist
attitude, isn’t it?<br />
When I first set myself to put a name to my “mission”—the contemplation
carried me half-way across South-West China—I considered these
alternatives. I thought to cut the Gordian Knot, and call it by
Abramelin’s title the “Holy Guardian Angel” because (I mused) that will
be as intelligible to the villagers of Pu Peng as to the most learned
Pundits; moreover, the implied theory was so crude that no one need be
bound by it.<br />
All this is rubbish, as you will see when we reach the discussion on
“self:” To explain now would lead to too unwieldy a digression.<br />
2. “Within.” If you don’t mind, we’ll tackle this now, while “higher” is
fresh in our minds; for it is also a preposition. First you want to go
up; then you want to go in. Why? As “higher” gave the idea of
aggression, of conquest, “within” usually implies safety. Always we get
back to that stage of history when the social unit, based on the family,
was little less than condition No. 1 of survival. The house, the castle,
the fortified camp, the city wall; the “gens,” the clan, the tribe, the
“patria,” to be outside means danger from cold, hunger and thirst,
raiding parties, highway robbers, bears, wolves, and tigers. To go out
was to take a risk; and, your labour and courage being assets to your
kinsmen, you were also a bad man; in fact, a “bounder” or “outsider.”
“Debauch” is simply “to go out of doors!” St. John says: “without are
dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and adulterers and idolaters and…”—
so on.2<br />
We of Thelema challenge all this briskly. “The word of Sin is
Restriction.” (AL I, 41). Our formula, roughly speaking, is to go out
and grab what we want. We do this so thoroughly that we grow thereby,
extending our conception of “I” by including each new accretion instead
of remaining a closely delineated self, proud of possessing other
things, as do the Black Brothers.<br />
We are whole-hearted extroverts; the penalty of restricting oneself is
anything from neurosis to downright lunacy; in particular,
melancholia.<br />
You ask whether these remarks do not conflict with my repeated
definition of Initiation as the Way In.<br />
Not at all; the Inmost is identical with the All. As you travel inward,
you become able to perceive all the layers which surround the “Self”
from within, thus enlarging the scope of your vision of the Universe. It
is like moving from a skirmishing patrol to G.H.Q.; and the object of so
doing is obviously to exercise constantly increasing control over the
whole Army. Every step in rank enables you both to see more and to do
more; but one’s attention is inevitably directed outward.<br />
When the entire system of the Universe is conterminous with your
comprehension, “inward” and “outward” become identical.<br />
But it won’t do at all to seek anything within but a point of view, for
the simple reason that there is nothing else there!<br />
It is just like all those symbols in The Book of Thoth; as soon as you
get to the “end” of anything, you suddenly find it is the
“beginning.”<br />
To formulate the idea of “self” at all, you must posit limitations;
anything that is distinguishable is a mere temporary (and arbitrary)
selection of the finite from the infinite; whatever you chose to think
of, it changes, it grows, it disappears.<br />
You have got to train your mind to canter through those leafy avenues of
thought upon the good green turf of Indifference; when you can do it
without conscious effort, so that up-down, in-out, farnear, black-white
(and so on for everything) appears quite automatically, you are already
as near an Initiate as makes no matter.<br />
3. “Self.” For a full discussion of this see Letter XLII<br />
4. “God.” This is really too bad of you! Of all the hopelessly mangled
words in the language, you settle with unerring Sadism on the most
brutally butchered.<br />
Crippen was an amateur.<br />
Skeat hardly helps us at all, except by warning us that “good” has
nothing whatever to do with it.3<br />
Dieu comes from Deus, with all its Sol-Jupiter references, and Deos,
which Plato thought meant a runner; hence, Sun, Moon, Planets.<br />
The best I can do for you, honest Injun! is the Russian word for god
Bog; connected probably, though the Lithuanian, with the Welsh Bwq a
spectre or hobgoblin. Bugge, too. Not very inspiring, is it, to replace
the Old Hundredth by “Hush! Hush! Hush! here come the Bogey Man.” Or is
it?<br />
Enough of this fooling! Out, trusty rapier, and home to the stone heart
of the audacious woman that wrote “God within us.”<br />
I know you thought you knew more or less what you meant when you wrote
it; but surely that was a mere slip. An instant’s thought would have
warned you that the word wouldn’t stand even the most superficial
analysis. You meant “Something which seems to me the most perfect symbol
of all that I love, worship, admire”—all that class of verb.<br />
But nobody else will have the same set of qualities in his private
museum; you have, as everyone has always done, made another God in your
own image.<br />
Then the Vedantists define God as “having neither quality nor quantity;”
and some Yogis have a practice of setting up images to knock them down
at once with “Not that! Not that!”<br />
And the Buddhists won’t admit any God at all in anything at all like the
sense in which you use the word.+<br />
What’s worse, whatever you may mean by “God” conveys no idea to me: I
can only guess by the light of my exceedingly small knowledge of you and
your general habits of thought and action. Then what sense was there in
chucking it at my head? Half a brick would have served you better.<br />
You think you can explain to me viva voce, perhaps? Don’t you dare try!
Whatever you said, I should prove to be nonsense, philosophically and in
a dozen other ways. And the County Council Ambulance would bundle you
off in your battered and bewildered debris to the Bug-house, as is so
etymologically indicated.<br />
Do see it simply; the word must in any event connote ideas of Neschamah,
not of Ruach.<br />
“But you use the word all the time.” Yes, I do, and rely on the context
to crystallise this most fluid—or gaseous—of expressions.<br />
Crippen was a famous English poisoner who was caught and hung.† One of
the most amusing passages of irony is to be found in The Questions of
King Milinda where the Arhat Nagasena demolishes Maha Brahma.<br />
5. “Us.” Why “Us”? Is this a reference to the Old School Tie, or that
Finishing School in Brussels, and the ticket to the Royal enclosure at
Ascot? I do not suppose for a moment that you meant it that way: but
it’s there. And so— Anecdote of Lao-Tze.<br />
The Old One was surrounded as usual by a galaxy of adoring disciples,
and they were trying to get him to show them where the Tao was to be
found.<br />
It was in the Sun and Moon, he admitted; it was in the Son of Heaven and
in the Superior Man. (Not George Nathaniel Curzon, however). It was in
the Blossoms of Springtide, and in the chilling winds that swept over
from Siberia, and in the Wild Geese that it bore Southward when their
instinct bade them. In short, the catalogue began to look is if it were
going to extend indefinitely; and an impatient disciple, pointing to
certain traces left by a mule in its recent passage, asked: “And is the
Tao also in that?” The Master nodded, and echoed: “Also in that.”<br />
Then what becomes of this privileged “us”? We are obliged to extend it
to include everything. Then, as we have just seen, “God” also is
unfettered by definitions.<br />
Net result: “God within us” means precisely nothing at all.<br />
And so it does, By Brahman!<br />
“Bind nothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any one
thing &amp; any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt. But whoso
availeth in this, let him be the chief of all!” (AL I, 22 - 23)<br />
I implore you not to point out that, this being the case, words like
“hurt” and “chief” cannot possibly mean anything. The fact is that if we
are to get on peaceably in the Club, we have to know when to take any
given expression in a Pickwickian sense.<br />
In the Ruach all the laws of logic apply: they don’t in Neschamah.<br />
The real meaning of the passage is simple enough, if you understand that
it refers to a specific result of Initiation. You have to be able to
reckon up the Universe, as a whole and in every part; and to get rid of
all its false or partial realities by discarding everything but the One
Reality which is the sole truth in, and of Illusion.<br />
There is one set of equations which express the relation of the
Perceiver and the Perceived, adjusted in accordance with the particular
limitations on both sides; another cancels out all the finite terms, and
leaves us with an ultimate x = o = 00.<br />
See?<br />
I know I’m a disheartening kind of bloke, and it does seem so unfriendly
to jump down a fellow’s throat every minute or so when she tries to put
it ever so nicely, and it is so easy —isn’t it?—to play the game of
Sanctimonious Grandiloquence, and surely what was said was perfectly
harmless, and . . . .<br />
No, N.O., no: not harmless at all. My whole object is it train you to
silence every kind of hypothetical speculation, and formulae both
resonant and satisfying. I want you to—<br />
abhor them<br />
abominate them<br />
despise them<br />
detest them<br />
escew them<br />
hate them<br />
loathe them<br />
and da capo.<br />
and to get on with your practice. Then when you get the results, you can
try, albeit uselessly, to fit your own words to the facts, if you should
wish to communicate, for any good reason, your experiences to other
people.<br />
Then, despairing of your impotence, how glad you will be that you have
been trained not to let anyone fob you off with phrases.</p>

<p>1: Crowley sometimes carries his despite for euphemism to a point
that obscures his purpose. The use of the term “nigger” here gives such
offense to the modern reader that the point can be missed!<br />
This was not so in Crowley’s youth, when this term was used without
regard for its effect. For the record, “nigger” does not derive from
“negro” = “black” but from “niggard” = “lazy.” Crowley uses it here for
the stereotype; but he also uses it deliberately to shock, as a lazy way
to make such an effect. That makes Crowley a “nigger” at this point, as
the word is properly defined! – WEH<br />

also be a contraction of “Odin”, as “’Od”—have the English speaking
Christians been praying to the Aesir all this time? – WEH.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-xxix-what-is-certainty">Chapter XXIX: What is
Certainty?</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I ought to have expected you to cock that wise left
eyebrow at me! Right you are to wonder precisely what I mean by
“certainty,” in the light of:</p>
<p>“On Soul’s curtain Is written this one certainty, that naught is
certain.”</p>
<p>Then there is that chapter in The Book of Lies (again!)1<br />
The Chinese cannot help thinking that the Octave has five notes.<br />
The more necessary anything appears to my mind, the more certain it is
that I only assert a limitation.<br />
I slept with Faith, and found a corpse in my arms on awaking; I drank
and danced all night with Doubt, and found her a virgin in the
morning.<br />
I wouldn’t start to argue with the Chinese, if I were you; they might
remind you that you exude the stench peculiar to corpses.<br />
Again, that other “Hymn to St. Thomas”, as I ought perhaps to have
called it:2</p>
<p>Doubt.<br />
Doubt Thyself.<br />
Doubt even if thou doubtest thyself.<br />
Doubt all<br />
Doubt even if thou doubtest all.<br />
It seems sometimes as if beneath all conscious doubt there lay some
deepest certainty. O kill it! slay the snake!<br />
The horn of the Doubt-Goat be exalted!<br />
Dive deeper, ever deeper, into the Abyss of Mind, until thou unearth
that fox THAT. On, hounds!<br />
Yoicks! Tally-ho! Bring THAT to bay!<br />
Then, wind the Mort!<br />
Once more—what a book that is: I never realised it until now! it
says—see that double page at the onset, one with “?” and the other with
“!” alone upon the blank. Moreover you should read the long essay The
Soldier and the Hunchback: ! And ? in the first volume and number of The
Equinox.<br />
But every one of those—rather significant, nich wahr?—slides into a
rhapsody of exaltation, a dithyramb, a Paean. No good here. For what you
want is a penny plain pedestrian prose Probability-Percentage. You want
to know what the Odds are when I say “certain.”<br />
A case for casuistry? At least, for classification. It depends rather on
one’s tone of voice? Yes, of course, and as to the classification, off
we jog to the Divine Pymander, who saw, and stated, the quiddity of our
query with his accustomed lucidity. He discerns three degrees of Truth;
and he distinguishes accordingly:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>True<br />
</li>
<li>Certain without error<br />
</li>
<li>Of all truth.3</li>
</ol>
<p>Clear enough, the difference between 1 and 2: ask me the time, I say
half-past two; and that’s true enough. But the Astronomer Royal is by no
manner of means satisfied with any approximation of that kind. He wants
it accurate. He must know the longitude to a second; he must have
decided what method of measuring time is to be used; he must make
corrections for this and for that; and he must have attached an
(arbitrary) interpretation to the system; the whole question of
Relativity pops up.<br />
And, even so, he will enter a caveat about every single ganglion in the
gossamer of his calculations.<br />
It seems natural to me—apodeictic after a fashion—to treat Doubt as
positive, even aggressive.<br />
There is none of the wavering, wobbling, woebegone wail of the weary and
bewildered wage-slave; it is a triumphant challenge, disagreement for
its own sake. Irish! Browning painted a quite perfect picture of my
Doubt.</p>
<p>Up jumped Tokay on our table,<br />
Like a pigmy castle-warder,<br />
Dwarfish to see but stout and able,<br />
Arms and accoutrement all in order;<br />
And fierce he looked North, then wheeling South<br />
Blew with his bugle a challenge to Drouth,<br />
Cocked his flap-hat with the tosspot feather,<br />
Twisted his thumb in his red moustache,<br />
Jingled his huge brass spurs together,<br />
Tightened his waist with its Buda Sash,<br />
And then, with an impudence nought could abash<br />
Shrugged his hump-shoulder, to tell the beholder,<br />
For twenty such knaves he should laugh but the bolder;<br />
And so, with his sword-hilt gallantly jutting,<br />
And dexter hand on his haunch abutting,<br />
Went the little man, Sir Ausbruch, strutting!</p>
<p>It’s not the least bit like Tokay; rather the Bull’s Blood its
neighbour, or any rough strong red wine like Rioja. Curious, though, his
making him a hunchbacked dwarf; there must be something in this deep
down. I wonder what! (Ask Jung!)<br />
Well then, all this intricate differentiation and integration and
verification and Lord knows what leads at last to a statement which may
be called “Certain without Error.”<br />
Excuse me just a moment! When I was staying at the Consulate of
Tengyueh, just inside the S.W. frontier of China, our one link with
England, Home, and Beauty was the Telegraph Service from Peking. One
week it was silent, and we were anxious for news, our last bit of
information having been that there was rioting in Shanghai, seventeen
Sikh policemen killed. For all we knew the whole country might rise en
masse at any moment to expel the “Foreign Devils.” At last the welcome
messenger trotted across from the city in the twilight with a whole
sheaf of telegrams. Alas, save for the date of dispatch, the wording in
each one was identical: each told us that it was noon in Peking!<br />
They had to be relayed at Yung Chang, and both the operators had taken
ten days off to smoke opium, sensible fellows!<br />
But Hermes Trismegistus is not content with any such fugues as the
Astronomer, however cunning and colossal his Organ; his Third Degree
demands much more than this. The Astronomer’s estimate has puttied every
tiniest crack, he concedes it, but then waves it brusquely away: all the
time the door is standing wide open!<br />
The Astronomer’s exquisitely tailored figure stands in abashed
isolation, like a gawky young man at his first Ball; he feels that he
doesn’t belong. For this D.S.T., or Greenwich, or what not, however
exact in itself, is so only in reference to some other set of
measurements which themselves turn out to be arbitrary; it is not of any
ultimate import; nobody can dispute it, but it simply doesn’t matter to
anybody, apart from the particular case. It is not “Of all Truth.”<br />
What Hermes means by this it will be well to enquire.<br />
May we call it “a truth of Religion?” (Don’t be shocked! The original
word implies a binding-togetheragain, as in a “Body of Doctrine:”
compare the word “Ligature.” It was only later by corruption, that the
word came to imply “piety;” re-ligens, attentive (to the gods) as
opposed to neg-ligens, neglectful.)<br />
I think that Hermes was contemplating a Ruach closely knitted together
and anchored by incessant Aspiration to the Supernal Triad; just such an
one, in short, as appears in those remarks on the Magical Memory, a
God-man ready to discard his well-worn Instrument for a new one, bought
up to date with all the latest improvements (the movement of the
Zeitgeist during his past incarnation, in particular) well-wrought and
ready for his use.<br />
This being so, a truth which is “of all Truth” should mean any
proposition which forms an essential part of this Khu—this “Magical
Identity” of a man.<br />
How curious it must appear at the first glance to note that the truths
of this order should prove to be what we call Axioms—or even
Platitudes—<br />
. . . . . . What’s that noise?<br />
. . . . . . I think I hear Sir Ausbruch!<br />
And in full eruption too! And hasn’t he the right? For all this time
we’ve bluffed our way breezily ahead over the sparkling seas, oblivious
of that very Chinese Chinese-puzzle that we started with, the paradox
(is it?) of the Chinese Gamut.<br />
(We shan’t get into doldrums; there’s always the way out from “?” to “!”
as with any and every intellectual problem whatsoever: it’s the only
way. Otherwise, of course, we get to A is A, A is not-A, not-A is not-A,
not-A is A, as is inevitable).<br />
“The more certain I am of anything, the more certain it is that I am
only asserting a limitation of my own mind.”<br />
Very good, but what am I to do about it? Some at least of such
certainties must surely be “of all Truth.” The test of admission to this
class ought to be that, of one were to accept the contradictory of the
proposition, the entire structure of the Mind would be knocked to
pieces, as is not at all the case with the Astronomer’s determination,
which may turn out to be wrong for a dozen different reasons without
anybody getting seriously wounded in his tenderest feelings.<br />
The Statesman knows instinctively, or at worst, by his training and
experience, what sort of assertion, harmless enough on the surface, may
be “dangerous thinking,” a death-blow to his own idea of what is “of all
Truth,” and strikes out wildly in a panic entirely justifiable from his
own point of view. Exhibit No. 1: Galileo and that lot. What could it
possibly matter to the Gospel story that people should think that the
Earth moves round the Sun? (Riemann, and oh! such a lot of things, have
shewn that it didn’t and doesn’t! This sort of “Truth” is only a set of
conventions.)<br />
“Oh, don’t gas away like this! I want to know what to do about it. Am I
to accept this caterwauling Gamut, and enlarge my Mind, and call it an
Initiation? Or am I to nail my own of-all-Truth Tonic Solfa to the Mast,
and go down into the Maelstrom of Insanity with colours flying? Do you
really need Massed Bands to lull Baby to sleep?<br />
The Master of the Temple deals very simply and efficiently with problems
of this kind.”The Mind” (says he) of this Party of the First Part,
hereinafter referred to as Frater N (or whatever his 8° = 3° motto may
be) is so constructed that the interval from C to C is most harmoniously
divided into n notes; that of the Party of the Second Part hereinafter
referred to as—not a Heretic, an Atheist, a Bolshie, ad Die-hard, a
Schismatic, an Anarchist, a Black Magician, a Friend of Aleister
Crowley, or whatever may be the current term of abuse—Mr A, Lord B, the
Duke of C, Mrs X, or whatever he or she may chance to be called—into
five. The Structure called of-all-Truth in neither of us is affected in
the least, any more than in the reading of a Thermometer with Fahrenheit
on one side and Centigrade on the other.<br />
You naturally object that this answer is little better than an evasion,
that it automatically pushes the Gamut question outside the Charmed
of-all-Truth Circle.<br />
No, it doesn’t really; for if you were able to put up a Projection of
those two minds, there would be, firstly, some sort of compensation
elsewhere than in the musical section; and secondly, some Truth of a yet
higher order which is common to both.<br />
Not unaware am I that these conceptions are at first exceedingly
difficult to formulate clearly. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that one
would have to be a Master of the Temple to understand them; but it is
really very necessary to have grasped firmly the doctrine that “a thing
is only true insofar as it contains its contradiction in itself.” (A
good way to realise this is by keeping up a merry dance of paradoxes,
such as infest Logic and Mathematics. The repeated butting of the head
against a brick wall is bound in the long run to shake up the little
grey cells (as Poirot4 might say), teach you to distrust any train of
argument, however apparently impeccable the syllogisms, and to seek ever
more eagerly the dawn of that Neschamic consciousness where all these
things are clearly understood, although impossible to express in
rational language.)<br />
The prime function of intellect is differentiation; it deals with marks,
with limits, with the relations of what is not identical; in Neschamah
all this work has been carried out so perfectly that the “rough working”
has passed clean out of mind; just so, you say “I” as if it were an
indivisible Unity, unconscious of the inconceivably intricate machinery
of anatomical, physiological, psychological construction which issues in
this idea of “I.”<br />
We may then with some confidence reaffirm that our certainties do assert
our limitations; but this kind of limitation is not necessarily harmful,
provided that we view the situation in its proper perspective, that we
understand that membership of the of-all-Truth class does not (as one is
apt to think at first sight) deepen the gulfs which separate mind from
mind, but on the contrary put us in a position to ignore them. Our acts
of “love under will,” which express our devotion to Nuit, which multiply
the fulfilments of our possibilities, become continually more
efficacious, and more closely bound up with our Formula of Initiation;
and we progressively become aware of deeper and vaster Images of the
ofall-Truth class, which reconcile, by including within themselves, all
apparent antinomies.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-xxx-do-you-believe-in-god">Chapter XXX: Do you believe
in God?</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You are quite right, as usual. True, we have gone over a great deal
of the ground in various learned disquisitions of Gods, Angels, Elves,
et hoc genus omne.<br />
But God with a capital “G” in the singular is a totally different pair
of Blüchers—nicht wahr?<br />
Let me go back just for a moment to the meaning of “belief.” We agreed
that the word was senseless except as it implies an opinion, instinct,
conviction—what you please!—so firmly entrenched in our natures that we
act automatically as if it were “true” and “certain without error,”
perhaps even “of the essence of truth.”1 (Browning discusses this in Mr
Sludge the Medium.) Good: the field is clear for an enquiry into this
word God.<br />
We find ourselves in trouble from the start.<br />
We must define; and to define is to limit; and to limit is to reduce
“God” to “a God” or at best “the God.”<br />
He must be omniscient (Mercury) omnipotent, (Sulphur) and omnipresent
(Salt);2 yet to such a Being no purpose would be possible; so that all
the apologies for the existence of “evil” crash. If there be opposites
of any kind, there can be no consistency. He cannot be Two; He must be
One; yet, as is obvious, he isn’t.<br />
How do the Hindu philosophers try to get out of this quag? “Evil” is
“illusion;” has no “real” existence.<br />
Then what is the point of it?<br />
They say “Not that, not that!” denying to him all attributes; He is
“that which is without quantity or quality.” They contradict themselves
at every turn; seeking to remove limit, they remove definition.<br />
Their only refuge is in “super-consciousness.” Splendid! but now
“belief” has disappeared altogether; for the word has no sense unless it
is subject to the laws of normal thought… Tut! you must be feeling it
yourself; the further one goes, the darker the path. All I have written
is somehow muddled and obscure, maugre my frenzied struggle for
lucidity, simplicity . . . .<br />
Is this the fault of my own sophistication? I asked myself. Tell you
what! I’ll trot round to my masseuse, and put it up to her. She is a
simple country soul, by no means overeducated, but intelligent; capable
of a firm grasp of the principles of her job; a steady church-goer on
what she considers worthwhile occasions; dislikes the rector, but
praises his policy of keeping his discourse within bounds. She has done
quite a lot of thinking for herself; distrusts and despises the Press
and the Radio, has no use for ready-made opinions. She shares with the
flock their normal prejudices and phobias, but is not bigoted about
them, and follows readily enough a line of simply-expressed destructive
criticism when it is put to her. This is, however, only a temporary
reaction; a day later she would repeat the previous inanities as if they
had never been demolished. In the late fifties, at a guess. I sprang
your question on her out of the blue, à la “doodle-bug;” premising
merely that I had been asked the question, and was puzzled as to how to
answer it. Her reply was curious and surprising: without a moment’s
hesitation and with great enthusiasm, “Quickly, yes!” The spontaneous
reservation struck me as extremely interesting. I said: of course, but
suppose you think it over—and out—a bit, what am I to understand? She
began glibly “He’s a great big—” and broke off, looking foolish. Then,
although omnipotent, He needed our help—we were all just as powerful as
He, for we were little bits of each other—but exactly how, or to what
end, she did not make clear. An exclamation: “Then there is the
Devil!”<br />
She went on without a word from me for a long while, tying herself up
into fresh knots with every phase. She became irreverent, then downright
blasphemous; stopped short and began to laugh at herself. And so
forth—but, what struck me as curious and significant, in the main her
argument followed quite closely the lines which came naturally to me, at
the beginning of this letter!<br />
In the end, “curiouser and curiouser,” she arrived at a practically
identical conclusion: she believed, but what she believed in was
Nothing!<br />
As to our old criterion of what we imply in practice when we say that we
believe, she began by saying that If we “helped” God in His mysterious
plan, He would in some fashion or other look after us. But about this
she was even more vague than in the matter of intellectual conviction;
“helping God” meant behaving decently according to one’s own instinctive
ideas of what “decently” means.<br />
It is very encouraging that she should have seen, without any prompting
on my part, to what a muddle the question necessarily led; and very nice
for me, because it lets me out, cara soror!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. I thought it a good plan to put my fundamental position all by
itself in a postscript; to frame it.<br />
My observation of the Universe convinces me that there are beings of
intelligence and power of a far higher quality than anything we can
conceive of as human; that they are not necessarily based on the
cerebral and nervous structures that we know; and that the one and only
chance for mankind to advance as a whole is for individuals to make
contact with such Beings.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xxxi-religionis-thelema-a-new-religion">Chapter XXXI:
Religion–Is Thelema a “New Religion”?</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>“Would you describe your system as a new religion?” A pertinent
question, you doubtless suppose; whether it may happen to mean anything
is—is—is—well, is what we must try to make clear.<br />
True, it’s a slogan of A.’. A.’. “The method of science—the aim of
religion.&amp; Here the word”aim” and the context help the definition;
it must mean the attainment of Knowledge and Power in spiritual
matters—or words to that effect: as soon as one selects a phrase, one
starts to kick holes in it! Yet we both know perfectly well all the time
what we do mean.<br />
But this is certainly not the sense of the word in your question. It may
clear our minds, as has so often happened, if we examine it through the
lens of dear old Skeat.<br />
Religion, he says, Latin: religio, piety. Collection or paying attention
to: religens as opposed to negligens, neglecting; the attitude of
Gallio. But it also implies a binding together i.e. of ideas; in fact, a
“body of doctrine.” Not a bad expression. A religion then, is a more or
less coherent and consistent set of beliefs, with precepts and
prohibitions therefrom deducible. But then there is the sense in which
Frazer (and I) often use the word: as in opposition to “Science” or
“Magic.” Here the point is that religious people attribute phenomena to
the will of some postulated Being or Beings, placable and moveable by
virtue of sacrifice, devotion, or appeal. Against such, the scientific
or magical mind believes in the Laws of Nature, asserts “If A, then
B”—if you do so-and-so, the result will be so-andso, aloof from
arbitrary interference. Joshua, it is alleged, made the sun stand still
by supplication, and Hezekiah in the same way cause it to “go back upon
the dial of Ahaz;” Willett did it by putting the clock back, and getting
an Act of Parliament to confirm his lunacy. Petruchio, too “It shall be
what o’clock I say it is!” The two last came close to the magical
method; at least, to that branch of it which consists of “fooling all
the people all the time.” But such an operation, if true Magick were
employed, would be beyond the power of any magician of my acquaintance;
for it would mess up the solar system completely. (You remember how this
happened, and what came of it, in a rather clever short story by H.G.
Wells.) For true Magick means “to employ one set of natural forces at a
mechanical advantage as against another set”—I quote, as closely as
memory serves, Thomas Henry Huxley, when he explains that when he lifts
his water-jug—or his elbow—he does not “defy the Law of Gravitation.” On
the contrary, he uses that Law; its equations form part of the system by
which he lifts the jug without spilling the water.<br />
To sum up, our system is a religion just so far as a religion means an
enthusiastic putting-together of a series of doctrines, no one of which
must in any way clash with Science or Magick.<br />
Call it a new religion, then, if it so please your Gracious Majesty; but
I confess that I fail to see what you will have gained by so doing, and
I feel bound to add that you might easily cause a great deal of
misunderstanding, and work a rather stupid kind of mischief.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xxxii-how-can-a-yogi-ever-be-worried">Chapter XXXII: How
can a Yogi ever be Worried?</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>That question I have been expecting for a very long time! And what
you expect is to see my middle stump break the wicket-keeper’s nose,
with the balls smartly fielded by Third Man and Short Leg!<br />
I admit that it looks like a strong case. Here (you put it in your more
elegant prose) we have a Yogi, nay more, a Paramahamsa, a Bodhisattva of
the best: yea, further, we have a Master of the Temple—and is not his
Motto “Vi veri vniversom vivus vici?” and yet we find him fussing like
an old hen over the most trivial of troubles; we find him wrapped in the
lacustrine vapours of Avernus, fretting himself into a fever about
imaginary misfortunes at which no normal person would do more than cast
a contemptuous glance, and get on with the job.<br />
Yes, although you can scarcely evade indictment for unnecessarily
employing the language of hyperbole, I see what you mean. Yet the answer
is adequate; the very terms of his Bargain with Destiny not only allow
for, but imply, some such reaction on the part of the Master to the
Bludgeonings of Fate. (W. E. Henley )<br />
There are two ways of looking at the problem. One is what I may call the
mathematical. If I have ten and sixpence in the world and but a
half-guinea cigar, I have no money left to buy a box of matches.<br />
To “snap out of it” and recover my normal serenity requires only a
minute effort, and the whole of my magical energy is earmarked for the
Great Work. I have none left to make that effort. Of course, if the
worry is enough to interfere with that Work, I must detail a corporal’s
file to abate the nuisance.<br />
The other way may be called the Taoist aspect. First, however, let me
explain the point of view of the Master of the Temple, as it is so
similar. You should remember from your reading what happens in this
Grade. The new Master is “cast out” into the sphere appropriate to the
nature of his own particular Great Work. And it is proper for him to act
in true accordance with the nature of the man as he was when he passed
through that Sphere (or Grade) on his upward journey. Thus, if he be
cast out into 3° = 8°, it is no part of his work to aim at the virtues
of a 4° = 7°; all that has been done long before. It is no business of
his to be bothering his head about anything at all but his Work; so he
must react to events as they occur in the way natural to him without
trying to “improve himself.”<br />
(This, of course, applies not only to worry, but to all his funny little
ways.)<br />
The Taoist position differs little, but it is independent of all
considerations of the man’s attainment; it is an universal rule based on
a particular theory of things in general. Thus, “benevolence and
righteousness” are not “virtues;” they are only symptoms of the
world-disease, in that they should be needed. The same applies to all
conditions, and to all modes of seeking to modify them. There is only
one proper reaction to event; that is, to adjust oneself with perfect
elasticity to whatever happens.<br />
That tiger across the paddy-field looks hungry. There are several ways
of dealing with the situation.<br />
One can run away, or climb a tree, or shoot him, or (in your case) cow
him by the Power of the Human Eye; but the way of the Tao is to take no
particular notice. (This, incidentally, is not such bad Magick; the
diversion of your attention might very well result in your becoming
invisible, as I have explained in a previous letter.) The theory appears
to be that, although your effort to save yourself is successful, it is
bound to create a disturbance of equilibrium elsewhere, with results
equally disastrous. Even more so; it might be that to be eaten by a
tiger is just what you needed in your career through the incarnations;
at that moment there might well be a vacancy somewhere exactly where it
will do most good to your Great Work. When you press on one spot, you
make a corresponding bulge in another, as we often see a beautiful lady,
unhappy about her waistline, adopt drastic measures, and transform
herself into the semblance of a Pouter Puffin!<br />
In theory, I am particularly pleased about this Method, because it goes
for everybody, requires no knowledge, no technical training, “no
nuffin.” All the same, it won’t do for me, except in a much modified
form, and in very special cases; because no course of action (or
inaction) is conceivable that would do great violence to my
nature.<br />
So let me worry along, please, with the accent on the “along;” I will
grin and bear it, or, if it gets so bad that I can’t do my Work, I will
make the necessary effort to abate the nuisance, always most careful to
do as little damage as possible to the main current of my total
Energy.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xxxiii-the-golden-mean">Chapter XXXIII: The Golden
Mean</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You would think that one who like myself has the Sun, the Lord of His
Horoscope, in Libra, with Venus who rules that sign in close conjunction
with him, with Saturn trine, Uranus sextile, Mars square and Luna
quincunx to him, would wear the Golden Mean as a breastplate, flaunt it
on my banneret, quarter it on my escutcheon, and grave it on the
two-edged blade of my thrice trusty falchion!<br />
Just so, objects that instinct itself! “Had you been born a few hours
earlier, with Aries rising, its lord Mars aggravated by the square of
Sol and Venus, you would indeed have been a Wild Man of the Woods,
arrogant, bigoted, domineering, incapable of seeing a second side to any
question, headstrong, haughty, a seething hell-broth of hate; and this
fact disables your judgment.”<br />
All perfectly true. My equable nature is congenitally hostile to extreme
measures, except in imagination. I cannot bear sudden violent movements.
Climbing rocks, people used to say that I didn’t climb them, that I
oozed over them!<br />
This explains, I think, my deep-seated dislike of many passages in The
Book of the Law. “O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing. I
see thee hate the hand &amp; the pen; but I am stronger.” (AL II,
10-11)<br />
Well, what is the upshot of all this? It answers your question about the
value to be attached to this Golden Mean. There is no rule about it;
your own attitude is proper for yourself, and has no value for anybody
else. But you must make sure exactly what that attitude actually is,
deep down.<br />
Let us go back for a moment to the passage above quoted. The text goes
on to give the reason for the facts. “Because of me in Thee which thou
knewest not. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me.” (AL II,
12-13) The unexpected use or disuse of capitals, the queer syntax, the
unintelligibility of the whole passage: these certainly indicate some
profound Qabalistic import in these texts.<br />
So we had better mark that Strictly Private, and forget it.<br />
One point, however, we have forgotten: although my Libra inclinations do
bias me personally, they also make me fair-minded, “a judge, and a good
judge too” in the memorable phrase of the late William Schwenk Gilbert.
So I will sum up what is to be said for and against this Golden
Mean.<br />
As usual, nobody has taken the trouble to define the term. We know that
it was extolled by both the Greek and the Chinese philosophers; but I
cannot see that they meant much more than to counsel the avoidance of
extremes, whether of measures or of opinions; and to advocate moderation
in all things.<br />
James Hilton has a most amusing Chinese in his Lost Horizon. When the
American 100% he-man, mixer, joiner, and go-getter, agrees with him
about broadmindedness in religious beliefs, and ends “and I’m dead sure
you’re right!” his host mildly rebukes him, saying: “But we are only
moderately sure.” Such thought plumbs the Abysses of Wisdom; at least,
it may quite possibly do so. Forgive me if I emulate the teacher!<br />
But this is not as simple as it sounds. There is great danger in this
Golden Mean, one of whose main objects is to steer clear of shipwreck,
Scylla being as fatal as Charybdis. No, this lofty and equable attitude
is worse than wrong unless it derives from striking the balance between
two very distant opposites. One of the worst perils of the present time
is that, in the reaction against ignorant bigotry, people no longer dare
to make up their minds about anything. The very practice which the A.’.
A.’. so strongly and persistently advocates tends to make people feel
that any positive attitude or gesture is certainly wrong, whatever may
be right. They forget that the opposite may, within the limit of the
universe of discourse, amount to nothing.<br />
They fall into flabbiness.<br />
I avoid this—see the example at the very outset of this letter—by
saying: “Yes, I hate so-and-so like hell; I want to exterminate the very
memory of the bastard from the earth, after I have personally
superintended having him ‘Seven years a-killing’ winding up by hanging,
disembowelling, and quartering him. But of course I’m not necessarily
right about this in any sense; it is merely that I happened to be born
the kind of man that feels like that!”<br />
Of course, in no case does the Golden Mean advise hesitating, trimming,
hedging, compromising; the very object of ensuring an exact balance in
your weapon is that its blow may be clean and certain.<br />
You know how all our faults love to disguise themselves as virtues; very
often, as what our neighbours call virtues, not what we ourselves think
them. We are all ashamed to be ourselves; and this is sheer, stark
stultification. For we are ourselves; we cannot get away from it; all
our hypocrisies and shams are just as much part of ourselves as what we
like to think is the real man. All that we do when we make these
pretences is to set up internal strain and conflict; there is nothing
objective in it.<br />
Instead of adding to our experience, which is the Great Work, we shut
ourselves up in this citadel of civil turmoil; it is the Formula of the
Black Brothers.<br />
The Golden Mean is more valuable as the extremes which it summarizes are
distant from each other; that is the plain mechanics of the lever. So
don’t pay too much attention to these remarks; they are no more than the
quiet fireside reflections of a man who has spent all his life breaking
records. The Golden Mean at its best can only keep you from extravagant
blunders; it will never get you anywhere.<br />
The Book of the Law constantly implies a very different policy; listen
to its climax-exhortation:<br />
“But exceed! exceed!” (AL II, 71)<br />
Remember that which is written: “Moderate strength rings the bell: great
strength returns the penny.”<br />
It is always the little bit extra that brings home the bacon. It is the
last attack that breaks through the enemy position. Water will never
boil, however long you keep it at 99° C. You may find that a Pranayama
cycle of 10-20-30 brings no result in months; put it up to 10-20-40, and
Dhyana comes instantly. When in doubt, push just a little bit harder.
You have no means of finding out what are exactly the right conditions
for success in any practice; but all practices are alike in one respect;
the desired result is in the nature of orgasm.<br />
I guess that’s about what I think.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xxxiv-the-tao-1">Chapter XXXIV: The Tao (1)</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>This is the hardest question you have yet put to me: to explain the
Tao. The only proper answer would be Silence, trusting to the slow
dispersion and absorption of the disturbance created by your asking it.
In that sentence there lies, really, the whole explanation; but I see
well enough that it won’t do for you. You are not yet old or wise enough
to understand that the only way to clear muddy water is to leave it
alone. Still, you doubtless expect me to tell you just how that comes to
pass; I will not disappoint you. First of all, what is the Tao? No
proposed equivalent in any other language comes within a billion
light-years of giving even an approximation. For one thing, it is itself
a paradox; for another, it has several meanings which are apparently
quite distinct. For instance, one sinologist calls it “Reason”; another,
“The Way”; another “Tat” or “Shiva.” These are all true in one sense or
another. My own “White Hope” (see The Book of Thoth) is to identify it
with the Qabalistic Zero. This last attribution is useful, as I will
show presently, for hard practical reasons; it is an assumption which
indicates the method of the Old Wise One who approaches the Tao.<br />
As you know, the supreme classic of this subject, is the Tao Teh King;
and I must suppose that you have read this in at least one of the
several translations, else I should have to start by pushing my own
version at you. (This has been ready for a quarter of a century, and I
seem to be unable to get it printed!) None of these published
translations, learned and admirable though they may be as such, can be
of use except to familiarise you with the terminology; for not one of
these scholars has the most nebulous idea of that Laotze was talking
about. I can hardly hope to emphasize sternly enough how deep and wide
is the “Great Gulf fixed” between the initiate and the profane, when
questions of this kind are on the Magic Carpet. Suppose you were
transported (on that Carpet!) to a planet where the highest means of
reproduction was germination; try to make the denizens understand
Catullus, Shelley, Rossetti, or Emily Bronte!<br />
It is, honestly, quite as bad as that. How can anyone grasp the idea of
perfect and absolute negation being at the same time the sole motive
force of all that exits?</p>
<p>“Tao hath no will to work;<br />
But by its influence even<br />
The Moon and Sun rejoice to run<br />
Among the starry Seven.”<br />
King Kang Khang.1</p>
<p>The Book of the Law states the doctrine of Tao very succinctly:
“…thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say
nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of
result, is every way perfect.” (AL I, 42-44)<br />
“Thus also the Sage, seeking not any goal, attaineth all things; he does
not interfere in the affairs of his body, and so that body acteth
without friction. It is because he meddleth not with his personal aims
that these come to pass with simplicity.” Tao Teh King, VII, 2.<br />
The ideal analogy seems to be that of a planet in its orbit. It has its
“true motion;” it meets the minimum of friction from circumambient
space. When it suffers the attraction of another body, it sways slightly
to make the proper adjustment without effort or argument; it can,
consequently, continue indefinitely in its orbit.<br />
This is roughly the plan of the Taoist in his attitude to life. Having
ascertained the Path which satisfies the equations of his Nature (as we
say, “found his True Will”) he continues “without lust of result,”
acting only when it happens to be necessary to adjust himself to any
external stress that affects him, and so proceeds happily</p>
<p>“thinking of a way<br />
To feed oneself on batter,<br />
And so go on from day to day<br />
Getting a little fatter.”</p>
<p>—assuming that his “True Will” is of that variety. Basil King Lamus
asserts this in The Diary of A Drug Fiend when he says: “If I were a
dog, I should bark; if I were an owl, I should hoot.” It is rather like
the pattern in the game of dominoes; you put the card that matches. No
other consideration comes into it at all.<br />
It is the extreme simplicity of this idea which baffles people’s minds,
and the universal quality of impatience which makes everybody fidget,
and so injure the delicacy of the “fine adjustment” which is the essence
of the work.<br />
When I used to climb rocks, I never jumped, I never grabbed, I never
made a sudden or a violent movement; therefore, with thin smooth arms
like a young girl’s, and legs, tough enough it is true but always slow
and steady, I used to find myself at the top of pitches that had beaten
all the gymnasts.<br />
In every sport worth the name one may observe similar facts. Consider
the delicacy required for big breaks at billiards; the problem is always
to secure favourable readjustment with a minimum of disturbance. Of
course, there are positions which demand drastic treatment; but that is
the best evidence that the balls have got into the worst possible mess
from your point of view. But it was an exquisitely delicate “safety
shot” that got them like that. True, there are games in which brute
force is the way to victory; but such games never make progress in
themselves. The “tug-of-war” or “tossing the caber” are exactly as they
were fifty—or five hundred—years ago. Contrast the advance in
“positional” chess!<br />
Oh yes, this is all old stuff! Of course it is; but it remains a useful
sort of basis for meditation when you are seeking to understand one
aspect of the Way of he Tao.<br />
Anyhow (you protest) this is getting away from the question as to what
Tao actually is. Good; but I want you to abstain from trying to make an
intellectual image of it, still less to visualise it. I tried at one
time to do something of the sort with the Fourth Dimension:2 Hinton
gives a practice involving complex patterns of cubes; and I was never
able to make anything of it.<br />
As I said above, it is a matter of Neschamah; but what follows may help
you.<br />
Why is the Tao translated “Reason”? Because by “Reason” is here meant
the structure of the mind itself; a Buddhist who had succeeded with
Mahasatipatthana might call it the Consciousness of the Tendency to
Perceive the Sensation of Anything. For in the last resort, and through
the pursuit of one line of analysis, this structure is all that we can
call our consciousness. Everything of which we can in any way be aware
may be interpreted as being some function of this structure.<br />
Note! Function. For now we see why Tao may also be translated “The Way”;
for it is the motion of the structure that we observe. There is no Being
apart from Going.<br />
You are familiar with the Four Powers of the Sphinx, attributed by the
Adepts of old time to their Four Elements.</p>
<p>Air is to Know, Scire; Fire is to Will, Velle; Water is to Dare,
Audere; and Earth is to Keep Silence, Tacere. But now that a fifth
Element, spirit, is generally recognised in the Qabalah, I have deemed
it proper to add a Fifth Power corresponding: to Go, Ire. (Book of
Thoth, p. 275) 3</p>
<p>Then, as Spirit is the Origin, the Essence, and the Sum of the other
four, so is to Go in relation to those powers. And to Go is the very
meaning of the name God, as elsewhere shewn in these letters; hence the
Egyptian Gods were signalised as such by their bearing the Ankh, which
is a Sandal-strap, and in its form the Crux Ansata, the Rosy Cross, the
means whereby we demonstrate the Godhead of our Nature. See then how
sweetly each idea slides into the next! How right this is, that the
Quintessence should be dynamic and not static! For if there were some
form of Being separate from Going, it would necessarily be subject to
decay; and, in any case, a thing impossible to apprehend, since
apprehension is itself an Act, not an idea immobile which would be bound
to change in the very moment of grasping it.<br />
As I have tried to shew in another letter, the “Point-Event” (or
whatever it is) of which we are aware is a change, or, less
inaccurately, the memory of one; the things that change remain
relentlessly unknown.<br />
It does seem to me, young woman, that you ought to go over these ideas
again and again, familiarising yourself intimately with this process of
passing from one to another, so intimately that it becomes automatic and
spontaneous for you to run round the circle in perfectly frictionless
ease; for otherwise your mind will be for ever pestering you all your
life, and even your conscience reproaching you; they will say “But you
have never got a definite answer to any single one of your original
questions.” We are all—most of us, anyhow—born with this hankering after
the definite; it is our weakness that yearns for repose. We do not see
that this is death; if any of these answers could be cut off short and
neatly trimmed with paper frills like a ham, it would no longer be even
an approximation to truth.<br />
I am quite sure that this is the Doctrine of the Tao, and of opinion
that no other body of teaching puts forward its thought more clearly or
more simply.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<p>1: The Khing Kang King, or “Classic of Purity” is a short Taoist
writing attributed to one Ko Yüan (or Hsüan); an English translation by
James Legge appeared as an appendix to the two volumes of Taoist texts
in the “Sacred Books of the East” series. While he was in America
between 1914 and 1919 Crowley wrote a poetic paraphrase which he
designated Liber XXI. The verse quoted was originally translated by
Legge as “The Great Tâo has no passions, but It causes the sun and moon
to revolve as they do.” I do not currently have access to any modern

<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You are only one of a number of people who are interested in my
translation of the Tao Teh King.<br />
Naturally, I want to publish it; but so many other things come first. So
I am sending you the Introduction, in the hope that it will stimulate
that interest to the point of getting some other publisher to give it
sea-room.1</p>
<p>I bound myself to devote my life to Magick at Easter 1898 (era
vulgari) and received my first initiation on November 18 of that
year.<br />
My friend and climbing companion, Oscar Eckenstein, gave me my first
instructions in learning the control of the mind early in 1901, in
Mexico City. Shri Parananda, Solicitor General of Ceylon, an eminent
writer upon, and teacher of, Yoga from the orthodox Shaivite standpoint,
and Bhikkhu Ananda Mettaya, (Allan Bennett) the great English Adept, who
was one of my earliest instructors in Magick, and joined the Sangha in
Burma in 1902, gave me my first groundings in mystical theory and
practice. I spent some months of 1901 in Kandy, Ceylon with the latter,
until success crowned my work.<br />
I also studied all varieties of Asiatic philosophy, especially with
regard to the practical question of spiritual development, the Sufi
doctrines, the Upanishads, the Sankhra, Veda and Vedanta, the
Bhagavad-Gita and Purana, the Dammapada, and many other classics,
together with numerous writings on the Tantra and Yoga of such men as
Patanjali, Vivekananda, etc., etc. Not a few of these teachings are as
yet wholly unknown to scholars. I made the scope of my studies as
comprehensive as possible, omitting no school of thought however
unimportant or repugnant.<br />
I made a critical examination of all these teachers in the light of my
practical experience. The physiological and psychological uniformity of
mankind guaranteed that the diversity of expression concealed a unity of
significance. This discovery was confirmed, furthermore, by reference to
Jewish, Greek, and Celtic traditions. One quintessential truth was
common to all cults, from the Hebrides to the Yellow Sea; and even the
main branches proved essentially identical. It was only the foliage that
exhibited incompatibility.<br />
When I walked across China in 1905-6, I was fully armed and accoutred by
the above qualifications to attack the till-then-insoluble problem of
the Chinese conception of religious truth. Practical studies of the
psychology of such Mongolians as I had met in my travels, had already
suggested to me that their acentric conception of the universe might
represent the correspondence in consciousness of their actual
psychological characteristics. I was therefore prepared to examine the
doctrines of their religious and philosophic Masters without prejudice
such as had always rendered nugatory the efforts of missionary
sinologists; indeed, all oriental scholars with the single exception of
Rhys Davids. Until his time, translators had invariable assumed, with
absurd naiveté, or (more often) arrogant bigotry, that a Chinese writer
must be putting forth either a more or less distorted and degraded
variation of some Christian conception, or utterly puerile absurdities.
Even so great a man as Max Müller, in his introduction to the
Upanishads, seems only half inclined to admit that the apparent
triviality and folly of many passages in these so-called sacred writings
might owe their appearance to our ignorance of the historical and
religious circumstances, a knowledge of which would render them
intelligible.<br />
During my solitary wanderings among the mountainous wastes of Yun Nan,
the spiritual atmosphere of China penetrated my consciousness, thanks to
the absence of any intellectual impertinences from the organ of
knowledge. The Tao Teh King revealed its simplicity and sublimity to my
soul, little by little, as the conditions of my physical, no less than
of my spiritual life, penetrated the sanctuaries of my spirit. The
philosophy of Lao Tze communicated itself to me, in despite of the
persistent efforts of my mind to compel it to conform with my
preconceived notions of what the text must mean. This process, having
thus taken root in my innermost intuition during those tremendous months
of wandering Yun Nan, grew continually throughout succeeding years.
Whenever I found myself able once more to withdraw myself from the
dissipations and distractions which contact with civilisation forces
upon a man, no matter how vigorously he may struggle against their
insolence, to the sacred solitude of the desert, whether among the
sierras of Spain or the sands of the Sahara, I found that the philosophy
of Lao Tze resumed its sway upon my soul, subtler and stronger on each
successive occasion.<br />
But neither Europe nor Africa can show any such desolation as America.
The proudest, stubbornest, bitterest peasant of deserted Spain, the most
primitive and superstitious Arab of the remotest oases, are a little
more than kin and never less than kind at their worst; whereas in the
United States one is almost always conscious of an instinctive lack of
sympathy and understanding with even the most charming and cultured
people. It was therefore during my exile in America that the doctrines
of Lao Tze developed most rapidly in my soul, ever forcing their way
outwards until I felt it imperious, nay inevitable, to express them in
terms of conscious thought.<br />
No sooner had this resolve taken possession of me than I realised that
the task approximated to impossibility. His very simplest ideas, the
primitive elements of his thought, had no true correspondences in any
European terminology. The very first word “Tao” presented a completely
insoluble problem. It had been translated “Reason”, “The Way”, “.. …”
None of these convey any true conception of the Tao.<br />
The Tao is reason in this sense, that the substance of things may be in
part apprehended as being that necessary relation between the elements
of thought which determines the laws of reason. In other words, the only
reality is that which compels us to connect the various forms of
illusion as we do. It is thus evidently unknowable, and expressible
neither by speech nor by silence. All that we can know about it is that
there is inherent in it a power (which however is not itself) by virtue
whereof all beings appear in forms congruous with the nature of
necessity.<br />
The Tao is also “the Way”—in the following sense. Nothing exists except
as a relation with other similarly postulated ideas. Nothing can be
known in itself, but only as one of the participants in a series of
events. Reality is therefore in the motion, not in the thing moved. We
cannot apprehend anything except as one postulated element of an
observed impression of change.<br />
We may express this in other terms as follows. Our knowledge of anything
is in reality the sum of our observations of its successive movements,
that is to say, of its path from event to event. In this sense the Tao
may be translated as “the Way.” It is not a thing in itself in the sense
of being an object susceptible of apprehension by sense or mind. It is
not the cause of anything; it is rather the category underlying all
existence or event, and therefore true and real as they are illusory,
being merely landmarks invented for convenience in describing our
experiences. The Tao possesses no power to cause anything to exist or to
take place. Yet our experience when analysed tells us that the only
reality of which we may be sure is this path or Way which resumes the
whole of our knowledge.<br />
As for .. ..,2 which superficially might seem the best translation of
Tao as described in the text, it is the most misleading of the three.
For To On possesses an extensive connotation implying a whole system of
Platonic concepts, than which nothing can be more alien to the essential
quality of the Tao.<br />
Tao is neither “being” nor “not being” in any sense which Europe could
understand. It is neither existence, nor a condition or form of
existence. Equally, TO MH ON gives no idea of Tao. Tao is altogether
alien to all that class of thought. From its connection with “that
principle which necessarily underlies the fact that events occur” one
might suppose that the “Becoming” of Heraclitus might assist us to
describe the Tao. But the Tao is not a principle at all of that kind. To
understand it requires an altogether different state of mind to any with
which European thinkers in general are familiar. It is necessary to
pursue unflinchingly the path of spiritual development on the lines
indicated by the Sufis, the Hindus and the Buddhists; and, having
reached the trance called Nerodha-Sammapati, in which are destroyed all
forms soever of consciousness, there appears in that abyss of
annihilation the germ of an entirely new type of idea, whose principal
characteristic is this: that the entire concatenation of One’s previous
experiences and conceptions could not have happened at all, save by
virtue of this indescribable necessity.<br />
I am only too painfully aware that the above exposition is faulty in
every respect. In particular, it presupposes in the reader considerable
familiarity with the subject, thus practically begging the question. It
must also prove almost wholly unintelligible to the average reader, him
in fact whom I especially aim to interest.<br />
For his sake I will try to elucidate the matter by an analogy. Consider
electricity. It would be absurd to say that electricity is any of the
phenomena by which we know it. We take refuge in the petitio principii
of saying that electricity is that form of energy which is the principal
cause of such and such phenomena. Suppose now that we eliminate this
idea as evidently illogical. What remains? We must not hastily answer
“Nothing remains.” There is something inherent in the nature of
consciousness, reason, perception, sensation, and of the universe of
which they inform us, which is responsible for the fact that we observe
these phenomena and not others; that we reflect upon them as we do, and
not otherwise. But, even deeper than this, part of the reality of the
inscrutable energy which determines the form of our experience, consists
in determining that experience should take place at all. It should be
clear that this has nothing to do with any of the Platonic conceptions
of the nature of things.<br />
The least abject asset in the intellectual bankruptcy of European
thought is the Hebrew Qabalah.<br />
Properly understood, it is a system of symbolism indefinitely elastic,
assuming no axioms, postulating no principles, asserting no theorems,
and therefore adaptable, if managed adroitly, to describe any
conceivable doctrine. It has been my continual study since 1898, and I
have found it of infinite value in the study of the “Tao Teh King.” By
its aid I was able to attribute the ideas of Lao Tze to an order with
which I was exceedingly familiar, and whose practical worth I had
repeatedly proved by using it as the basis of the analysis and
classification of all Aryan and Semitic religions and
philosophies.<br />
Despite the essential difficulty of correlating the ideas of Lao Tze
with any others, the persistent application of the Qabalistic keys
eventually unlocked his treasure-house. I was able to explain to myself
his teachings in terms of familiar systems.<br />
This achievement broke the back of my Sphinx. Having once reduced Lao
Tze to Qabalistic form, it was easy to translate the result into the
language of philosophy. I had already done much to create a new language
based on English with the assistance of a few technical terms borrowed
from Asia, and above all by the use of a novel conception of the idea of
Number and of algebraic and arithmetical procedure to convey the results
of spiritual experience to intelligent students. It is therefore not
altogether without confidence that I present this translation of the Tao
Teh King to the public. I hope and believe that careful study of the
text, as elucidated by my commentary, will enable serious aspirants to
the hidden Wisdom to understand (with fair accuracy) what Lao Tze
taught. It must however be laid to heart that the essence of his system
will inevitably elude intellectual apprehension, unless it be
illuminated from above by actual living experience of the truth.<br />
Such experience is only to be attained by unswerving application to the
practices which he advocates.<br />
Nor must the aspirant content himself with the mere attainment of
spiritual enlightenment, however sublime. All such achievements are
barren unless they be regarded as the means rather than the end of
spiritual progress; allowed to infiltrate every detail of the life, not
only of the spirit, but of the senses. The Tao can never be known until
it interprets the most trivial actions of every day routine.<br />
It is a fatal mistake to discriminate between the spiritual importance
of meditation and playing golf.<br />
To do so is to create an internal conflict. “Let there be no difference
made among you between any one thing &amp; any other thing; for thereby
there cometh hurt.” He who knows the Tao knows it to be the source of
all things soever; the most exalted spiritual ecstasy and the most
trivial internal impression are from our point of view equally
illusions, worthless masks, which hide, with grotesque painted
pasteboard false and lifeless, the living face of truth. Yet, from
another point of view, they are equally expressions of the ecstatic
genius of truth—natural images of the reaction between the essence of
one’s self and one’s particular environment at the moment of their
occurrence. They are equally tokens of the Tao by whom, in whom, and of
whom, they are. To value them for themselves is to deny the Tao and to
be lost in delusion. To despise them is to deny the omnipresence of the
Tao, and to suffer the illusion of sorrow. To discriminate between them
is to set up the accursed dyad, to surrender to the insanity of
intellect, to overwhelm the intuition of truth, and to create civil war
in the consciousness.</p>
<p>From 1905 to 1918 the Tao Teh King was my continual study. I
constantly recommended it to my friends as the supreme masterpiece of
initiated wisdom, and I was as constantly disappointed when they
declared that it did not impress them, especially as my preliminary
descriptions of the book had aroused their keenest interest. I thus came
to see that the fault lay with Legge’s translation, and I felt myself
impelled to undertake the task of presenting Lao Tze in language
informed by the sympathetic understanding which initiation and spiritual
experience had conferred on me. During my Great Magical Retirement on
Aesopus Island in the Hudson River during the summer of 1918, I set
myself to this work, but I discovered immediately that I was totally
incompetent. I therefore appealed to an Adept named Amalantrah, which
whom I was at that time in almost daily communication. He came readily
to my aid, and exhibited to me a codex of the original, which conveyed
to me with absolute certitude the exact significance of the text. I was
able to divine without hesitation or doubt the precise manner in which
Legge had been deceived. He had translated the Chinese with singular
fidelity, yet in almost every verse the interpretation was altogether
misleading. There was no need to refer to the text from the point of
view of scholarship. I had merely to paraphrase his translation in the
light of actual knowledge of the true significance of the terms
employed.<br />
Anyone who cares to take the trouble to compare the two versions will be
astounded to see how slight a remodelling of a paragraph is sufficient
to disperse the obstinate obscurity of prejudice, and let loose a
fountain and a flood of living light; to kindle the gnarled prose of
stolid scholarship into the burgeoning blossom of lyrical flame. I
completed my translation within three days, but during the last twenty
years I have constantly reconsidered every sentence. The manuscript has
been lent to a number of friends, scholars who have commended my work,
and aspirants who have appreciated its adequacy to present the spirit of
the Master’s teaching. Those who had been disappointed with Legge’s
version were enthusiastic about mine. This circumstance is in itself
sufficient to assure me that Love’s labour has not been lost, and to
fill me with enthusiastic confidence that the present publication will
abundantly contribute to the fulfilment of my True Will for which I came
to earth. Let us wring from labour and sorrow the utmost of which
humanity is capable. Fulfil my Will to open the portals of spiritual
attainment to my fellowmen, to bring them to the enjoyment of that
realisation of Truth, beneath all veils of temporal falsehood, which has
enlightened mine eyes and filled my mouth with song.<br />
So there you are.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

“translation” of the Tao Teh King (now more usually transliterated Dao
De Jing) which, as he indicates, was rather a revision and free
paraphrase of Legge’s translation. It was finally published, along with
Crowley’s commentary, in two different editions in the mid-1970s. One of
these was reprinted in 1995 by Weiser, with Liber XXI, (a verse<br />

<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>We settled what Gods, angels, demons, elementals were some little
while ago; we also wrote of how they live, so now, insatiable Seeker,
you ask where.<br />
But surely, even as a child—did you not sing that immemorial Gregorian
plain-chant<br />
“There’s a Friend for little children Above the bright blue sky.”<br />
Simple enough. A nice flat earth: sun, moon, stars, planets, satellites
hung up to dry, with occasional meteorites and comets jazzing about to
vary the monotony; above all that, this bright blue floor based upon
Reckitts’ and advertisements for the Riviera.<br />
Just like that. And above that again, the Jew Jeweller’s hashish dream
of heaven: see the Apocalypse.<br />
A vulgarisation of Baudelaire’s still, shining, mirror world!<br />
How right Rome was when she put her foot down on great Galileo and his
upstart kind! But she did not do the job properly. She should have
brewed a bogus bogey-tale to frighten people off astronomy for ever. But
perhaps it was already too late! The mischief had struck roots too deep
for her.<br />
What had these wizards wrought?<br />
Those lovely mediaeval Charts Celestial that still enchant us by sheer
beauty and sublimity had been made mockery by those sinister adepts of
sorcery!<br />
No more flat earth on four pillars—on?—In India the earth was supported
by an elephant who stood on a tortoise—who . . . ? No floor above.<br />
Nothing but empty space with swarming galaxies; no room for “heaven.”
Simpler to call Olympus or Meru the home of the Gods—believe it or not!
don’t ask questions!<br />
Yet all the time the difficulty is of our own silly making. The most
elementary consideration of the nature of Gods, angels, demons, and the
rest, as shown by their peculiar faculties, stamps them all instantly as
Beings pertaining to more than three dimensions! Just as no number of
lines is enough to produce the smallest plain, as a cube is capable of
containing an infinite number of squares, so, far from there being no
room for heaven, there is absolutely nothing but room!<br />
Yet of course the nature of that space is for ever incomprehensible, nay
inconceivable, by any being of a lower dimension. Only when we have
succeeded in uniting our Conscious (three-dimensional) with our
Unconscious (four-dimensional) Self can we expect even a symbolic
conception of how things go on “in them furrin parts.”<br />
Speculation on such points is unpardonably profitless; I have only
devoted these few paragraphs to the subject because it is useful to
rebut the somewhat soapbox type of critic who thinks to rebut the whole
thesis “Sunt Daemones” by the snook-cocking query “Quo Stet
Olympus.”</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xxxvii-deathfearmagical-memory">Chapter XXXVII:
Death—Fear—“Magical Memory”</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You ask me, very naturally, for details of the promise of Nuit (AL I,
58) “…certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; …”<br />
In the first place, I think that it means what it says. There may be,
probably is, some Qabalistic inner meaning: Those four nouns most
assuredly look as if there were; but I don’t feel at all sure what the
Greek (or Hebrew, or Arabic) words would be; in any case, I have not yet
made any attempt in this direction.<br />
To the straightforward promise, then! Certainly no word more reassuring
could be given. But avoid anxiety, of course; remember “without lust of
result,” and AL III, 16: “Deem not too eagerly to catch the promises; …”
Now, full speed ahead!<br />
Like most promises of this type, it is, one must suppose,
conditional.<br />
Such a power is clearly of the Siddhi; and my instinct tells me that it
is a result of devotion to Our Lady of the Stars. Somehow I can’t think
of it as a sort of Birthday Present to a Favourite Nephew.<br />
“Why not?” You’re right, as usual: anything may be a “Play of Nuit.”
Still, I feel that this would be a rare case.<br />
“But doesn’t everything have to happen to everybody?” Yes, of course, in
a sense; but don’t keep on interrupting! I was coming to something
interesting.<br />
I insist of putting forth the immediately useful point of view:
“devotion to Nuit” must mean the eager pursuit of the fulfilment of all
possibilities, however unpleasant.<br />
Good: now see how logical this is.” For how else could one have
reasonable “certainty,” as contrary with “faith” (=interior conviction),
otherwise than by the acquisition of the “Magical Memory”—the memory of
former lives. And this must evidently include that of former deaths.
Indeed “Freudian forgetfulness” is very pertinacious on such themes; the
shock of death makes it a matter of displaying the most formidable
courage to go over in one’s mind the incidents of previous deaths. You
recall the Buddhist “Ten Impurities;”—The Drowned Corpse, the
Gnawed-by-wild-beasts-Corpse, and the rest.<br />
Magick (though I says it as shouldn’t) gives a very full and elaborate
account of this Memory, and Liber CMXIII (Thisarb) a sound Official
Instruction on the two main methods of acquiring this faculty.<br />
(None of my writings, by the way, deal with the First Method; this is
because I could never make any headway with it; none at all. F.’. Iehi
Aour, on the other hand, was a wizard at it; he thought that some people
could use that way, and others not: born so.<br />
If it should happen that you have that faculty, and no gift at all for
the other, it’s just too bad; you’d better buzz off, and get another
Holy Guru less one-legged.)<br />
There are, however, as I find on reading over what I have written else-
where, quite a few lacunae in the exposition; and I may as well now do
my best to stop one or two obvious gaps.<br />
The period of my life which was the climax of my work on this subject is
those weeks of Thaumaturgy on the Hudson River—I fear the Magical Diary
The Hermit of Aesopus Island is irretrievably lost— when I was shown the
Codex of the Tao Teh King from which my (still unpublished) translation
is taken, and when the veil was no more than a shimmering, scintillating
gossamer, translucent to the ineffable glory that glows behind it. For
in those weeks I was able to remember and record a really considerable
number of past lives. (I half believe, and hope, that the relevant
passages were copied into one of my Cefalu diaries; but who will
struggle through those still extant on the chance?)<br />
“But what about the intervals?” you ask, Shabash! Rem acu
tetigisti.1<br />
It strikes me with immense and poignant power a right shrewd blow—what
of the other side? What of the periods between successive
incarnations?<br />
Let us look back for a moment to Little Essays Toward Truth and see what
it says about the Fabric of a man. (No, I’m not dodging your query: I’ll
get there in my own good time. Let a fellow breathe!)<br />
Nothing to our purpose, as your smiling shake of the head advises me.
And yet—The theory is that the Supernal Triad constitutes (or, rather,
is an image of) the “eternal” Essence of a man; that is, it is the
positive expression of that ultimate “Point of View” which is and is not
and neither is nor is not etc. Quite indestructible.<br />
Now when a man spends his life (a) building up and developing the six
Sephiroth of the Ruach so that they cohere closely in proper balance and
relation, (b) in forging, developing and maintaining a link of steel
between this solid Ruach and that Triad, Death merely means the dropping
off of the Nephesch (Malkuth) so that the man takes over his instrument
of Mind (Ruach) with him to his next suitably chosen vehicle. The
tendency of the Ruach is of course to disintegrate more or less rapidly
under the impact of its new experiences of after-death conditions.
(Hence the supposed Messages from the Mighty Dead, usually
Wish-phantasms or outbreaks of the during-life-suppressed Subconscious,
often very nasty. The “Medium” gets into communication with the “Shells
of the Dead”—Qliphoth, the Qabalah calls them. A month or so, perhaps a
year or so in the case of minds very solidly constructed or very
passionately attached, and the Shells’ “Messages” begin to be less and
less coherent, more and more fragmentary, more murderously modified by
the experiences it has met in its aimless wanderings. Soon it is
altogether broken up, and no more is heard of it.)<br />
It is therefore of the very first importance to train the mind in every
possible way, and to bind it to the Higher Principles by steady, by
constant, by flaming Aspiration, fortified by the sternest discipline,
and by continuously reformulated Oaths.<br />
Such a man will be fully occupied after his death with the unremitting
search for his new instrument; he will brush aside—as he has made a
habit of doing during life—the innumerable lures of “Reward” and the
like. (I am not going to ask you to waste any time on the fantastic
fairy tales of Devachan, Kama Loka and the rest; this must come up if
you want to know about Paccheka-Buddhas, Skooshoks, the Brahma-lokas and
so on—but not now, please!)<br />
There is one Oath more important than all the rest put together, from
the point of view of the A.’. A.’.<br />
You swear to refuse all the “rewards,” to acquire your new vehicle
without a moment’s delay, so that you may carry on your work of helping
Mankind with the minimum of interruption. Like all true Magical Oaths,
it is certain of success.<br />
So then we have a man not only very well prepared to reincarnate at
once—this means about six months after his death, for his vehicle will
be a foetus about three months old, but to extirpate more deliberately
all impressions that may assail its integrity.<br />
Alternatively, there may be something in the nature of such impressions
that is unsuitable for carrying over into the conscious mind of the new
man. Or there may be a rule—e.g. the draught of the waters of the River
Lethe—and it might be possible for some Adept (whose initiation is of a
higher degree than, or of a different type to, mine) to make his way
through that particular barrier.<br />
Enough of may, might, perhaps, and all that harpy brood! The plain fact
is that I remember nothing at all of any Post Mortem experiences, and I
have never known anyone else who does.<br />
There is one exception. I do remember the <em>first</em>, almost
momentary, reaction. I am in my Astral Form, in my best
Sunday-go-to-meeting Ceremonial Vestments, and with my Wand I seem to
hold this raised, attaching great importance to the act—looking down
upon the corpse, exactly as one does at the outset of an “Astral
Journey” in one’s days of learning how to do it.<br />
I recall no impression at all made by this sight; neither regret nor
relief nor even surprise.<br />
But there is one intensely strong reaction—I fancy I have mentioned this
already—when one first remembers one of one’s deaths: “By Jove! that was
a narrow squeak!”<br />
What was it that one feared? I haven’t the foggiest.<br />
And that is what I had to tell you about the Magical Memory.<br />
No: just one point to go to sleep on: suppose two or more people claim
simultaneously to have been Julius Caesar, or Shakespeare, or—oh! always
one very great gun! Well, fifty or sixty years ago or more there was a
regular vogue for this sort of thing, especially among women. It was
usually Cleopatra or Mary Queen of Scots or Marie Antoinette: something
regal and tragic preferred, but unsurpassable beauty the prime essential
as one would expect.<br />
Of the Mary Queen of Scots persuasion was old Lady Caithness, who seems
moreover to have had a sense of humour into the bargain, for she gave a
dinner-party in Paris to twelve other ladies, each of whom had also been
the luckless victim of Henry VIII’s failure to produce of his own loins
a durable male succession. (His marriages were so many desperate efforts
to save England from a second innings of the devastation of the Wars of
the Roses, from which his father, who was not a miser, but a sound
financier and economist, had rescued the country. You must understand
this if English History is to be at all intelligible to you. The tragedy
began with the early death of the Black Prince; the second blow, that of
Henry V coupled with the futility of his son and the murder of Prince
Edward at Tewkesbury.)<br />
Well, that was a big laugh, of course; it tended to discredit the whole
theory of Reincarnation.<br />
Quite unnecessarily, if one looks a little deeper.<br />
What do I mean when I say that I think I was Eliphaz Lévi? No more than
that I possess some of his most essential characteristics, and that some
of the incidents in his life are remembered by me as my own. There
doesn’t seem any impossibility about these bundles of Sankhara being
shared by two or more persons. We certainly do not know enough of what
actually takes place to speak positively on any such point. Don’t lose
any sleep over it.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

Stone irks the bladder: gout—plague—leprosy!<br />
Man born of woman is most full of trouble;<br />

But of all plagues wherewith a man is cursed,<br />
Take my word for it, woman is the worst!</p>
<p>The World’s Tragedy</p>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>“Pibrock of Dhonuil Dhu,<br />
Kneel for the onset!”<br />
for this letter is to put Woman once and for ever in her place.1<br />
But (as usual!) let us first of all make clear what we are to mean by
Woman.<br />
Not that amorphous (or rather, as the poet says, “oniscoid with udders”)
dull and clamorous lump, bovine, imbecile, giggling, truthless,
nymphomaniac yet sexless, malignant, interminable, of whom Schopenhauer
rhapsodised in his most famous panegyric: apparently his sentimental
softness understood only the best side of her.2 No! let us observe,
shudder, and lay down the pen.<br />
That makes me feel better; my duty to conscience is done.<br />
The eternal antagonism between the sexes is mere illusion. As well
suppose the male the enemy of the female screw. Understand the spiritual
reality of each, grasp their magical formulae; the sublime necessity of
the apparent opposition will be apparent.<br />
The ultimate of Woman is Nuit; that of Man, Hadit. The Book of the Law
speaks very fully and clearly in both cases. I quote the principal
passages.<br />
A. Nuit.<br />
Had! The manifestation of Nuit. [1]<br />
Come forth, o children, under the stars, &amp; take your fill of
love!<br />
I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see your
joy.<br />
Above, the gemmed azure is<br />
The naked splendour of Nuit;<br />
She bends in ecstasy to kiss<br />
The secret ardours of Hadit.<br />
The winged globe,the starry blue,<br />
Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu! [12-14]<br />
…Since I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also
thus. … [22]<br />
…And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity
of existence, the<br />
omnipresence of my body. [26]<br />
…O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speak
not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all,
since thou art continuous! None, breathed the light, faint &amp; faery,
of the stars, and two. For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance
of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division 3
is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. [27-30]<br />
Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only!
Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I
swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all
I can give, by all I desire of ye all. [32]<br />
…the Law is for all. [34]<br />
I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life,
upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy: nor do I demand aught in
sacrifice. My incense is of resinous woods &amp; gums; and there is no
blood therein: because of my hair the trees of Eternity. My number is
11, as all their numbers who are of us. The Five Pointed Star, with a
Circle in the Middle, &amp; the circle is Red. My colour is black to the
blind, but the blue &amp; gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a
secret glory for them that love me. But to love me is better than all
things: if under the night-stars in the desert thou presently burnest
mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent
flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. …<br />
…I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who
am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense,
desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within
you: come unto me! [58-61]<br />
Dictated: “the unfragmentary non-atomic fact of my universality . . .
(Write this in whiter words, But go forth on).” Ouarda4 wrote into the
MS, later, the five words as in text.<br />
B. Hadit.<br />
Nu! the hiding of Hadit.<br />
Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I,
Hadit, am the complement of Nu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs
is the name of my House. In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as
she, the circumference, is nowhere found. Yet she shall be known &amp; I
never. [1-4]<br />
I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of
every star. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the
knowledge of me the knowledge of death. I am the Magician and the
Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. ‘Come
unto me’ is a foolish word: for it is I that go. Who worshipped
Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper.<br />
[6-8]<br />
For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but
with the just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am
none indeed. The Empress and the King are not of me; for there is a
further secret. I am the Empress &amp; the Hierophant. hus eleven, as my
bride is eleven. [15-16]<br />
I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge &amp; Delight and bright glory, and
stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. … [22]<br />
I am alone: there is no God where I am. [23]<br />
I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is
joy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down mine
head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the
earth are one. There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand
these runes shall make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit
called Because, and there he shall perish with<br />
the dogs of Reason. [26-27]<br />
Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?<br />
Where I am these are not.<br />
Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console
not: I hate the consoled &amp; the consoler. I am unique &amp;
conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. … [46-49]<br />
Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in my
eyes; &amp; my spangles are purple &amp; green. Purple beyond purple: it
is the light higher than eyesight. [50-51]<br />
Lest it should all prove too difficult, I have not quoted several
passages which are completely beyond my comprehension; even in those
here set down, there is quite a little that I should not care to boast
that I had altogether clear in my own mind.<br />
Leaving out nearly everything, the only way to simplify it is to call
Hadit the “Point-of-view,” and “Anywhere” to be the radix of all
possible “Point-Events,” or “experiences,” or “phenomena;” Nuit is the
complement, the total possibilities of any such radix. You can only get
this properly into that part of your mind which is “above the Abyss,”
i.e. Neschamah: even so, Neschamah must be very thoroughly fertilised by
Chiah, and illuminated by Jechidah, to make any sort of a job of
it.<br />
But to come down from the contemplation of Abstract Reality (which,
being static and “infinite,” is ultimately immeasurable) to these Ideas
in their interaction (and thus directly observable), it is easy enough
to understand the Magical Formula of their interaction. Of course,
whatever I say can be no more than a rough approximation, even a
suggestion rather than a statement; but I cannot help the nature of the
case. Nuit is the centripetal energy, infinitely elastic because it must
fit over the hard thrust directed against it; Hadit, the centrifugal,
ever seeking to penetrate the unknown. Nuit is not to dissimilar from
the Teh described in Lao-Tze.</p>
<p>Nor would it be proper to ignore the Book of Lies:</p>
<p>PEACHES<br />
Soft and hollow, how thou dost overcome the hard and full!<br />
It dies, it gives itself; to Thee is the fruit!<br />
Be thou the Bride; thou shalt be the Mother hereafter.<br />
To all impressions thus. Let them not overcome thee; yet let them breed
within thee. The least of the<br />
impressions, come to its perfection, is Pan.<br />
Receive a thousand lovers; thou shalt bear but One Child.<br />
This child shall be the heir of Fate the Father. (p. 12) 5</p>
<p>I want you to realise that this collaboration of the equal opposites
is the first condition of existence in any form. The trouble (I think)
has always been that nobody ever looked at things from outside; they
were always at one end or the other. This is because one haphazard
collection of Point-Events chooses to think of itself as a Male;
another, as a Female. It is totally absurd to think of Winnie as a
woman, and Martin as a man. The quintessence of each is identical:
“Every man and every woman is a star.” It is only a superficial accident
that has made one set determine to function in one particular
incarnation as the one or the other. I say function; for there is no
difference in the Quintessence.<br />
Yet, since it is with a Being in its present function that one has to
deal, it needs must that one acts in practice as if “does” were the same
as “was.” ou might be described as one instance of the 0 = 2 equation,
and I as another; and any 0 = 2 is indistinguishable from any other. Yet
you and I are not identical, because all that I can know of you, or you
of me, is a presentation of a part of that 0 = 2 “Universe;” if we were
both equally conscious of that Whole, there would be no means of
becoming aware, as we are in fact aware, of that distinction.<br />
Somewhat of this is perhaps intended in The Book of the Law:<br />
… Bind nothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any
one thing &amp; any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt.<br />
But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all! (AL I,
22-23)<br />
Whoso availeth (i.e. can put to practical service) is of “presidential
timber,” so to speak, because he is able to understand the Being behind
the Function, and is accordingly not liable to be deceived by the facet
that happens to be presented to him in his Function corresponding.<br />
The case is not wholly unlike that of a man on a mountain who should see
two other peaks jutting up from a paten of cloud. Those tips give little
indication of the great mass that supports each; both are equally of the
one same planet; they are in fact identical save for the minute spire
visible. Yet he, reconnoitring with intent to climb them observes
closely only that function of each crag and icefall which is relevant to
his plan to reach their summits. He also is of that One Quintessence;
but he must fit himself adroitly to each successive incident of the
respective Functions of these mountains if he is to make the contacts
which will finally enable him to realise the Point-Events which he will
summarise as “I climbed Mount Collon and the Aiguille de la Za.”<br />
I don’t believe I can put it much better than that, and I’m too lazy to
try; but I do want to emphasise that Weininger (in Sex and Character)
merely scratched the surface. All of us, whether we are “full of strange
oaths and bearded like the pard” or “in our hours of ease Uncertain,
coy, and hard to please” do in every most minuscule sort of act exercise
both the male and female functions almost equally; the determination is
rarely more than a matter of a casting vote.<br />
It is so even in the embryo. It is much less than 1/10 of 1% that
decides whether the foetus will turn out an Alexander or an Alice.
Nature delights in delicate touches of this sort; it is one part of
Sulphuric Acid in I don’t remember how many million parts of water that
is enough to turn blue litmus red; and even with our own gross apparatus
we can arrange for a ten-thousandth part of a grain to send a scale down
with a bang. Think of a roulette ball hovering on the edge at the end of
a long spin! Think of Buridan’s ass!<br />
So, once for all, shut up, you screaming parrot! Gabble, gabble, gabble,
it’s enough to break one’s tympana, and drive a man stark staring
mad.</p>
<p>Shut up!<br />
Shut up!!<br />
Shut UP!!!<br />
These women!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. One ought, perhaps, to give an outline of how these facts work
out in the social system of Thelema. It may be useful to classify women
in three groups, (I exclude the fourth, which while anatomically woman,
does not function in that capacity: the “spinster.”) corresponding to
Isis, Osiris and Horus.</p>
<p>The Isis-Class consists of the mother-type. To them the man is no
more than the necessary creator and sustainer of her children.<br />
The Osiris-Class comprises those women who are devoted to their man qua
man, and to his career.<br />
Her children, if any, she values as reproductions of the Beloved; they
carry him on into futurity by virtue of her deathless love.<br />
The Horus-Class is composed of those women who remain children, the
playgirls, who love only for pleasure. To them a child is dull at the
best, at the worst a nuisance.<br />
Each of these classes has its qualities and its defects; each should be
held in equal, although dissimilar, honour.<br />
And what, you ask, has the man got to say about all this? Nothing
simpler; all women are subordinate to his True Will. Only the
Osiris-Class, provided he can find one of them, are of more than
transient use to him; and even in this case, he must be careful to avoid
being ensnared.<br />
But the really important issue is the recognition of each type of True
Will in woman.</p>
<p>1: Develop something here about Benny Hill to orient people toward
Crowley’s sense of humour, et al. – WEH. I have left this note as I
found it in the plaintext. I am not familiar with the works of Benny
Hill (British comedian, fl. 1970s I believe) – T.S.<br />
2: Arthur Schopenahauer (1788-1860), German philosopher. One of the
first Western philosophers to emphasise the notion of the Will, he may
have been an influence on Crowley’s development of the concept of
Thelema, although contra Crowley, Schopenhauer believed that the Will
was evil and should be denied. The reference in this instance is
probably to the essay “On Women” (in Schopenhauer’s Parerga und
Paralipomena) one of the most notoriously misogynistic rants in the
history of Western philosophy. Crowley is presumably being ironic here –

3: In the MS the word “disunion” appears at this point but it has been
crossed out and “division” written in above – T.S.<br />
4: Actually the amended reading is in the same hand as the original.
There are two points in the MS where Ouada (Crowley’s wife Rose) has
supplied a missing or indistinctly heard phrase, and the first is in one
of the lines here quoted, to wit I.60 where before “My colour is black
&amp;c.” is an insertion mark, with “(Lost 1 phrase)” in Crowley’s hand
above, and below, “The shape of my star is —” also in Crowley’s hand,
then in another hand “The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in the
Middle, and the circle is Red.” (I am not convinced that the initial ‘f’
of ‘five’ is actually a capital, but it is impossible to be certain
given the small sample of Rose’s handwriting on the MS of AL, and it is
the same shape as the<br />
initial ‘f’ in ‘force’ (III, 72) which is also transcribed as a capital)

So naturally you need a Book of the Rules, and a list of the classes of
offensive people, whether prostitutes, policemen, or verminous persons.
(I quote from the Regulations for secular Pubs!) who think the easiest
of all possible refuges from their Fear (see other letters!) is reliance
upon the mouldy mumblings of moth-eater mountebanks.<br />
Perhaps it will be best to begin by setting down the necessary
conditions for a genuine prophecy. We shall find that most of the famous
predictions are excluded without need of more specific
examination.<br />
But—priority, please, as usual, for the etymology. Prophesy means
“forth-speaking,” more or less equal to “inspired.” It has nothing to do
with foretelling the future, though it may do so, as it may do anything,
being only the ravings of a poet, drunkard, or madman. (You remember how
Saul came upon a company of youths all prophesying away together to beat
the hand, and joined the merry throng. So people said, “Is Saul also
among the Prophets?” meaning a man capable of the “divine” intoxication
of love, song, eloquence, or whatever else enthusiastic might possess
him. Men seized by the afflatus were found to be capable of
extraordinary exploits; hence the condition was admired and envied by
the average clod. Also, imitated by the average crook!)<br />
For all that, I am going for once to yield to popular clamour, and use
words in their popular sense.<br />
That seems to me, roughly this: Prediction is a forecast based on
reason, prophecy one which claims the warrant of “magical” powers. You
agree? Then we can get on.<br />
1. The prophecy must announce itself as such. We cannot have people
picking up odds and ends which may be perfectly irrelevant, and
insisting that they conceal forecasts. This excludes Great Pyramid
lunatics; it would be quite simple to do the same sham calculations with
the Empire State Building; when the architects protested, it is simple
to reply: why, but of course! God was most careful not to let them know
what they were really doing, or they would have died of fright! This
argument was actually put forward by the Spiritists when Zancig
confessed that his music-hall exploits were accomplished by means of a
code. It is quite useless to get any sense whatever into the heads of
these bigoted imbeciles. Here, A.C! don’t forget your best-beloved
Browning! In Mr Sludge the Medium, the detected cheat—it was D.D. Home
in real life—offers this silly subterfuge:<br />
Why, when I cheat<br />
Mean to cheat, do cheat, and am caught in the act,<br />
Are you, or rather, am I sure o’ the fact?<br />
(There’s verse again, but I’m inspired somehow)<br />
Well then I’m not sure! I may be perhaps,<br />
Free as a babe from cheating; how it began,<br />
My gift,—no matter; what ’tis got to be<br />
In the end now, that’s the question; answer that!<br />
Had I seen, perhaps, what hand was holding mine,<br />
Leading me whither, I had died of fright<br />
So, I was made believe I led myself.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The date of the prophecy must antecede that of its fulfilment. The
very greatest care must be taken to insure this. When both dates are
remote, as in the case of “fulfilled” Biblical prophecies, this is often
impossible.<br />
</li>
<li>The prophecy must be precise. This rules out cases where alternative
verifications are possible.<br />
</li>
<li>The prophecy must be more than a reasonable calculation of
probability. This rules out stuff like “The Burden of Nineveh”1 and the
like. Incidentally, “The Burden of Damascus” does not seem to have had
much luck so far! By latest accounts, the old burg wasn’t feeling too
badly.<br />
We may also refer to the Second Advent: “Behold! I come quickly.”2<br />
There have been quite a few false alarms to date. (It began with Jesus
himself, snapping off the disciple’s head: “If I will that he tarry till
I come, what is that to thee?” Well, somebody was disappointed.)<br />
Mrs Zancig sat on the stage, blindfolded. Her husband wandered about the
audience, taking one object or another from one or another of them, and
asking her “Ready?” “What is this?” “And this?”<br />
“This now?” “Right, what’s this?” and so on. They had worked out a list
of some hundreds of questions to cover any probable article, or to spell
its name, or give a number, as when asked the number of a watch or ’bus
ticket—and so on. One evening at Cambridge, I was explaining this to a
group of undergraduates; being doubted, I offered to do the same trick
with the help of one of them—a complete stranger. I only stipulated to
ten minutes alone with him “to hypnotise him.” Of course I won easily.
They cut out one possible way of communication after another; but I
always managed to exchange a few words with my “medium” or slip him a
note, so as to have a new code not excluded by the latest
precaution.<br />
</li>
<li>The verification must be simple, natural, unique and unmistakable.
Forced and farfetched explanations, distortions of Qabalistic or other
mathematical reasoning, are barred.<br />
</li>
<li>The prophecy itself must possess the complement of this precision.
It must be so perfectly unintelligible at the time that the elucidation
of the answer makes it certain that the prophet knew precisely the whole
riddle. I feel that this condition is itself expressed in a somewhat
oracular form; I will try to clarify by citing what I consider a perfect
example. Perfect, I say, because the “must” is a little too strong;
there are degrees of excellence.<br />
“That stele they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well
its name, &amp; it shall be to you as 718.” (AL III, 19)<br />
(The Stèle is that whose discovery culminated in the writing of the Book
of the Law.)<br />
Here the first part is still quite unintelligible to me: I have tried
analysis of the original phrase in “Scripture,”3 and nearly everything
else: entirely in vain: One can see dimly how people, recognising that
Stèle as the Talisman responsible for reducing half the cities of Europe
to rubble, might very well make reference to those original prophecies.
But, at the best, that’s nothing to cable to Otaheite about!<br />
Now the second part. This was even more baffling than the other. “Count
well its name”? how can I? it never had a name! So I tried all sorts of
experiments with 718. Shin, 300, the letter of Spirit, with our
key-number 418, looks promising. Only one more pie-crust! I kept
attacking, off and on, for many a long year, got out all sorts of
fantastic solutions, complex and confused; they simply shouted their
derision at me.<br />
It was one glorious night in Cefal, too utterly superb to waste in
sleep; I got up; I adored the Stars and the Moon; I revelled in the
Universe. Yet there was something pulling at me. It pulled eftsoons my
body into my chair, and I found myself at this old riddle of 718. Half-a
dozen comic failures. But I felt that there was something on the way.
Idly, I put down Stèle in the Greek, 52, 4 and said, “Perhaps we can
make a ‘name’ out of the difference between that and 718.”<br />
I jumped.<br />
718 - 52 = 666<br />
My own name!<br />
Why, of course, quoth he, in glee; it is in fact the Stèle of 666; for
it is the Stèle of Ankh-f-n-khonsu, my name in those past days.<br />
Oh, no! said Something, that’s not good enough! “Count well its
name”—the Stèle of Ankh-f-nkhonsu: a name is something to which it
answers, quite different from a title. That solution is clever, but it
just won’t do, because that Stèle never had a name!<br />
You lie! I shouted, as the full light broke through the mists of my
mind: In these three Thousand years it has once, if only once, had a
name, by invoking which you could bring it up before you; its name is
“Stèle 666” in the Catalogue of the Museum at Boulak!<br />
A single simple hammer-stroke, and the nail is driven home to the
head!<br />
Compare this with the chaotic devices of the “bilateral-cipher” maniacs,
by the application of which it is easy to prove that Bernard Shaw wrote
Rudyard Kipling. Or anything else! you pay your money, and you take your
choice.<br />
</li>
<li>Another strong point is that the prophecy should on the surface mean
something vague and plausible, and, interpreted, possess this same
quality of unique accuracy. For instance (although it is not prediction)
consider “Love is the law, love under will.” Yes, that sounds very well;
I dare say that is an excellent point of philosophy.—But! well, anyone
might say that. Oh, no! For when we use the Greek of the technical
terms, we find .G…, Love, and T….&amp;Alpha, Will, both of the value of
93—and these only two blossoms of the Tree whose root is 31, and the
entire numerical-verbal system based thereupon organised with incredibly
simple intricacy; well, that is an Eohippus of an entirely different
tint! It is no more the chance (if happy) statement of any
smooth-tongued philosopher, but the evidence of, and the key to, an
incalculably vast design. As well attribute the Riemann-Christoffel
Tensor to the “happy thought” of some postprandial mathematician.<br />
Here is another case.<br />
Now then this two-in-One letter, is the third Key to this Law; and on
the discovery of that fact, after years of constant seeking, what sudden
splendours of Truth, sacred as secret, blazed in the midnight of my
mind! Observe now; “…this circle squared in its failure is a key also.”5
Now I knew that in the value of the letters ALHIM,6 ‘the Gods’, the Jews
had concealed a not quite correct value of p, the ratio of a circle’s
circumference to its diameter, to 4 places of decimals: 3.1415; nearer
would be 3.1416. If I prefix our Key, 31 putting, Set or Satan, before
the old Gods, I get 3.141593, p correct to six places, Six being my own
number and that of Horus the Sun.7<br />
And one more, this time an actual prediction.<br />
Here again is what might at first seem almost an evasion! “…one cometh
after him,…” indeed! I suppose so. It fits anybody who discovers it or
claims to have done so.<br />
Not one little bit!<br />
For when the time came, and the Key was found, the finder’s name in the
Order was—and had been from the moment of his admission as a
probationer—Achad, the Hebrew word for “One.” And he came “after him” in
the precise technical sense, that he was in fact the next person to
undertake the Adventure of the Abyss.<br />
I hope you are not getting the idea that my Prophetic ambit is limited
to these high-falutin’ metaphysical masterpieces of Runic Lore. In case
you do, I now propose to break your “seven green withs that were never
dried” altogether, Delilah; for I shall keep my hair on. I shall go
forth to war!<br />
From 1920 to 1923 my abode for a season was the house called the Horsel
of the Abbey of Thelema that lieth upon Santa Barbara, overlooking the
town of Telepylus—see Homer and Samuel Butler II, but called later by
the Romans Cephaloedium, and now Cefalu. There did I toil to expand my
little Part III of Book 4 to the portentous volume now more generally
known as Magick in Theory and Practice. After numerous misadventures, it
was published in 1928.8<br />
I refer you to that book, page 96.<br />
One last word on this subject. There is a Magical Operation of maximum
importance: the Initiation of a New Aeon. When it becomes necessary to
utter a Word, the whole Planet must be bathed in blood.<br />
Before man is ready to accept the Law of Thelema, the Great War must be
fought. This Bloody Sacrifice is the critical point of the
World-Ceremony of the Proclamation of Horus, the Crowned and Conquering
Child, as Lord of the Aeon.<br />
The whole matter is prophesied in The Book of the Law itself; let the
student take note, and enter the ranks of the Host of the Sun.<br />
Note: This paragraph was written in the summer 1911, e.v., just three
years before its fulfilment.<br />
Second innings ’38 e.v., sqq.9 (It is a pity that I cannot prove my
footnote, but this Chapter XII was part of the original MS, advertised
as to be published in 1912. You may take my word for it, for once.<br />
And in any case we have the prophecy of Bartzabel, the Spirit of Mars,
in the early summer of 1910 that wars involving the disaster of (a)
Turkey and (b) Germany would be fought within 5 years.10 See the New
York World, December, 1914.)<br />
We now proceed to Magick, page 112.<br />
But now observe how the question of the Magical Link arises! No matter
how mighty the truth of Thelema, it cannot prevail unless it is applied
to and by mankind. As long as The Book of the Law was in Manuscript, it
could only affect the small group amongst whom it was circulated. It had
to be put into action by the Magical Operation of publishing it. When
this was done, it was done without proper perfection. Its commands as to
how the work ought to be done were not wholly obeyed.<br />
There were doubt and repugnance in FRATER PERDURABO’s mind, and they
hampered His work. He was half-hearted. Yet, even so, the intrinsic
power of the truth of the Law and the impact of the publication were
sufficient to shake the world so that a critical war broke out, and the
minds of men were moved in a mysterious manner. The second blow was
struck by the re-publication of the Book in September 1913, and this
time the might of this Magick burst out and caused a catastrophe to
civilisation. At this hour, the MASTER THERION is concealed, collecting
his forces for a final blow.<br />
When The Book of the Law and its Comment is published with the forces of
His whole Will in perfect obedience to the instructions which have up to
now been misunderstood or neglected, the result will be incalculably
effective. The event will establish the kingdom of the Crowned and
Conquering Child over the whole earth, and all men shall bow to the Law,
which is “love under will.”<br />
This should be plain enough, and satisfactory. However, I thought it was
time to draw public attention to these matters more emphatically.<br />
In fulfilment of my pledge given above, and of the instructions
originally given to me by the Masters, I got out The Equinox of the Gods
at 6:22 a.m., Dec. 22. 1937, e.v.; and, to fulfil my condition No. 1
(above) of a Prophecy, as well as to establish the date, I got a
reporter on the spot, with the result<br />
following:<br />
These Names Make News.<br />
Mixed Bag of Early Birds.<br />
An Englishman, a Jew, an Indian, a Negro, a Malayan—no, it’s not one of
those saloon-bar jokes—assembled on the Embankment, by Cleopatra’s
Needle, soon after 6 a.m. yesterday.<br />
They were there to assist at the publication of a book by 62 year- old
magician, ALEISTER CROWLEY.<br />
Publication occurred at 6:22 sharp, when the Sun entered
Capricornus.<br />
Crowley make a short speech; as “the Priest of the Princes” proclaimed
the Law of Thelema; handed copies of book to white, red, brown, black,
yellow representatives. Representative of the “black” race was a
dancing-girl. Indian was a non-English speaking Bengali Muslim, who
seemed rather puzzled by the whole business.<br />
Book contains message dictated to Crowley at Cairo in 1904 “by Aiwass, a
Being whose nature he does not fully understand but who described
Himself as ‘The Minister of Hoor-Paar-Kraat’ (the Lord of
Silence).”<br />
Prospectus of book says it’s been published three times before; adds,
sinisterly, that first publication was nine months before outbreak of
Balkan war, second, nine months before outbreak of world war, third,
nine months before outbreak of Sino-Japanese war.<br />
No coincidence, it says: “the might of this Magick burst out and caused
a catastrophe to civilisation.”<br />
Well, we’ll see next September . . . .<br />
“It’s a bit hard of you to wish another war on us,” I said to
Crowley.<br />
“Oh, but if everyone will only do as I tell them to,” he replied, “the
catastrophe can be averted.”<br />
“Somehow I fear they won’t.”<br />
“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”<br />
Then I issued a prospectus for the book, giving the facts as to previous
publications and their results, and leaving blank a space after “The
Fourth Publication” to wait the event.<br />
THE FIRST PUBLICATION nine months before the outbreak of the Balkan War,
which broke up the Near East.<br />
When this was done it was done without proper perfection. Its commands
as to how the work ought to be done were not wholly obeyed . . . Yet,
even so, the intrinsic power of the truth of the Law and the impact of
publication were sufficient to shake the world, so that a critical war
broke out, and the minds of men were moved in a mysterious
manner.”<br />
THE SECOND PUBLICATION nine months before the outbreak of the World War,
which broke up the West.<br />
“The second blow was struck by the re-publication of the Book in
September, 1913, and this time . . . caused a catastrophe to
civilisation. At this hour, the Master Therion is concealed, collecting
his forces for a final blow. When The Book of the Law and its Comment is
published . . . in perfect obedience to the instruction . . . the result
will be incalculably effective. The event will establish the Kingdom of
the Crowned and Conquering Child over the whole earth, and all men shall
bow to the Law, which is love under will.”<br />
THE THIRD PUBLICATION nine months before the outbreak of the
Sino-Japanese war, which is breaking up the Far East.<br />
THE FOURTH PUBLICATION 6:22 a.m., December 22, 1937, e.v. This series of
actions complies perfectly with the condition of Prophecy.<br />
Nine months elapsed, and I was able to overprint, also to reprint,
enlarged to four pages my remaining prospectuses in red ink. As follows:
nine months before the Betrayal, which stripped Britain of the last rags
of honour, prestige and security, and will break up civilisation.<br />
I have always maintained that Munich marked the true outbreak of the
war, because Hitler’s rape of Czechoslovakia, however justifiable, was
irreconcilably incompatible with our Foreign Policy; and Munich is Nine
Months to a day after my Gesture.<br />
This then I consider a completely documented case of Prophecy.<br />
And I shall be a completely documented case of Brain-Fag unless I shut
up NOW.</li>

XX + XI = 31. See O.T.O. Newsletter, No. 7-8, p. 9 ff, “Liber MCCLXIV
The Greek Qabalah” and No. 9, p. 31 – WEH. See also Liber V vel Reguli.
To clarify: the Greek letter Sigma S can also be written as C, which
approximates the symbol for the moon; a capital Theta, T, approximates
the symbol for the Sun. Shin-Teth are the Hebrew equivalents. I am not
quite clear on how Crowley reads 3.141593 from ShT + ALHIM: reducing
each letter to units gives the sequence 3, 9, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4 and there is
no way one can get the required order from that with a constant step. To
get 3.1415 from ALHIM is not a simple reversal of the order but requires
writing the numbers around an Invoking Pentagram and reading them in the
order of the corresponding Banishing Pentagram. See A Note on Genesis –

<h3 id="chapter-xl-coincidence">Chapter XL: Coincidence</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>When I was writing that letter about prophecy, I was hot and bothered
all the time by my faithful sentinel, the well-greased Hoplite that
stands at the postern of my consciousness, ready to challenge every
thought—and woe to the intruder who cannot give the countersign! This
time the dear old ruffian thought the matter serious enough to report
Higher Up. “It is put plainly enough, emphatically enough,
incontrovertibly enough” was the gist of his communication “that the
first and most irretrievable trick of the enemy is to dupe you into
passing Captain Coincidence as ‘Friend,’ whereas he is naturally the
most formidable of all your foes when it comes to a question of
proof.”<br />
Quite right, Sergeant-Major! But it is not only about prophecy, but
about all sorts of things, in particular, of course, the identification
of angels and similar problems.<br />
Well, we have captured quite a few lads of the company of Captain
Coincidence; let us have them up for examination and learn what we can
about their weapons and other warlike matters!<br />
I take our first prisoner from Magick.<br />
The most famous novel of Fielding is called Tom Jones. It happened that
FRATER PERDURABO was staying in a hotel in London. He telephoned a
friend named Fielding at the latter’s house, and was answered by Mr
Fielding’s secretary, who said that his employer had left the house a
few minutes previously, and could only be reached by telephoning a
certain office in the City at between 11 o’clock and a quarter past.
FRATER PERDURABO had an appointment at 11 o’clock with a music-hall
star, the place being the entrance to a theatre. In order to remind
himself, he made a mental note that, as soon as he saw the lady, he
would raise his hand and say, before greeting her: ‘Remind me that I
must telephone at once to Fielding,’ when he met her. He did this, and
she advanced toward Him with the same gesture, and said in the same
breath, ‘Remind me that I have to telephone to Tom Jones’— the name of a
music-hall agent employed by her.<br />
Here comes another, this time completely crazy! Nothing “Literary” about
it; no sense anywhere; a pure freak.<br />
A friend of mine, A, rang up a friend of hers, B, at her flat in Holland
Park, some 3 or 4 miles west, and a p’int to the Nor’rard, of Piccadilly
Circus. After the usual series of “they don’t answer”, “line’s engaged”,
“unobtainable”, “line’s out of order”, “line’s temporarily disconnected
at the subscriber’s request”, an appeal to “Supervisor” got her
connected instantly. Yet another girl friend, C, appears in, and
vanishes from, the story; she said “Oh, what a pity, you’ve just missed
her; she went out five minutes ago. I think she’ll be back in an hour’s
time, try then.”<br />
A waited impatiently, and rang up once more. Again the series of
nonsense-difficulties about getting the connection. At last the answer
came. This time yet one more girl friend D. “Oh, what a pity! You’ve
just missed her; she left the box not five minutes ago.” “Box,” screamed
A, “what box? Have I got mixed up in a Trunk Murder?” “Why, this box,”
replied D, calmly. “What —— box?” shouted A. “Isn’t that her flat?” “Her
flat! are you crazy? This is a call-box in Shaftesbury Avenue.” Collapse
of A’s confidence in the sanity of Nature. One may note that there was
no similarity in the names of the exchanges, or in the numbers.<br />
It is the most grotesquely impossible case of “wrong number” that ever
came my way.<br />
Now for one or two oddities. Recently, needing to relax, I borrowed
three “thrillers” from different sources. In every case, the plot turned
on two men being so alike that no one could tell them apart.<br />
(Rupert of Hentzau, John Chilcote, M.P., Melander’s Millions.)<br />
I travelled from Louisville to Detroit by a railroad whose nickname was
the “Big Four”, my object being some business connected with my Book 4.
The name of my express was the “Big Four”—it left from No. 4 platform at
4 p.m. My sleeping berth was No. 4 in Car No. 4; and my ticket was
No. 44,444. It ought to have been April 4, I suppose; but it
wasn’t.<br />
Last week a letter from me appeared in the Sunday Dispatch with regard
to the Everest Mystery of 1921. I expressed my view that the two lost
climbers, last seen on an easy snow-slope near the summit, had simply
been blown into the air by one of the sudden gusts of incredible fierce
winds which are common at those heights, and dashed to earth perhaps a
mile away.<br />
After reading this, I went to a friend’s room to borrow a book, picked
up her Shakespeare’s Histories, and, opening it at random, came
upon:<br />
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,<br />
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.<br />
Richard III, Act I, Sc. 3.<br />
Now here’s a story that’s too good to lose; not the mistiest phantasm of
an ideogram how to class it; for one thing, it’s chock-a-block with
moral lessons and economic theories and political summats; but there’s
coincidence in it somewhere, and under coincidence down it shall go.
Even if only by coincidence.<br />
From 1895 e.v. onwards I dealt with Colin Lunn.</p>
<p>“Of all the tobacconists under the sun,<br />
There is none, there is none, like the great Colin Lunn—”</p>
<p>of Sidney Street, Cambridge. When I started round the world, alas for
fidelity! I began to forget him.<br />
By 1906 e.v. the operation was practically complete.<br />
In ’42 e.v. I spent a few days with friends in Cambridge. Sauntering
along K.P. (King’s Parade to you, madam!) on my way back to the station
with half an hour or so to kill, I thought I would pop in to Lunn’s new
shop there, and pass the time of day. He might have something to take my
fancy. So I did. Needless to say, I didn’t know the shop man from Adam,
as he did not offer me a view of his identification mark. I asked after
old friends; we gossiped of old times and new; presently he observed,
putting a hand under the counter: “I think this is yours sir.” “How do
you know who I am?<br />
I’ve never seen you before.” “Oh, yes sir, I was the odd-job boy at the
old Sidney Street shop; I remember you quite well.” By this time there
lay on the counter a strange familiar-unfamiliar object —a pipe that I
had left for some minor repair before hurrying off to the East 37 years
before! I am smoking it now.<br />
And you can draw your own beastly conclusion!<br />
Here is a last, a passing strange account of a coincidence—or should it
come under “Answers to Prayer.”<br />
A young enthusiastic “Heaven Born” (=I.C.S.) parlous pious, was engaged
to an exquisite chaste damsel in Lutterworth. Praised and promoted by
his appreciative chiefs in Bombay, he felt his future sure enough to go
home on leave, marry her, and bring her out to India. At their parting,
she had given him a ring; naturally, he set great store by it.” But the
climate had thinned him; it was loose; playing with it as he talked with
a friend on the ship, it slipped from his finger, and fell into the
harbour.” He suppressed an expression of annoyance . “Well that’s past
praying for,” laughed the friend—unhappily an infidel, not a true friend
at all. The young man stiffened. “It is?” he answered solemnly and
emphatically; “We shall see.” And he retired to his cabin to lay his
grief before the Lord.<br />
The ship arrived at Aden without incident. While she was coaling, it was
the idle habit of some sailors to bait a hook with a large piece of
pork, and fish for sharks. An hour later they caught a fine specimen,
and hauled it aboard. They cut it open. No ring.<br />
I hope you don’t think I’m letting my pen run away with me:<br />
“Pens! Good Lord,<br />
Who knows if you drive them or they drive you?”</p>
<p>Indian Civil Servant.</p>
<p>No, I have not forgotten that I am here to instruct as well as to
amuse: also, to make certain observations which will, I flatter myself,
be rather new to you.<br />
I plunge headlong.<br />
Everything that happens, no matter what, is an inconceivably improbable
coincidence. You remember how you had to begin when you first came to me
for help. I said to you, “Here are you, and no other person, come to see
me, and no other person, in this room, and no other room, at this time,
and no other time. How did that come about?” The answer to that question
is the first entry in your Magical Diary: and, with a slightly different
object in view, the first step in the practice of Liber Thisharb and the
acquisition of Magical Memory.<br />
Why, hang it all; the events of the last hour, even, might have gone
just an infinitesimally little bit different, and the interview would
not have taken place as it did. Consider then, that factors stretching
back into Eternity—all the factors there are!—have each one contributed
in its degree to bringing this interview about. What a fantastic
improbability!<br />
Yet here we are.<br />
Chance blindly rules the Universe. But what is Chance? And where does
purpose intervene? To what extent?<br />
I shall now conduct you, no less firmly than Mr E. Phillips Oppenheim,
to Monte Carlo.<br />
(Excuse me! I was just called to the telephone. Somebody of whose
existence I was not aware has fallen ill in Ireland—and bang went my
plans for tomorrow.)<br />
You walk quietly into the Casino; it seems to you that the excitement is
even more noticeable than usual. You see a friend at the table “Here in
the nick of time!” he gasps. “Black has just turned up for the 24th time
running.” You press forward to plank the maximum on Red. The wheel
spins; Black again! “Forty thousand she-devils in the belfry of
St. Nicholas Rocambole-de-Ronchonot!”<br />
“But — but” (you stammer when spirits of Hartshorne have revived you)
“in the whole history of the tables a colour has never turned up more
than 24 times running!”<br />
My poor friend, what has that got to do with it? True, from the start it
is countless millions to 1 that there will not be a run of 24 on the red
or the black; but the probability on any single spin (ignoring zero) is
always one to one. The black compartments do not contract because the
ball has fallen into any one of them.<br />
Anyone who gambles at all is either a dilettante, a crook, or a B.F. If
you could get the B.F.’s to understand the very elementary mathematics
set forth above, good-night to gambling! And a good riddance, at that!
Well, there is one advantage in the system; it does help the intelligent
man to steal a march on his neighbours!<br />
In all this the important point for my present purpose is to show you
how entirely this question of probability and coincidence is dependent
on your attention.<br />
The sequence B B B B B B B at roulette is most unlikely to occur; but
so, in exactly the same degree, is the sequence B R B R R B R or any
other sequence. The one passes unnoticed, the other causes surprise,
only because you have in your mind the idea of “a run on black.”<br />
Extend this line of thought a little, and link it up with what I was
saying about the Magical Diary; you realise that every phenomenon soever
is equally improbably, and “infinitely” so. The Universe is therefore
nothing but Coincidence!<br />
How then can any event be more improbable than any other? Why, very
simply. Go back to Monte; proclaim that at Table No. 3 Black will turn
up 7 times running, after this next spin. (Or, of course, any other
series of 7.) Now you see how Coincidence links up with Prophecy!<br />
A fortiori, Coincidence is destroyed by Purpose, if, wishing to
enlighten you on the subject, I write this letter and post it to your
address, your receipt of it is no longer Coincidence. So then
coincidence must be entirely both unforeseen and unintentional; in other
words, absolutely senseless. But we have just proved that the Universe
is nothing but Coincidence; it therefore is senseless.<br />
So, having established the asymptote of our hyperbolic hyperbola, and
shewn it to be asynartete, why should we not acquiesce, and say olive
oil?</p>

XLI: “Are we Reincarnations of the Ancient Egyptians?”</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>That accursed conscience of mine has been pricking me ever since I
dashed off that rather curt and off-hand letter card in answer to yours
of the 18th. I had intended as a matter of fact to let you have the
present coruscation as soon as I could get my secretary in the offing,
but I thought I would snap your head off in the strength of your
question as salutary chastisement.<br />
I do wish you would understand that all these speculations are not only
idle and senseless because you cannot possibly verify their accuracy,
but a deadly. You ask if we, meaning, I suppose, the English, are now
reincarnating the Egyptians. When I was a boy it was the Romans, while
the French undertook the same thankless office for the Greeks. I say
“deadly poison;” because when you analyse you see at once that this is a
device for flattering yourself. You have a great reverence for the
people who produced Luxor and the Pyramids; and it makes you feel nice
and comfortable inside if you think that you were running around in
those days as Ramesses II or a high priest in Thebes or something
equally congenial.<br />
You may say that I am myself the chief of sinners in this respect
because of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, but this was not my doing. It was imposed
upon me by The Book of the Law, and I do not feel particularly flattered
or comforted by this identification. The only interest to me is the
remarkable manner in which this is interwoven with the existence of the
“Cairo working.”<br />
Your second and third questions are still worse. I should be ashamed of
myself if I were to do so much as to refer to them.<br />
That must serve for that. But your fourth question I did answer after a
fashion. It has however struck me that I might have given you a more
detailed instruction with advantage.<br />
When I was up the Mindoun Chong in Burma, I started an investigation of
my dreams; and the only way to catch them was to write down as much as I
could remember on waking, instantly. The result of doing this is rather
surprising. To begin with, I discovered, especially as the practice
progressed, that I was having many more dreams than I had previously
supposed. This might have come about in either of two ways.<br />
(1) The practice might have actually increased my tendency to dream, and
(2) the habit of observation may have brought dreams to the surface
which would otherwise have gone unremarked.<br />
In either case the figures were quite definite. I found almost at once,
that is to say after about a month, that practically every dream that I
could remember, could be quite clearly ascribed to one of two causes:
(a) the events of the previous day or days, or the subjects which had
interested and excited me during that period, and (b) the physical
conditions of the moment. For instance, a good deal of the time of the
experiment I was sleeping in what might have been euphemistically called
a houseboat. It was liable to leak; and on such occasions as I woke to
find water trickling down my nose, I found that the dream from which I
had wakened was an adventure of some sort in connection with water. (It
is quite notorious, I believe, that many asthmatic subjects are pestered
by dreams of having been guillotined in a previous incarnation. Alan
Bennett, I may mention, was one such.)<br />
As the practice proceeds, you should find not only that your dreams
increase in number per night, but also became very much fuller, clearer
and more coherent. I assume that the reason is that the fact of your
paying attention to them brings them to the surface.<br />
I am not quite sure whether this is a complete and adequate answer to
your question 4, “How can I best bring my sleeping memory into my waking
hours?”<br />
I have studied, and my secretary has studied, and we can make no head or
tail of your remark about brain exercises with sketch.<br />
Well, I must hope for the best, and leave you with my blessing.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-xlii-this-self-introversion">Chapter XLII: This “Self”
Introversion</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>“…It is a lie, this folly against self….” (AL II, 22)<br />
The English is very un-English, and the context hardly helpful. But the
meaning is clear enough; the idea is to dismiss, curtly and rudely, the
entire body of doctrine which insists on altruism as a condition of
spiritual progress.<br />
Why do I jump in with this text without warning? Because at the end of
my letter on Sammasati the Dweller of the Threshold popped up, and that
brings us to the Black Brothers, and the Left-hand path, all of which
subjects are very generally supposed to depend for origin upon
“Selfishness.”<br />
This question is one of the most critical in the whole of Magical
Theory; for in one sense it is certainly true that every error without
exception is due to exacerbation of the Ego.<br />
Yet The Book of the Law flings at us disdainfully: “It is a lie, this
folly against self.”<br />
How then?<br />
I fear there is nothing for it but to go thoroughly into the whole
matter of the “self.” This may involve some recapitulation; but then
didn’t the Buddha repeat three times every one of those extravagantly
verbose paragraphs which give the luckless Bhikku—timens, not tumens, as
Catullus says—permission to have (a) walls (b) roof (c) window (d) door
(e) hinge to door (f) fastening to door (g) h, and c.1 — no, he didn’t!
anyhow, all those ancient conveniences?<br />
“Self” is one of the trickiest words afloat. Skeat gives merely the
equivalents, all practically the same in sound, in various Nordic
languages; he doesn’t say where it comes from, or what it means. I don’t
know either, bless your heart!<br />
Latin and Greek don’t help us at all; and when we try Eastern languages,
it seems, dimly, to give the idea of the Ego, whatever that may be. Or
perhaps “that combination which is unified by Ahamkara, the”Ego-making
faculty.”<br />
Decidedly not illuminating!<br />
One can’t use the word as an ordinary noun. Skeat doesn’t even label it
as such. One can hardly say:<br />
Mr Blenkinsop’s self is good, or rheumatic, or gone for a walk. It makes
nonsense. Yet Philosophy has picked out this hapless Tetragrammaton, and
made endless mud pies with it!<br />
When one says: “I fell and hurt myself”, it’s only a conventional
abbreviation. One means “my nose,” or “my elbow,” as the case may be!
No, I can’t conscientiously admit it as a noun. More accurately: “my
body fell, and I am suffering from the injury thereby caused to my
whatever it was.”<br />
And so what?<br />
(Oh dear, I am tying ourselves into knots!)<br />
So what? Ah me, nothing for it but to plunge head foremost into the
hybrid abyss of Babu-Blavatsky bak-abak!<br />
Brahman—don’t confuse with the Brahma of the Trimurti, so so many
Nippies and Clippies are but too liable to do—is the macrocosmic
Negative Absolute, when cross-examined; its microcosm is Purusha or
Atma. Very near our own Qabalistic Zero—Nought in no dimensions—equals
Infinity (air connu).<br />
Then comes Buddhi, which curates, bookmakers’ clerks, miners and Privy
Councillors so often mistake for Buddha (Ha! Ha!), the faculty of
discrimination. Pretty much like the 0 = 2 equation in our system.<br />
Next, the Higher Manas, which is our Neschamah, as near as a toucher;
and the Lower Manas, which, as every Lovely and Cutie well Knows, is our
Ruach. The rest of the Hindu system can easily be fitted in.<br />
Note, however, the Ahamkara, usually translated “Ego-making faculty,”
which collects what it can from this dump, and labels it “I.”<br />
There seems not much point in elaborating all this. The Hindu Pandit is
a whale for swallowing numberless oceans, all swarming with Jonahs; he
duplicates and discriminates and invents at his own sweet will, in order
to get a pretty pattern with 84 or 108 crores of asankyas of lakhs of
anythings.<br />
We have done enough for honour.<br />
Enough if we see that the system is in its essence identical with our
own.<br />
Well, then, what is this “Higher Self” that you roll out upon me?<br />
Actually, we are very far from being out of the wood. This Ut, of
Udgitha, who looms so large in the Upanishads; the God peculiar to
yourself, who appears in one of the Darshanas; some Individual
constructed from the material listed above; are these all one? If not,
is the difference between them more than a quibble?<br />
Really, all these speculations are based on à priori considerations; we
had better drop the whole argument as little better than a waste of
time; nay, as worse, for it encourages one in loose thinking, and
especially in clinging to names which have no counterpart in
things.<br />
There is only one point of theory which matters to our practice. We may
readily concur that the Augoeides, the “Genius” of Socrates, and the
“Holy Guardian Angel” of Abramelin the Mage, are identical. But we
cannot include this “Higher Self”; for the Angel is an actual Individual
with his own Universe, exactly as man is; or, for the matter of that, a
bluebottle. He is not a mere abstraction, a selection from, and
exaltation of, one’s own favourite qualities, as the “Higher Self” seems
to be. The trouble is (I think) that the Hindu passion for analysis
makes them philosophize any limited being out of existence.<br />
This matter is of importance, because it influences one’s attitude to
invocation. I can, for instance, work myself up to a “Divine
Consciousness,” in which I can understand, and act, as I cannot in my
normal state. I become “inspired;” I feel, and I express, ideas of
almost illimitable exaltation. But this is totally different from the
“Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,” which is the
special aim of the Adeptus Minor. It is ruin to that Work if one
deceives oneself by mistaking one’s own “energised enthusiasm” for
external communication. The parallel on the physical plane is the
difference between Onanism and Sexual Intercourse.<br />
Probably, my reason for insistence on this point is my antipathy to
introversion in any form. The “mystic path” itself is packed with
dangers. Unless the strongest counterirritants are exhibited, the
process is almost certain to become morbid. It is only one step from the
Invocation of Zeus, or Apollo, or Dionysus, which does demand
identification of oneself with the object of one’s worship, to a form of
self-worship which soon develops into a maniacal exacerbation of the
Ego; and if one persists in this involuted curve, one becomes a “Black
Brother,” or departs for the local loony-bin.<br />
Invocations of even the most positive Gods are dangerous, unless care
can be taken to keep the personality of the god distinct from one’s own.
Athene is a superb deity; but one does not want to be nothing but
Athene, except in that supreme moment of Samadhi with Her which is the
climax of the invocation.<br />
Do you remember one of Barbey d’Aurevilly’s Contes Cruels about a
Spanish nobleman who anticipated one of the privileges of marriage
instead of waiting for ecclesiastical licence? The Inquisitor simply had
him tied to his betrothed for 48 hours.<br />
It is really rather like that! One of my mathematically-minded
disciples—J.W.N. Sullivan, I think—told me that his sinister science had
one peculiarly devilish pitfall; one is so satisfactorily equipped for
work if one had but a bit of paper and a pencil—and a comfortable bed!
He had to make a point of severe physical exercise to escape becoming
bed-ridden in his early twenties!<br />
So, even in divine invocation, one should insist on definite
communication of knowledge (or what not) which is incontestably not
one’s own. The fact that the self-begotten feelings and ideas are so
eminently satisfactory—naturally, since there is nobody to oppose
them—is damnably seductive.<br />
Once started on that road, one can easily develop self-deception to a
fine art. One can imagine that one has undergone, or achieved, all sorts
of experiences “as described in the books,” when all that one has
actually done is to work the results of one’s reading into a bubble
inflated by imagination.<br />
It should be obvious to you that the habit grows on one; every bad
quality, from vanity to laziness, lends most willing aid. One replaces
reality more and more continuously by these exciting and flattering
reveries, which by this time have no longer any shadow of a claim to be
called mystic experiences at all.<br />
It is desperately difficult to cure such conditions; the patient resents
bitterly every touch of truth, for he feels it, accurately enough, as a
thrust to the very core of his being.<br />
Parallel with this, in my psychoanalytic practice I have had excellent
success with all forms of sexual aberration, with the one exception of
masturbation.<br />
In these cases, even though I have often been successful in “curing” the
condition, so that the man has been able to carry on with satisfaction
to himself and his family the normal functions of a husband, I have
never really got rid of the peculiar mental and moral characteristics
which have been, if not implanted, at least encouraged and fostered, by
this devastating habit.<br />
Now do remember this; it is the guarantee of wholesomeness in any
Invocation that there should be contact with another. It is better to
conjure up the most obnoxious demons from the most noisome pit of Hell
than to take one’s own exhilarations for Divine benediction; if only
because there was never a demon yet so atrocious as that same old
Ego.<br />
You will discover the truth of these remarks when you approach the
Frontier of the Abyss. Well, now, if that isn’t too funny! The text of
this stupendous sermon was AL II, 22. I take this verse in its most
obvious and ordinary sense; for instance, the following sentence: “… The
exposure of innocence is a lie. …”; for that means clearly enough
Hypocrisy. So “… It is a lie, this folly against self. …” only means,
“To hell with sentimental altruism, with false modesty, with all those
most insidious fiends, the sense of guilt, of shame—in a word, the
‘inferiority complex’ or something very like it.” The whole tenor of The
Book of the Law, is to this effect. The very test of worth is that one
should be aware of it and not afraid to sock the next man on the jaw if
he disputes it!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. But what do I mean when I say “myself” in normal speech? I mean
Tiphareth, the human self as determining the identity of the Supreme
Triad plus as much Ruach as I have succeeded in organising as extensions
of it. Though your Supernal Triad is in essence identical with mine,
your Tiphareth is quite definitely not mine. It is like mine in its
nature and many of its sympathies, but your Ruach is altogether
different from mine in (at a guess) 80% of its components.<br />
We must add Malkuth as the medium which crystallizes the characters of
our respective “Selves.”</p>
<p>This is all horribly, hatefully difficult to put into words; there is
bound to be misunderstanding, however cleverly I concoct the potion. But
we understand pretty well for all that, at least so far as is necessary
for most practical purposes.<br />

handwritten note which was made completely unintelligible by a number of

XLIII: The Holy Guardian Angel is not the “Higher Self” but an Objective
Individual</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>On going over some recent letters I see that you question about
William Gillette and the Angels was indeed “a red-hot two-prong that you
stick to hiss i’ the soft of” me. You meant not only to inquire into the
order of being to which angels belong, but as to whether they are liable
to accident, misfortune and the like.<br />
The answer is that it depends on the Angel—for the purposes of this
letter I propose to use the word “angel” to include all sorts of
disembodied beings, from demons to gods—in all cases, they are
objective; a subjective “angel” is different from a dream only in
nonessentials.<br />
Now, some angels are actually emanations of the elements, planets, or
signs to which they are attributed. They are partial beings in very much
the same way as are animals. They are not microcosms as are men and
women. They are almost entirely composed of the planet (or whatever it
is) to which they are attributed. The other components of their being I
take to be almost accidental.<br />
For example, the Archangel Ratziel is lord of a company of angels called
Auphanim; and one must not imagine that all these angels are identical
with one another, or there would not seem to be much sense in it. They
have some sort of composition, some sort of individuality; and the
character and appearance of the Angel can be determined by its
name.<br />
I do not think that I have anywhere mentioned how this is done. To take
an example, let us have Qedemel—the Hebrew letters as Q.D.M.A.L, and the
numeration is 175, which is that of the sum of the 1st 49 numbers, as is
proper to Venus.1 We may then expect the head or head-dress of the
spirit to be in some way characteristic of the Sign of Pisces. The
general form of the body will be indicated by the Daleth, the letter of
Venus, and the lower part (or perhaps the quality) will be determined by
the watery Mem—The termination Aleph Lamed is usually taken to indicate
appropriate symbols. For instance, the Aleph might show a golden aura,
and the Lamed a pair of balances. Some further detail might be indicated
by taking the letters Daleth and Mem together, for Dam is the Hebrew
word for blood. From such considerations one can build up a pictorial
representation in one’s mind which may serve as a standard to which any
appearance of him should more or less conform.2 The question then takes
the form of inquiry into how far such beings are immortal or
eternal.<br />
In the above case, evidently his existence depends on that of the planet
Venus; and one might suppose that, if that planet were stricken from the
solar system, there would be no more Qedemel.<br />
But this is to judge too rashly; for Venus himself is only an emanation
of the number 7, and is therefore indestructible. {Handwritten note:
Because she-he comes from … who is [triangle] + [square], 3 + 4}<br />
It is some such idea as the above which is at the back of the
conventional idea that elementals are immortal, that they incur
mortality when their ambition and devotion causes them to incarnate as
human beings. (Is this achieved by some sort of marriage with a
reincarnating Ego? Or how? All this is very obscure; we need more
evidence.)<br />
You will doubtless have read in many Eastern stories of the destruction
of dryads or Nats by the cutting down of the tree in which they have
made their habitation. A nymph, similarly, would be destroyed if her
fountain were to dry up.<br />
Now, can an angel of this sort ever go wrong, by which one must mean,
can he ever be untrue to his own nature? I do not see how one can
imagine this to happen; for they are so completely creatures of the
elements of which they are composed that they must be regarded as
completely devoid of will in any intelligible sense of the word. Their
actions in fact are merely re-actions.<br />
They are, of course, entirely lacking in the Supernal Triad. There is
therefore no question of anything in them which would persist through
change. Perhaps it would be better to say that changed does not really
affect them. Another way to put it would be that they are adjectives,
not nouns. They are merely sensible manifestations of the elements to
which they are attributed, and to the letters of their name.<br />
Now, on the other hand, there is an entirely different type of angel;
and here we must be especially careful to remember that we include gods
and devils, for there are such beings who are not by any means dependent
one particular element for their existence. They are microcosms in
exactly the same sense as men and women are. They are individuals who
have picked up the elements of their composition as possibility and
convenience dictates, exactly as we do ourselves. I want you to
understand that a goddess like Astarte, Astaroth, Cotytto, Aphrodite,
Hathoor, Venus, are not merely aspects of the planet; they are separate
individuals who have been identified with each other, and attributed to
Venus merely because the salient feature in their character approximates
to this ideal.<br />
Now then, it is simple to answer the question of their development,
their growing old and dying; for, being of the same order of Nature as
we are ourselves, almost anything which is true of us is true also of
them.<br />
“Venus” is, of course, a “thing-in-itself;” the planet merely one case
of the idea. I have tended rather to elaborate this theme, because of
the one personally important question which arises in more recent
letters; for I believe that the Holy Guardian Angel is a Being of this
order. He is something more than a man, possibly a being who has already
passed through the stage of humanity, and his peculiarly intimate
relationship with his client is that of friendship, of community, of
brotherhood, or Fatherhood. He is not, let me say with emphasis, a mere
abstraction from yourself; and that is why I have insisted rather
heavily that the term “Higher Self” implies “a damnable heresy and a
dangerous delusion.”<br />
If it were not so, there would be no point in The Sacred Magic of
Abramelin the Mage.<br />
Apart from any theoretical speculation, my Sammasati and analytical work
has never led to so much as a hint of the existence of the Guardian
Angel. He is not to be found by any exploration of oneself.<br />
It is true that the process of analysis leads finally to the realisation
of oneself as no more than a point of view indistinguishable in itself
from any other point of view; but the Holy Guardian Angel is in
precisely the same position. However close may be the identities in
millions of ways, no complete identification is ever obtainable.<br />
But do remember this, above all else; they are objective, not
subjective, or I should not waste good Magick on them.<br />
Let me say in particular in regard to Gods, that the God Jupiter whom
you invoke is not necessarily the same as he whom I invoke. It is clear
in any case that the revelation of himself to you is modified in many
ways by your own particular sensitiveness; just as in ordinary life,
your idea of a friend may be very different from my own conception of
the same individual. Suppose, for example, he happens to be a musician,
there will be an entire side of his character to which I am practically
insensitive.<br />
You could talk to him for hours, and I would understand little or
nothing of what was said. Similarly, if he were a mountaineer, it would
be your turn to be odd man out.</p>

XLIV: “Serious” Style of A.C., or the Apparent Frivolity of Some of my
Remarks</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Alas! It is unlikely that either you or I should come upon a copy of
Max Beerbohm’s portrait of Mathew Arnold; but Raven Hill’s famous
cartoon is history, and can be told as such without the
illustration.<br />
We shall have to go into the matter, because of your very just criticism
of my magical writings in general—and these letters, being colloquial,
are naturally an extreme case.<br />
Far-off indeed those sunny days when life in England was worth living;
when one could travel anywhere in Europe—except Russia and Turkey, which
spiritually, at least, are in Asia—or America, without a passport; when
we complained that closing time was twelve-thirty a.m.; when there was
little or no class bitterness, the future seemed secure, and only
Nonconformists failed to enjoy the fun that bubbled up on every
side.<br />
Well, in those days there were Music-halls; I can’t hope to explain to
you what they were like, but they were jolly. (I’m afraid that there’s
another word beyond the scope of your universe!) At the Empire,
Leicester Square, which at that time actually looked as if it had been
lifted bodily from the “Continong” (a very wicked place) there was a
promenade, with bars complete (drinking bars, my dear child, I blush to
say) where one might hope to find “strength and beauty met together,
Kindle their image like a star in a sea of glassy weather.” There one
might always find London’s “soiled doves” (as they revoltingly called
them in the papers) of every type: Theodora (celebrated “Christian”
Empress) and Phryne, Messalina and Thais, Baudelaire’s swarthy mistress,
and Nana, Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill.<br />
But the enemies of life were on guard. They saw people enjoying
themselves, (shame!) and they raked through the mildewed parchments of
obsolete laws until they found some long-forgotten piece of mischief
that might stop it. The withered husks of womanhood, idle, frustrated,
spiteful and malignant, called up their forces, blackmailed the Church
into supporting them, and began a senseless string of
prosecutions.<br />
Notable in infamy stands out he name of Mrs Ormiston Chant.<br />
So here we had the trial of some harmless girl for “accosting;” it was a
scene from this that inspired Raven Hill’s admirable cartoon.<br />
A “pale young curate” is in the witness box. “The prisoner,” he drawled
“made improper proposals to me. The actual words used were:”why do you
look so sad, Bertie?’”<br />
The magistrate: “A very natural question!”<br />
Now, fifty years later, here am I in the dock.<br />
(“How can you expect people to take your Magick seriously!” I hear from
every quarter, “when you write so gleefully about it, with your tongue
always in your cheek?”)<br />
My dear good sister, do be logical!<br />
Here am I who set out nigh half a century ago to seek “The Stone of the
Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness:” I get it,
and you expect me to look down a forty-inch nose and lament!<br />
I have plenty of trouble in life, and often enough I am in low enough
spirits to please anybody; but turn my thoughts to Magick—the years fall
off. I am again the gay, quick, careless boy to whom the world was
gracious.<br />
Let this serve for an epitaph: Gray took eleven years; I, less.</p>
<p>Elegy Written in a Country Farmyard</p>
<p>By Cock-a-doodle-doo<br />
Here lies upon this hospitable spot<br />
A youth to flats and flatties unknown;<br />
The Plymouth Brethren gave it to him hot;<br />
Trinity, Cambridge, claimed him for her own.<br />
He climbed a lot of mountains in his time<br />
He stalked the tiger, bear and elephant.<br />
He wrote a stack of poems, some sublime,<br />
Some not. Tales, essays, pictures, plays my aunt!<br />
At chess a minor master, Hoylake set<br />
His handicap at two. Love drove him crazy.<br />
Three thousand women used to call him pet;<br />
In other matters—shall we call him “lazy”?<br />
He had the gift of laughing at himself;<br />
Most affably he walked and talked with God;<br />
And now the silly bastard’s on the shelf,<br />
We’ll bury him beneath another sod.</p>
<p>In all the active moods of Nature—her activity is Worship! There is
an element of rejoicing; even when she is at her wildest and most
destructive. (You know Gilbert’s song “When the tiger is alashing of his
tail”?) Her sadness always goes with the implied threat of cessation—and
that we know to be illusion.<br />
There is nothing worse in religion, especially in the Wisdom-Religion,
than the pedagogic-hortatory accents of the owlish dogmatist, unless it
be the pompous self-satisfaction of the prig. Eschew it, sister, eschew
it!<br />
Even in giving orders there is a virile roar, and the commander who is
best obeyed is he who rages cheerfully like an Eights Coach or a Rugger
Captain. “Up Guards and at ’em!” may not be authentic; but that is the
right spirit.<br />
The curate’s twang, the solemnity of self-importance, all manners that
do not disclose the real man, are abominations, “Anathema Maranatha”—or
any other day of the week. These painted masks are devised to conceal
chicanery or emptiness. The easy-going humorous style of Vivekananda is
intelligible and instructive; the platitudinous hot potatoes of Waite
are neither. The dreadful thing is that this assumption of learning, of
holiness, of mysterious avenging powers, somehow deceives the average
student. He does not realise how well and wisely such have conned
Wilde’s maxim: “To be intelligible is to be found out.”<br />
I know that I too am at times obscure; I lament the fact. The reason is
twofold: (a) my ineradicable belief that my reader knows all about the
subject better than I do myself, and (at best) may like to hear it
tackled from a novel angle, (b) I am carried away by the exultant
exaltation of my theme: I boil over with rapture—not the crystal-clear,
the cool solution that I aimed at.<br />
On the Path of the Wise there is probably no danger more deadly, no
poison more pernicious, no seduction more subtle than Spiritual Pride;
it strikes, being solar, at the very heart of the Aspirant; more, it is
an inflation and exacerbation of the Ego, so that its victim runs the
peril of straying into a Black Lodge, and finding himself at home
there.<br />
Against this risk we look to our insurance; there are two infallible:
Common Sense and the Sense of Humour. When you are lying exhausted and
exenterate after the attainment of Vishvarupadarshana it is all wrong to
think: “Well, now I’m the holiest man in the world, of course with the
exception of John M. Watkins;” better recall the words of the weary
sceptical judge in A. P. Herbert’s Holy Deadlock; he makes a Mantram of
it! “I put it to you—I put it to you—I put it to you—that you have got a
boil on your bottom.”<br />
To this rule there is, as usual with rules, an exception. Some states of
mind are of the same structure as poetry, where the “one step from the
sublime to the ridiculous” is an easy and fatal step. But even so,
pedantry is as bad as ribaldry. Personally, I have tried to avoid the
dilemma by the use of poetic language and form; for instance, in
AHA!<br />
It is all difficult, dammed difficult; but if it must be that one’s most
sacred shrine be profaned, let it be the clean assault of laughter
rather than the slimy smear of acrimoniousness!<br />
There, or thereabouts, we must leave it. “Out of the fullness of the
heart the mouth speaketh;” and I cannot sing the words of an
epithalamium to the music of a dirge.<br />
Besides, what says the poet? “Love’s at its height in pure love? Nay,
but after When the song’s light dissolves gently in laughter.”<br />
Oh! “One word more” as Browning said, and poured forth the most puerile
portentous piffle about that grim blue-stocking “interesting invalid,”
his spouting wife. Here it is, mercifully much shorter, and not in
tripping trochees!<br />
“Actions speak louder than words.” (I positively leak proverbs this
afternoon—country air, I suppose): and where actions are the issue,
devil a joke from Aleister!<br />
Do you see what is my mark? It is you that I am going to put in the dock
about “being serious;” and that will take a separate letter—part of the
answer to yours received March 10th, 1944 and in general to your entire
course of conduct since you came to me—now over a year ago.1</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p>666</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xlv-unserious-conduct-of-a-pupil">Chapter XLV:
“Unserious” Conduct of a Pupil</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Here pops us Zola again—this time he says J’Accuse! Today’s Hexagram
for me is No.<br />
X. Lî, the Tiger: and the Duke of Chau comments on the last line as
follows: “The sixth line, undivided, tells us to look at the whole
course that is trodden, and examine the presage which that gives. If it
be complete and without failure, there will be great good fortune.”
O.K.; Let’s! It is now well over a year since you came to me howling
like a damned soul in torment—and so you should be!—and persuaded me to
take you as my pupil. What have you done with that year?<br />
First, suppose we put down what you agreed to do: The essential
preliminaries of the work of the A.’. A.’.—you are to be heartily
congratulated upon your swift perception that the principles of that
august body were absolute.<br />
1. Prepare and submit your Magical Record. (Without this you are in the
position of a navigator with neither chart nor log.) It would have been
quite easy to get this ready in a week. Have you done so in a year?
No.<br />
2. Learn to construct and perfect the Body of Light. This might have
required anything up to a dozen personal lessons. You were urged to
claim priority upon my time. What did you do? You made one experiment
with me fairly satisfactory, and got full instructions for practice and
experiment at home.<br />
You made one experiment, ignoring every single one of the
recommendations made to you. You kept on making further appointments for
a second personal lesson; and every one of them you broke.<br />
3. Begin simple Yoga practices. This, of course, cannot be checked at
all in the absence of a careful record and of instructed critical
analysis. You do not make the one, and are incapable of the other.<br />
So I suppose you are very well satisfied with yourself!<br />
4. Your O.T.O. work. You were supplied with copies of those rituals to
which you were entitled.<br />
You were to make copies of these. Your were to go through them with me,
so as to assimilate their Symbolism and teaching. Have you done any of
this? No.<br />
5. You were to write me a letter of questions once every fortnight. Have
you done so? No.<br />
Have you in thirteen months done as much as honest work would have
accomplished in a week? No.<br />
What excuses do you drag out, when taxed with these misdemeanours?<br />
You are eager to make appointments to be received in audience; then you
break them without warning, explanation, apology or regret.<br />
You are always going to have ample time to devote to the Great Work; but
that time is always somewhere after the middle of next week.<br />
If you put half as much enthusiasm into what you quite rightly claim to
be the most important factor in life as other old ladies do into
Culbertson Contract, you might get somewhere.<br />
What you need, in the way of a Guru, is some fat, greasy Swami, who
would not allow you to enter or leave his presence without permission,
or address him without being formally invited to do so. After seven
years at menial household drudgeries, you might with luck be allowed to
listen to some of his improving discourse.<br />
Pretentious humbug is the only appeal to which you can be relied on to
respond. Praxiteles would repel you, unless you covered the marble
completely with glittering gew-gaws, tinsel finery, sham jewels from the
tray of Autolycus! Yet it was precisely because you were sick of all
this that you came to me at all.<br />
How can one take you as a serious student? Only because you do have
moments when the scales fall from your eyes, and your deep need tears
down the tawdry counterfeits which hide the shrine where Isis stands
unveiled—but ah! too far. You must advance.<br />
To advance—that means Work. Patient, exhausting, thankless, often
bewildering Work. Dear sister, if you would but Work! Work blindly,
foolishly, misguidedly, it doesn’t matter in the end: Work in itself has
absolute virtue.<br />
But for you, having got so far in this incarnation, there must be a
revolution. You must no longer hesitate, no longer plan; you must leap
into the dark, and leap at once.<br />
“The Voice of my Higher Soul said unto me: Let me enter the Path of
Darkness; peradventure thus I may attain the Light.”1</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. Let me adduce an example of the way in which the serious
Aspirant bends to the oar. This is not boasting as if the facts denoted
superlative excellence; they speak. The only comment is that if such
conduct is not normal and universal, it ought to be. Yet no! I would add
this: that I have not yet heard of anyone who has attained to any
results of importance who does not attribute his success to devotion of
quite similar quality. Here they are:<br />
1. The Cloud on the Sanctuary. On reading this book, Mr X.,2 who was
desperate from the conviction that no success in life was worth a
tinker’s dam, decided: “This is the answer to my problem; the members of
the Secret Fraternity which this book describes have solved the riddle
of life. I must discover them, and seek to be received amongst
them.”<br />
2. X., hearing a conversation in a café which made him think that the
speaker3 might be such an one as he sought, hunted him down—he had gone
on his travels—caught him, and made him promise an interview at the
earliest possible date.<br />
3. This interview leading to an introduction to the Fraternity, he
joined it, pledging his fealty. But he was grievously shocked, and
nearly withdrew, when assured: “There is nothing in this Oath which
might conflict in any way with your civil, moral or religious
obligations.” If it was not worthwhile becoming a murderer, a traitor,
and an eternally damned soul, why bother about it? was his
attitude.<br />
The Head of the Fraternity4 being threatened with revolt, X. when to
him, in circumstances which jeopardised his own progress, and offered
his support “to the last drop of my blood, and the last penny of my
purse.”<br />
Deciding to perform a critical Magical Operation,5 and being warned that
serious opposition might come from his own friends, family, etc., he
abandoned his career, changed his name, cut himself off completely from
the past, and allowed no alien interest of any sort to interfere with
his absorption in the Work. His journey to see the Head seemed at that
time a fatal interruption; at the least, it involved the waste of one
whole year. He was wrong; his gesture of setting the interests of the
Order before his personal advancement was counted unto him for
righteousness.<br />
There should be no need to extend this list; it could be continued
indefinitely. X. had one rule of life, and one only; to do whatever came
first on the list of agenda, and never to count the cost.<br />
Because this course of conduct was so rigidly rational, it appeared to
others irrational and incalculable; because it was so serenely simple,
it appeared an insoluble mystery of a complexity utterly
unfathomable!<br />
But—I fear that you are only too likely to ask—is not this system (a)
absurd, (b) wrong, as certain in the long run to defeat its own
object.<br />
Well, as to (a), everything is absurd. The Universe is not constructed
to gratify the mania of “social planners” and their tedious kind. As to
(b), there you said something; the refutation will lead us to open a new
chapter. Ought not X. to have laid down a comprehensive scheme, and
worked out the details, so that he would not break down halfway through
for lack of foresight and provision for emergencies?<br />
An example. Suppose that the next step in his Work involved the
sacrifice of a camel in a house in Tooting Beck, furnished in such
fashion as his Grimoire laid down, and that the purchase of the house
left him without resources to buy that furniture, to say nothing of the
camel. What a fool!<br />
No, that does not necessarily follow. If the Gods will the End, They
also will the means. I shall do all that is possible to me by buying the
house: I shall leave it to Them to do Their share when the time
comes.<br />
This “Act of Truth” is already a Magical Formula of infallible
puissance; the man who is capable of so thinking and acting is far more
likely to get what he wanted from the Sacrifice—when at long last the
Camel appears on the premises—then he who, having ample means to carry
out the whole Operation without risk of failure, goes through the
ceremony without ever having experienced a moment’s anxiety about his
ability to bring it to a successful conclusion.<br />
It think personally that the error lies in calculating. The injunction
is “to buy the egg of a perfectly black hen without haggling.” You have
no means of judging what is written in Their ledger; so “…reason is a
lie; … &amp; all their words are skew-wise….”AL II, 32. Let me add that
it is a well-attested fact of magical experience—beginning with Tarquin
and the Sibylline books!—as well as a fact of profane psychology, that
if you funk a fence, it is harder next time. If the boy falls off the
pony, put him on again at once: if the young airman crashes, send him up
again without a minute’s avoidable delay. If you don’t, their nerve is
liable to break for good and all.<br />
I am not saying that this policy is invariably successful; your judgment
may have misled you as to the necessity of the Operation which loomed so
large at the moment. And so on; plenty of room for blunders!<br />
But it is a thousand times better to make every kind of mistake than to
slide into the habit of hesitation, of uncertainty, of indecision.<br />
For one thing, you acquire also the habit of dishonourable failure; and
you very soon convince yourself that “the whole thing is nonsense.”
Confidence comes from exercise, from taking risks, from picking your-
self up after a purler; finding that the maddest gambles keep on coming
off, you begin to suspect that there is no more than Luck in it; you
observe this closely, and there forms, in the dusk dimly, a Shape; very
soon you see a Hand, and from its movements you divine a Brain behind
the whole contrivance.<br />
“Good!” you say quietly, with a determined nod; “I’m watched, I’m
helped: I’ll do my bit; the rest will come about without my worrying or
meddling.”<br />
And so it is.<br />
Good-night.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-xlvi-selfishness">Chapter XLVI: Selfishness</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Selfishness? I am glad to find you worrying that bone, for it has
plenty of meat on it; fine juicy meat, none of your Chilled Argentine or
Canterbury lamb. It is a pelvis, what’s more; for in a way the whole
structure of the ethics of Thelema is founded upon it. There is some
danger here; for the question is a booby trap for the noble, the
generous, the high-minded.<br />
“Selflessness,” the great characteristic of the Master of the Temple,
the very quintessence of his attainment, is not its contradictory, or
even its contrary; it is perfectly compatible (nay, shall we say
friendly?) with it.<br />
The Book of the Law has plenty to say on this subject, and it does not
mince its words.<br />
“First, text; sermon, next,” as the poet says.<br />
AL II,18, 19, 20, 21.:<br />
“These are dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor
and sad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk.<br />
”Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. They shall
rejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of us.<br />
“Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and
fire, are of us.<br />
”We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in their
misery.<br />
For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down the
wretched &amp; the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law
and the joy of the world. …”<br />
That sets up a standard, with a vengeance!<br />
(Note “they feel not,” twice repeated. There should be something
important to the thesis herein concealed.)<br />
The passage becomes exalted, but a verse later resumes the theme,
setting forth the philosophical basis of these apparently violent and
arrogant remarks.<br />
“…It is a lie, this folly against self….” (AL II, 22)<br />
This is the central doctrine of Thelema in this matter. What are we to
understand by it? That this imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness—
democracy some call it—is utterly false and vile.<br />
Let us look into the matter. (First consult AL II, 24, 25 48, 49, 58,
59. and III, 18, 58, 59. It might be confusing to quote these texts in
full; but they throw much further light on the subject.) The word
“compassion” is its accepted sense—which is bad etymology—implies that
you are a fine fellow, and the other so much dirt; that is, you insult
him by pity for his misfortunes. But “Every man and every woman is a
star.”; so don’t you do it! You should treat everybody as a King of the
same order as yourself. Of course, nine people out of ten won’t stand
for it, not for a minute; the mere fact of your treating them decently
frightens them; their sense of inferiority is exacerbated and
intensified; they insist on grovelling. That places them. They force you
to treat them as the mongrel curs they are; and so everybody is
happy!<br />
The Book of the Law is at pains to indicate the proper attitude of one
“King” to another. When you fight him, “As brothers fight ye!” Here we
have the old chivalrous type of warfare, which the introduction of
reason into the business has made at the moment impossible. Reason and
Emotion; these are the two great enemies of the Ethic of Thelema. They
are the traditional obstacles to success in Yoga as well as in
Magick.<br />
Now in practice, in everyday life, this unselfishness is always cropping
up. Not only do you insult your brother King by your “noble
self-sacrifice,” but you are almost bound to interfere with his True
Will.<br />
“Charity” always means that the lofty soul who bestows it is really,
deep down, trying to enslave the recipient of his beastly bounty!<br />
In practice, I begin afresh, it is almost entirely a matter of the point
of view. That poor chap looks as if a square meal wouldn’t hurt him; and
you chuck him a half-crown. You offend his pride, you pauperize him, you
make a perfect cad of yourself, and you go off with a glow of having
done your good deed for the day. It’s all wrong. In such a case, you
should make it the request for favour. Say<br />
you’re “dying for someone to talk to, and would he care to join you in a
spot of lunch” at the Ritz, or wherever you feel that he will be the
happiest.<br />
When you can do this sort of thing as it should be done, without
embarrassment, false shame, with your whole heart in your words—do it
simply, to sum up—you will find yourself way up on the road to that
royal republic which is the ideal of human society.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. Let me insist that “pity” is nearly always an impostor. It is
the psychic consolation for fear, the “pitiful man” really is a pitiful
man! for his is such a coward that he dare not face his fear, even in
imagination!<br />
P.P.S. The day after I had written the above postscript I came upon a
copy of Graham Greene’s The Ministry of Fear—after a long search. He
points out that pity is a mature emotion; adolescents do not feel it.
Exactly; one step further, and he would have reached my own position as
set forth above. It is the twin of “moral responsibility,” of the sense
of guilt or sin. The Hebrew fable of Eden and the “Fall” is clearly
constructed. But remember that the serpent Nechesh {Nun-Cheth-Shin} is
equivalent to Messiach, {MemShin-Yod-Cheth}, the Messiah. The M is the
“Hanged Man,” the sinner; and is redeemed by the insertion of the
Phallic Yod.<br />
P.P.P.S. An amusing coincidence. Just as I was polishing up this letter
the lady whom I had just engaged to help me with some of my work
irritated me to the point when my screams became so heartrending that
the village will never sleep again as smoothly as its wont. They split
the welkin in several places; and although invisible menders were
immediately put on the job it is generally felt that it will never more
be its original wholeness. And why? Just because of her anxiety to
please! She asked me if she might do something; I said “Yes;” she then
went on begging for my consent, explaining why she had made the request,
apologizing for her existence! She could not understand that all she had
to do was to try and please herself—the highest part of herself—to be
assured of my full satisfaction.<br />
P.P.P.P.S. “But the A.’. A.’. oath; aren’t you—we—all out to improve the
race, not counting the cost to ourselves!” Pure selfishness, child, with
foresight! I want a decent place to live in next time I come back. And a
longer choice of first rate vehicles for my Work.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-xlvii-reincarnation">Chapter XLVII: Reincarnation</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Don’t I think I ought to write a book on the Four Last Things, or
summat? I do not. What’s more, I’ll see you in Yorkshire’s most
important seaport first.<br />
But all the same you are within your rights when you insist on knowing
if I believe in Reincarnation; and, if so why; and how do I feel about
it. In other letters there is quite a lot of detail about the
constitution of Man, and there is my Essay No. 1, in Little Essay
Towards Truth; you had better get these well fixed in your mind, in case
some of what now follows should prove obscure. I can’t be bothered to
define all the technical terms all over again.</p>
<p>Do I believe in it?<br />
Yes.<br />
Why?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Because I remember a dozen or so of my previous lives on earth. (See
Magick, Chapter VI.)<br />
</li>
<li>Because no other theory satisfies my feeling for “justesse,” for
equilibrium, for Newton’s Third Law of Motion.<br />
</li>
<li>Because every religion asserts, or at least implies, it in some
sense of other. Even the Judaism—Christianity—Islam line of thought
contains some such element. The Jews were always expecting Elias to
return; the disciples of Christ constantly asked questions involving it;
and I feel that the Mohammedan doctrine of Antichrist and the Judgment
at least toys with the idea. Were I not so ignorant, I could dig up all
sorts of support for this thesis. But it doesn’t matter so much in any
case; we do not trouble to find “authority;” we put our shirts on
Experience.<br />
Now as to (1) what is evidence for me is hearsay for you; so forget it!
But there is a clear method of obtaining these memories for yourself.
See Liber Thisharb (Magick, pp. 415 422); and go to it!<br />
As to (2) it seems to me fairly obvious. The doctrine of Karma is plain
common sense; and although a terrestrial set of causes might conceivably
have their effects in other spheres of action, as of course they do, it
seems less trouble for them to remain in their original ambit. As I
pointed out long ago, the Law of Karma is the Law of Inertia.<br />
Nor is it necessary to assert that it always works out in this way;
“sometimes” is quite good enough.<br />
Besides, to say “sometimes” explains (or rather, avoids) most of the
evident objections to the theory.<br />
I grant you cheerfully that Reincarnation is a comparatively rare
occurrence; and it throws upon the objector the onus of proving an A or
an E proposition.1<br />
What is it that reincarnates? We have had this before, in another
connection; it is the Supernal Triad of Jechidah, Chiah and Neschamah
that clothes the original Hadit or Point-of-View, with as much of the
Ruach as the Human Consciousness, Tiphareth, has been able during a
given life to attach to itself by dint of persistent Aspiration. If
there is not enough Ruach to ensure an adequate quota of Memories, one
could never become conscious of the continuity between one life and the
next.<br />
Briefly, the orthodox theory as put forth by H.P.B. is that one works
off one’s Karma after death in Devachan, or Kama Loka, or some such
place; when the balance is exhausted, one may come back to earth, or in
some other way carry on the Great Work. One theory —see Opus Lutetianum,
the Paris Working—says that when one has quite finished with
Earth-problems, one is promoted to Venus, where “bodies” are liquid, and
thence to Mercury, where they are gaseous, finally to the Sun, where
they are composed of pure Fire. Eliphas Lévi says: “In the Suns we
remember; in the planets we forget.”<br />
Most of this is the merest speculation, useless and possibly harmful;
but I don’t mind relaxing occasionally to that extent.<br />
What is important is the Oath.<br />
One who is vowed to the A.’. A.’.’s Mission for Mankind, who takes it
dead seriously, and who will be neither frightened nor bored from Its
majestic purpose, may at any time bind himself by an Oath to reject the
rewards of Devachan, and reincarnate immediately again and again. By
“immediately” is meant about 6 months before the birth of the new Adept,
about 3 months after his last death. It depends to some extent, no
doubt, on whether he can find a suitable vehicle. Presumably he will
make some sort of o preparation while still alive. It seems that I
personally must have taken this Oath quite a long while ago; for the
Incarnations which I actually remember leave very few gaps to be filled
in the last dozen centuries or so.<br />
Now, dear sister, I don’t like this letter at all, and I am sorry that I
had to write it. For most of these statements are insusceptible of
proof.<br />
And yet I feel their truth much more strongly than I have ventured to
express. How many times have I warned you against “feelings?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>Note: In the original a lengthy excerpt from Liber ThIShARB (CMXIII),
from section 27 to end, was appended to this letter. It is here
omitted.<br />
1: From the context it appears Crowley means a universal (for all x,
f(x)) or negative existential (there is no x such that f(x)), in which
case we should perhaps real “an A or ~E proposition.” The point is that
on any empirical matter (as opposed to, say, mathematical expressions
which can be proved by induction) to prove such a proposition involves
examining every possible x to find out whether or not f(x) — T.S.</p>

XLVIII: Morals of AL—Hard to Accept, and Why nevertheless we Must
Concur</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>No man alive can appreciate better than myself the difficulties
connected with The Book of the Law.<br />
You ask me, if I have rightly analysed your somewhat complicated series
of questions, to advise you as to your attitude towards that Book.<br />
Naturally, if you wished for detailed explanations, I could no more than
refer you to that voluminous commentary, verse by verse, which still
awaits publication.1 But I think I can sum up the main business in a
letter of not too exorbitant length.<br />
To begin: the Author is quite certainly both more than human, and other
than human.<br />
His main aim seems to me to announce the Magical Formula of the Aeon of
Horus, and to lay down the fundamental principles of conduct that are
consistent with it.<br />
I put this first, because your troubles belong to this part of the
Book.<br />
But let me sort out the principal parts of it.<br />
(1) There is a system of the most sublime philosophy which stands
altogether apart from any Aeon, or from any other limited
condition.<br />
(2) There is a considerable proportion of the contents which appears to
refer to “The Beast” and “The Scarlet Woman” personally; but these
titles may be assumed to refer to anyone who happens to hold either of
those offices during the whole period of the Aeon —approximately 2000
years.<br />
(3) The sex morality of the Book is not very different from that
maintained secretly by aristocrats since the world began. It is the
system natural to anyone who has psychoanalysed away all his complexes,
repressions, fixations and phobias.<br />
(4) As matriarchy reflected the Formula of the Aeon of Isis, and
patriarchy that of Osiris, so does the rule of the “Crowned and
Conquering Child” express that of Horus. The family, the clan, the state
count for nothing; the Individual is the Autarch.<br />
(5) The Book announces a new dichotomy in human society; there is the
master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the “lone wolf”
and the herd. (Nietzsche may be regarded as one of our prophets; to a
much less extent, de Gobineau.) Hitler’s “Herrenvolk” is a not too
dissimilar an idea; but there is no volk about it; and if there were, it
would certainly not be the routine-loving, uniformed-obsessed,
law-abiding, refuge-seeking German; the Briton, especially the Celt, a
natural anarchist, is much nearer the mark. Britons will never get
together about anything unless and until each one of them feels himself
directly threatened.<br />
Now here I must tell you a story which may throw a good deal of light on
much that is obscure in the political situation of ‘25 to date. The
venerable lady (S.H. Soror I.W.E. 8° = 3° 2) who, on the death of S.H.
Frater 8° = 3° Otto Gebhardi, succeeded him as my representative in
Germany (note that all this pertains to the A.’. A.’.; the O.T.O. is not
directly concerned) attained the Grade of Hermit (AL I, 40). Watching
the situation in Europe, she became constantly more convinced that Adolf
Hitler was her “Magical child;” and she conceived it to be her duty to
devote her life (for the Hermit “gives only of his Light unto men”) to
his Magical Education. Knowing that the hegemony of the world would fall
to the nation that first accepted the Law of Thelema, she made haste to
put the Book of the Law in the hands of her “child.” Upon him it most
undoubtedly made the deepest impression, especially as she swore him
most solemnly to secrecy as to the source of his power. (Obviously, he
would not wish to share it with other.). From time to time, when
circumstances suggested it, she wrote to him, enclosing pertinent
sections of my commentary, of which I had given her a copy at the time
of the “Zeugnis.”+<br />
Had Hitler been a less abnormal character, no great “Mischief,” or at
least a very different kind of “mischief,” might have come of it. I
think you have read Hitler speaks—if not, do so—his private conversation
abounds in what sound almost like actual quotations from the Book of the
Law. But the public man’s private conversation can be repeated on the
platform only at the risk of his political life; and he served up to the
people only such concoctions as would tickle their gross palates. Worse
still, he was the slave of his prophetic frenzy; he had not undertaken
the balancing regimen of the Curriculum of A.’.A.’.; and, worst of all,
he was very far indeed from being a full initiate, even in the loosest
sense of the term. His Weltanschauung was accordingly a mass of personal
and political prejudice; he had no true cosmic comprehension, no true
appreciation of First Principles; and he was tossed about in every
direction by the varied conflicting forces that naturally concentrated
their energies ever more strenuously upon him as his personal position
became more and more the dominating factor, first in domestic and then
in European politics. I warned our S.H. Soror repeatedly that she ought
to correct these tendencies; but she already saw the success of her
plans within her grasp, and refused to believe that this success itself
would alarm the world into combining to destroy him. “But we have the
Book,” she confidently retorted, failing to see that the other powers in
extremity would be compelled to adopt those identical principles. Of
course, as you know, it has happened as I foresaw; only a remnant of
piety-purified Prelates and sloppy sentimentalists still hold out
against the Book of the Law, sabotage the victory, and will turn the
Peace into a shambles of surrender if we are fools enough to give ear to
their caterwauling—as in the story of the highlyesteemed tomcat, when at
last one of his fans obtained an interview; “all he could do was to talk
about his operation.”<br />
The “Master” roughly denotes the able, the adventurous, welcoming
responsibility. The “slave:” his motto is “Safety first,” with all that
this implies. Race, birth, breeding etc. are important but not
absolutely essential factors.<br />
† “Zeugnis der Suchenden:” a declaration she had signed in 1925. Has
this digression seemed too long? Ah, but it isn’t a digression. Rightly
considered, it strikes at the heart of your “difficulties.”<br />
“The Book of the Law takes us back to primitive savagery,” you say.
Well, where are we?<br />
We’re at Guernica, Lidice, Oradour-sur-Glane, Rotterdam and hundreds of
other crimes, to say nothing of Concentration-camp, Stalag, and a
million lesser horrors and abominations, inconceivable by the most
diseased and inflamed Sadistic imagination forty years ago.<br />
You disagree with Aiwass—so do all of us. The trouble is that He can
say: “But I’m not arguing; I’m telling you.”<br />
Now then let us look a little more deeply (and I hope more clearly) into
his Ethics, with our minds undismayed by any human emotion.<br />
Aiwass is of a different Order of Being from ourselves. Consider a
gold-refiner. “Analysis shows 20% of copper in this sample; I’ll beat it
in a current of oxygen; that will oxidize the copper. Shake it up with
sulphuric acid; then we wash away the copper sulphate, and that’s that.”
He does not consider how the copper feels about it; indeed, he doesn’t
believe that the copper knows about it at all.<br />
Yes, yes, of course; I know that’s an extreme case. I only bring it in
to sow what could be done as a last resort, if pushed to the wall.
Fortunately, we are not so ill situated. You will, I dare say, without
my prompting, think of the surgeon and the schoolmaster; but I can go
one better. We have in recent history a case almost precisely
parallel.<br />
How did I begin this letter? By defining the task of the Author: to
announce the Magical Formula of the Aeon of Horus and so on. In other
words, to train mankind to the use of a new source of power.<br />
Page Professor Röntgen! Page the Curies!<br />
How many “Martyrs to X-ray dermatitis?” Willing experimenters who knew
the risks? Not all of them; lots of patients got burnt in utmost agony
of death. How many victims were there of the “radium bomb?” (At Guy’s,
wasn’t it?) It always has to happen, even with well-tried tools, and
despite utmost precautions. How many workmen’s lives did the Forth
Bridge cost? You know, I suppose, that a certain number of fatal
accidents are always included in the calculations of any project of
Public Works.<br />
But a new Magical Formula is on a vastly bigger scale. Cast your mind
for a moment back to the last occasion, when Osiris succeeded to Isis.
In that great cataclysm not only Empires, but civilisations crashed one
after another. Three quarters of the Aeon had elapsed before the wine of
that vintage was really drinkable.<br />
I expect as I hope that this time (communication being universally
better established, the foundations better laid, and things in general
moving quicker) we may be able to enjoy the harvest in very much less
time. But hang it all! it’s hardly reasonable to expect complete
fruition after only 40 years.<br />
What seems to me the most encouraging symptom of all is this: the Book
itself, and the system of Magick based thereon, and the bankruptcy of
all previous systems (as set forth in Eight Lectures on Yoga, Magick,
The Book of Thoth, and other similar works) do furnish us all with a
clear, concise practical Method (free from all contamination of the
humbug of faith and superstition) whereby any one of us may attain to
“the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,” and that
the many other Beings of intelligence and power indefinitely more
exalted than anything which we recognise as human—and, let us hope,
capable of bestowing upon us a modicum of Wisdom adequate to get us out
of the quagmire into which the crisis has temporarily plunged us
all!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. It has seemed better to make a postscript of the most important
argument of all; for it is completely separate. It is this. The Book’s
meaning is “…not only in the English…” etc. (AL I, 36: I, 46: I, 54 -55:
II, 76: III, 16: III, 39: III, 47: III, 63-68; and III, 73) ). These
passages make it clear that there is a secret interpretation, which,
being hidden as it is hidden, is presumably of even graver importance
than the text as it stands. Such passages as I have been able to
decipher confirm this view; so also does the discovery of the key number
31 by Frater Achad.3 We must also expect a genius to arise who will
accomplish all this work for us. Again we know that much information of
the utmost value has been given through the Hebrew, the Greek and very
probably the Arabic Qabalah.<br />
There is only one logical conclusion of these premises. We know (a) the
Book means more than it appears to mean, (b) this inner meaning may
modify, or even reverse, the outer meaning, (c) what we do understand
convinces us that the Author of the Book is indeed what he claims to be;
and, therefore, we must accept the Book as the Canon of Truth, seeking
patiently for further enlightenment.<br />
This last point is of especial virtue: see AL III, 63-68. The value to
you of the Book varies directly with the degree of your own
initiation.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-xlix-thelemic-morality">Chapter XLIX: Thelemic
Morality</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Right glad am I to hear that thy have so astutely detected the bulk
of my remarks on morals as little better than plain sophistry.<br />
“After all,” you tell me, “there is for every one of us an instinct, at
least, of what is ‘right’ and what is wrong,” And it is plain enough
that you understand the validity of this sense in itself, in its own
right, wholly independent of any Codes or systems whatsoever.<br />
Of what, then, is this instinct the hieroglyph? Our destructive
criticism is perfect as regards teleology; nobody knows what to do in
order to act “for the best.” Even the greatest Chess Master cannot be
sure how his new pet variation will turn out in practice; and the
chessboard is surely an admirable type of a limited “universe of
discourse” and “field of action.” (I must write you one day about Cause
and Effect in magical practice.)<br />
I seem to have started up this rock chimney with the wrong leg! What I
am trying to write is a sort of answer to your remark about “Does the
end justify the means?” and I had better tackle it
straightforwardly.<br />
Cesspools in every theologian’s back garden: sewers in every
legislator’s garden city: there is no end to the literature of the
subject. But one point is amusing; the Jesuits have always been accused
of answering that question in the affirmative, apparently for no better
reason than that their doctrine is unanimously adverse to admitting it.
(People are like that! They say that I spent months in Yucatan—the only
province in Mexico that I did not visit. They say that my home is a
Tibetan monastery; and Tibet is almost the only country in East and
Central Asia that my feet have never trodden. They say that I lived for
years in Capri—the only town in Italy, of those that I know at all,
where I spent less than 48 hours.)<br />
The Law of Thelema helps us to deal with this question very simply and
succinctly. First, it obviates the need of defining the proper “End;”
for with us this becomes identical with the “True Will;” and we are
bound to assume that the man himself is the sole arbiter; we postulate
that his “End” is selfjustified.<br />
Then as to his “Means:” as he cannot possibly know for certain whether
they are suitable or not, he can only rely on his inherited instincts,
his learning, his traditions, and his experience. Of these all but the
first lie wholly in the intellectual Sphere, the Ruach, and can
accordingly be knocked into any desired shape at will, by dint of a
little manipulation: and if Thelema has freed him morally, as it should
have done, from all the nonsense of Plato, Manu, Draco, Solon, Paul
(with his harpy brood), John Stuart Mill and Kant, he can make his
decision with purely objective judgment. (Where would mathematics be if
certain solutions were a priori inadmissible?) But then, what about that
plaguy first weapon in his armoury? It must be these instincts, simply
because we have eliminated all the other possibilities.<br />
What are they?<br />
Two are their sources: the spiritual (Neschamah) and the physiological
(Nephesch). Note that both these are feminine. They pertain to H‚ and H‚
final in Tetragrammaton respectively. That implies that they are, in a
sense, imposed on you from the beginning. Of course it is your own
higher principles, Yechidah and Chiah, that have saddled you with them;
but the “Human Consciousness,” being in Tiphareth, cannot control
Neschamah at all; and it has to be admirably unified, fortified, and
perfected if it is to act efficiently upon Nephesch.</p>
<p>(How exquisitely keen is the Qabalah! How apt, how clear, how simple,
how pictorially assimilable are its explanations of the facts of Nature!
If you will only learn to use it, to refer your problems to it, you will
soon need no Holy Guru!)<br />
In practice, we most of us do act upon Nephesch a great deal. All
learning, training, discipline, tend to modify our physiological
reactions in a thousand minor manners. A complete branch of Yoga, Hatha
Yoga, is occupied with nothing else. And you can have your face
“lifted.” Apart from this, we nearly all of us attend to matters like
our waistline, our hours of sleep, our digestion, or our muscular
development. Some men have even taught themselves to reduce the
pulse-beat both in rate and in volume: so much so that they have
sometimes been credited with the power to stop the heart altogether at
will. (Wasn’t it Colonel Somebody—not Blimp—who used to show off to his
friends, after dinner? Did it once too often, in any case!)<br />
Neschamah is an entirely different proposition. One of Tiphareth’s prime
assets is the influence, through the path of “The Lovers,” from Binah.
The son’s milk from the Great Mother. (From his Father, Chiah, Chokmah,
he inherits the infinite possibilities of Nuit, through the path of H‚,
“The Star;” and from his “God,” Kether, the Divine Consciousness, the
direct inspiration, guidance, and ward of his Holy Guardian Angel,
through the path of Gimel, the Moon, “The Priestess.”)1<br />
Neschamah, then, will not be influenced by Ruach, except in so far as it
is explained or interpreted by Ruach. These “instincts” are implanted
from on high, not from below; they would be imperative were one always
sure of having received them pure, and interpreted them aright.<br />
But this is a digression, though an essential one; the point is how to
decide when one’s equation is solved by “a + b,” and one feels that “a +
b” is abhorrent to one’s nature. Now do you see the point of the
digression? By “wrong” we mean anything that evokes dissent or protest
from either Neschamah or Nephesch, or both.<br />
People spoke to me, people whose experience and judgment in all matters
of Sacrifice to Dionysus had my very fullest assent and admiration; they
told me that of all drinks, the best was Beer. So I have wanted for many
years to drink it. I can’t. I once tasted a few drops on the end of a
teaspoon.<br />
They told me that wasn’t quite the same thing!2<br />
That’s Nephesch.<br />
I cannot bear to do any unkind action, however wise, necessary, and all
the rest of it. I do it, but “it hurts me more than it hurts you” is
actually true for me. (This only applies where the other party is unable
to retaliate: I love hurting a stout antagonist in a fair fight.)<br />
That’s Neschamah.<br />
What one really needs to know is whether the protest of the Instinct
should override the decision of the Reason. Obviously, one must assume
that both are equally “right;” that one’s interpretation of one’s
Instinct is full and accurate, that one’s solution of “how shall I act
for the best?” is uniquely correct.<br />
First of all, one is tempted to argue that, that being so, there can be
no disagreement; that is, on our general Theory of the Universe. True
enough! The farther one goes in initiation, the rarer will such
incidents become. Even a quite uninitiated person—always provided that
Thelema has freed him morally—should find that nine times in ten, the
inhibiting antagonism is accidental, or at least apparently
irrelevant.<br />
(Notice, please, that our conditions of the “rightness” of both sides
are rigid: the usual inhibition is a threat to vanity, or some instinct
equally false, and to be weeded out.)<br />
Wilkie Collins has an excellent episode in Armadale; his “girl-friend”
or wife or somebody wants to poison him, and gives the stuff in brandy,
not knowing that the mere smell of it is enough to make him violently
sick. So he won’t touch it. I’m not sure that I’ve got this quite right,
but you see the idea.<br />
Occasionally it happens that an infinity of minute and meticulous
calculation is necessary to decide between the duelists.<br />
This is the sort of thing.<br />
Suppose that by what is hardly fraud, but “undue influence” (as the
lawyers say) I could persuade a dying person to leave me a couple of
hundred thousand in his will. I shall use every penny of it for the
Great Work; it sounds easy! “Of course! Damn your integrity! Damn you!
The Work is all that matters.”<br />
All the same, I say NO. I should never be the same man again. I should
have lost that confidence in myself which is the spine of my work. No
need that the fraud should be discovered openly: it would appear in all
my subsequent work, a subtle contamination.<br />
But suppose that it were not the matter of gulling a moribund half-wit;
suppose that the price was a straightforward honest-to-God Bank Robbery
under arms on the highway, should I hesitate then?<br />
Here I should risk my head, and the dice are loaded against me; nor does
the deed imply “moral turpitude.” Stalin’s associates regarded him as a
martyred hero when the law of the country, less cogent that Thelema, sat
heavily on his devoted head.<br />
It would really be a little difficult; my rough-and-tumble life was the
best possible training for such desperate adventures, so that Nephesch
could not enter a protest. As to Neschamah, we nearly all of us (Thank
God!) have a secret sympathy, with the nobler type of criminal, whence
the universal appeal of Arsène Lupin, Black Star, Raffles and Stingaree.
When they can make some show of justice-on-their-side, it is easier
still: Scarlet Pimpernel and his tribe. We are now almost within the
marches of those heroes of romance that enchanted our adolescence:
Hereward the Wake, Robin Hood, Bonnie Prince Charlie. And there are, on
the other hand, few of us who do not secretly gloat over the
discomfiture of “Money- Bags.”<br />
My retort, however, is convincing and final. Robbery in any shape is a
breach of the Law of Thelema.<br />
It is interference with the right of another to dispose of his property
as he will; and if I did so myself, no matter with what tactical
justification, I could hardly ask others to respect my own similar
right.<br />
(The basis of our criminal law is simple, by virtue of Thelema: to
violate the right of another is to forfeit one’s claim to protection in
the matter involved.)<br />
So much for my own position; but let us look at the original case with
another protagonist: let us say a young Thelemite, fanatically
enthusiastic and not very far advanced in the Path of Initiation.<br />
Suppose he argues: “To hell with my integrity, to hell with my spiritual
development: I don’t give a hoot what happens to me: all I know is that
I can help the Order, and I’m jolly well going to do it.”<br />
Who is going to balance that entry in his Karmic account? Might not even
his willingness to give up his prospects of advance justify his title to
go forward? The curious, complex, obscure and formidable path that he
has chosen may quite conceivably be his best short cut to the City of
the Pyramids!<br />
I have known strange, striking cases of similar “vows to end vows.” But
not by any means such macabre fabrications as those of the ghouls at
Colonel Olcott’s death-bed, or the patient web of falsehood spun by the
astrological-Toshophical spider about the dying dupe on whom he had
fastened, Leo—I’ve forgotten the insect’s name. Well, who hasn’t? No, I
haven’t: Alan Leo he called himself.<br />
I need hardly say that these cases may be multiplied indefinitely;
nothing is easier, and few games more amusing, than to devise dilemmas
calculated to stump the Master, or to catch him bending.<br />
In fact, the “Schoolmen” wasted several centuries on this agreeable
pastime; and they enjoyed the additional pleasure of torturing and
burning anybody who happened not to be quite up-to-date with his views
on Utrum Virgo Maria in congressu cum Spiritu Sancto semen emiserit, or
some equally critical tickler.<br />
Don’t tease your pretty little head about it! Now you know the
principles upon which one must make one’s decisions, you will not go
very far wrong.<br />
But—one has to take all these things into consideration.<br />
Then—you ask—am I saying that the End does not justify the means?<br />
Hardly that.<br />
What I really mean is that these two terms are unconnected. One decides
about the “End” in one way: about the “Means” in another. But every
proposition in your sorites has got to justify itself; and, having done
so, to estimate its exact weight in relation to all the other terms of
your problem.<br />
“Confusion worse confounded?” I dare say it is; it’s the best I can do
with such a difficult question.<br />
But I am perfectly happy about it; the one important thing (as Descartes
—and Francis Bacon—saw) is that you should acquire and assimilate the
METHOD of Thelemic thinking.</p>

<p>1: Note that in this paragraph Crowley settles an often asked
question about allocation of Tarot and Hebrew Letters on the Tree of
Life in his modified system. The letters stay in their traditional
positions, and the Tarot Atu’s of “Star” and “Emperor” switch places.
Crowley identifies the influence of the HGA with the path of Gimel, and
this is more remarkable in some ways than the Tarot attribution. If the
K &amp; C of the HGA comes from Neschamah, it would be expected to flow
by the path of “The Lovers.” Perhaps there is a distinction between
unconscious influence and conscious Knowledge and Conversation. Crowley
never completely resolved some questions related to Aiwass and some
related to the objective existence of the HGA. Speculation on these
matters is not closed, and this might be a good issue for resumption of
the discussion – WEH.<br />

<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>“Details about Book 4?” This question lacks precision. I must pull a
trigger at a venture.<br />
The idea of 4 was due to my observation of St. Peter’s in Rome; it is
built with an eye unwavering from the number, as you will see when next
you go there, aware of the fact. Also, 4 means, on the political plane,
Temporal Power. (The Qabalistic Architect of St. Peter’s knew that, and
designed his talisman ad hoc.) This book was then, according to
Ab-Ul-Diz, to achieve worldly success. It is my fault if it did not;
still, these are early days to judge of that.<br />
Soror Virakam1 insisted that I should write this in such language that
the charwoman and the chimney-sweeper could understand it easily. She
pulled me up at the first hint of obscurity.<br />
This went well enough for Part I: Yoga. (And, indeed, that part did sell
rather well.) But when I had finished Part II, I discovered that not
only was the book an exceptionally recondite treatise on obscure
technical points, but was not even an exposition of Magick at all!
Magick without Tears, indeed!<br />
This was my crazed humility; I honestly thought that everyone knew all
about Magick, and how it was done, and why, and so on. There was little
to do but to erect a superstructure of symbolism. This, by the way, has
hampered me all my life, in every way; I am so aware of my own shameful
ignorance on every subject—there is no mistake about this!—that I cannot
conceive of any human being who is actually more ignorant than myself.
How could such a one endure to live, with the consciousness of his
infamy gnawing his liver?<br />
I know this sounds mad; but it’s true. Well, then, I set myself to
repair the omission with Part III; this should be a really complete
treatise on the Art and Science of magick, and it should be worked out
from the beginning, a logical sequence like Euclid. Hence Axiom,
Postulate and Theorems. I supposed even then that I could cover the
field with another volume comparable in size with the<br />
former two.<br />
I did indeed “finish” this, even announced publication; it was just
going to Press when War (also announced five years before by Bartzabel,
the Spirit of Mars) came along in 1914. I toted the rod around the world
with me (excuse my American!) and in a fatal hour of weakness,
self-mistrust, took to shewing it to some of my students. Of course—I
might have known—they all with one accord began: “Oh, but you haven’t
said anything about—” —all the subjects in the world. So I started to
fill in the gaps. As I did so, I found any amount more to do on my own.
It went on like that for 14 years! Since it came out the voices of
detraction have been dumb. I really do believe that I’ve covered the
ground at last. Of course, time shewed that Part I, although it did
really give the essentials of Yoga in the simplest possible language,
was hardly more than an outline. More, it did not correlate Yoga with
general philosophy. Eight Lectures have, I believe, remedied this.<br />
The Master (or Intelligence) who directed the writing of this Book; see
Letter.2 As to Part IV, The Book of the Law section, the idea was that
the volume should comply with the instructions given in AL III,39: “All
this and a book to say how thou didst come hither and a reproduction of
this ink and paper for ever—for in it is the word secret &amp; not only
in the English—and thy comment upon this the Book of the Law shall be
printed beautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful paper made by
hand; and to each man and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine
or to drink at them, it is the Law to give.<br />
Then they shall chance to abide in this bliss or no; it is no odds. Do
this quickly!” I mistook “Comment” for “Commentary”—a word-by-word
exposition of every verse (and much of it I loathed with all my heart!)
including the Qabalistic interpretation, a task obviously endless.<br />
What then about AL III, 40? (also see attached) This problem was solved
only by achieving the task.<br />
In Paris, in a mood of blank despair about it all, out came the Comment.
Easy, yes; inspired, yes; it is, as printed, the exact wording required.
No further cavilling and quibbling, and controversy and casuistry. All
heresiarchs are smelt in advance for the rats they are; they are seen
brewing (their very vile small beer) in the air (the realm of
Intellect—Swords) and they are accordingly nipped in the bud.<br />
All Parliamentary requirements thus fulfilled according to the famous
formula of the Irish M.P., we can get on to your other questions
untroubled by doubt.<br />
One Textus Receptus, photographically guaranteed. One High Court of
Interpretation, each for himself alone. No Patristic logomachies! No
disputed readings! No civil wars and persecutions.<br />

<p>“The Masters contacted you.” Can you by any chance mean “The Masters
made contact with you?”<br />
Assuming that such is the deplorable case, we may proceed.<br />
Firstly, the effort on my part was precisely nil, I resented Their
interference with proud bitter angry disbelief. The Equinox of the Gods
describes this in detail.<br />
But of course Their victim did not have a fair chance of escape. After
all, They had had 2000 years to perfect Their plans. As for me, I had a
traitor in the heart of the citadel; my Karma for God knows how many
Incarnations. (The acquisition of the Magical Memory, fragmentary as
that is, has thrown a great deal of light on that matter. Your letter
does in fact surmise that this is so.)<br />
You must understand that the arrival of a New Aeon knocks all the Rules
sideways. I imagine that even the very strict Magical Code of Ethics
looks like a cocked hat before They have done with it!<br />
My theory is that They chose me for (a) my literary skill, knowledge and
judgment; (b) my scientific training; (c) my familiarity with Eastern
ways, habits of thought, and sympathetic predisposition; (d) my stern
adherence to Truth; (e) my moral courage; (f) my dour persistence; and
(g) my Karma as aforesaid.<br />
They prepared me by (a) pushing me rapidly forward both in Magick and in
Yoga; (b) wearying me of both of them and making me despair of them both
as a solution to the problem of Life, and (c) fixing me both in
Buddhistic pessimism and scientific rationalism, so that their victory
over me might be as difficult and solid as achievement as possible. (I
am by no means proud of myself. Either I fought them or failed them, at
every turn.) Chapter V of The Equinox of the Gods might have been
written with more emphasis; but there are passages elsewhere in that
volume which lay great stress upon the point.<br />
Yet, after all, AL II, 10-11 should surely be enough. “O prophet! thou
hast ill will to learn this writing.<br />
I see thee hate the hand &amp; the pen; but I am stronger.”<br />
To interrupt the dictation of a supremely important document, merely to
jeer at the impotent resentment of the luckless scribe! It seemed to me
downright ungenerous, the spirit of the triumphant schoolboy
bully!<br />
But Their ways are not as our ways; this question leads us on quite
naturally to your next point, and the resolution of that know will
unravel that querulous criticism. Just as a learned Divine might chuckle
over a smoking-room story, or a heart overflowing with the honey of
human kindness wish to have the housemaid “seven years a-killing,” so
may the greatest of the Masters—even discarnate!— have a perverted sense
of humour, or a gross error in taste, (see AL I, 51) “…sweet wines and
wines that foam!…”—wines, bar Chateau Yquem and very full-bodied port,
that I dislike and despise—or any other eccentricity. Look at H.P.B.—hot
stuff, if you like!<br />
It is most necessary that you should understand what happens when on
goes from Adeptus Exemptus 7° = 4° to Magister Templi 8° = 3°. As you
see from a glance at the Tree of Life, this advance entails the Crossing
of the Abyss; and there is no Path. That means that one must jump. You
must get rid of “all that you have, and all that you are”—that is one
way to put it.<br />
The Vision and the Voice, Aethyrs XVI—end, gives an immense amount of
detail; it must be studied intensely, with diligence, with Will, and
with imagination. Not only the attainment of the grade, but the events
which go with, or come after, it; all these are described as actual
Experience. Even so, it is all extraordinarily difficult until you have
been through it yourself.<br />
But that part which answers your question is not really very hard to
grasp; it is indeed most obvious.<br />
Ask yourself: then what happens to the discarded elements of the Adept?
They cannot be left as they are, to disintegrate, or to become vehicles
for obsession. This entity which was the Exempt Adept has been built up
in years of unremitting toil, as worthy Workshop wherein the Great Work
should be accomplished. It has moreover been sanctified and glorified by
the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.<br />
So as each Master has his own appointed Work to perform in the world, he
is cast down into the Sephira, suitable for that work. If his function
is to be that of a warrior, he would find himself in Geburah; if that of
a great poet or composer, in Tiphareth; and so on. He, the Master,
inhabits this dwelling; but, having already got rid of it, he is able to
allow it to carry on according to its nature without interference from
the false Self (its head in Daäth) which hitherto had hampered it. (“If
I were a dog, I should bark; if I were an owl, I should hoot,” says
Basil King Lamus in The Diary of a Drug-Fiend.) He is totally
indifferent to the Event; so then he acts and reacts with perfect
elasticity.<br />
This is the Way of the Tao; and that is why you cannot grasp the very
idea of that Way—much less follow it!—unless you are a Master of the
Temple.<br />
Remember in any case, that not only the Adept, but anyone with the
smallest capacity for Adeptship, is fundamentally an Artist; he will
certainly not possess any of those bourgeois “virtues” which are just so
many reactions to Blue Funk.<br />
Of course, practically all of us in the West get our first knowledge
from the pious and pretentious drivel of most writers in general
circulation. So we start with prejudice.<br />
Also, asceticism is all right when it is the proper means of attaining
some special end. It is when it produces eructations of spiritual pride,
and satisfied vanity, that it is poisonous. The Greek word means an
athlete; and the training of an athlete is not mortification of the
body. Nor is there any rule which covers all circumstances. When men go
“stale” a few days before the race, they are “taken off training,” and
fed with champagne. But that is part of the training. Observe, too, that
all men go “stale” sooner or later; training is abnormal, and must be
stopped as soon as its object is attained.<br />
Even so, it too often strains vital organs, especially the heart and
lungs, so that few rowing “Blues” live to be 50. But worst of all is the
effect on the temper!<br />
When it is permanent and mistaken for a “Virtue,” it poisons the very
soil of the soul. The vilest weeds spring up; cruelty,
narrow-mindedness, arrogance—everything mean and horrible flowers in
those who “Mortify the flesh.” Incidentally, such ideas spawn the “Black
Brother.” The complete lack of humour, the egomaniac conceit,
self-satisfaction, absence of all sympathy for others, the craving to
pass their miseries on to more sensible people by persecuting them:
these traits are symptomatic.<br />
Well, this is a very brief synopsis, but I hope that it will answer your
question at least so far as to enable you to understand more easily the
account of these matters given in The Vision and the Voice.</p>

<p>P.S. On reading this over, it has struck me that you may have meant
to raise a totally different issue; that of “abstract morality.” Rather
an extensive battlefield; I will dispose my forces in array in my next
letter of “morality, heavenly link.”3<br />

LI: How to Recognise Masters, Angels, etc., and how they Work</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>I have been thinking over what I wrote in my last letter with regard
to the verification of appearances in the Astral Plane.1<br />
I did not mention a parallel question of even greater immediate
practical importance: that of one’s relations with Astral or discarnate
intelligences or with Those whom we call “The Masters” or “The Gods”:
the messages of gestures which reach us through the normal physical
channels. The importance is that they actually determine one’s line of
conduct in critical situations.<br />
It seemed therefore a good idea to give you three examples from The
Spirit of Solitude:2 and here they are!<br />
The first extract refers to the “miraculous” discovery of the MS of
Liber AL some years after I had deliberately “lost” it.<br />
The second, to the finding of a villa suited to the Work.<br />

<p>[The following is from Vol. 4 of The Confessions, pp. 369 –

It was part of my plan for the Equinox to prepare a final edition of the
work of Dr Dee and Sir Edward Kelly. I had a good many of the data and
promised myself to complete them by studying the manuscripts in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford—which, incidentally, I did in the autumn; but
it struck me that it would be useful to get my large paintings of the
four Elemental Watch Towers which I had made in Mexico. I thought these
were probably in Boleskine. I decided to go up there for a fortnight or
so. Incidentally, I had the conveniences for conferring upon Neuburg the
degree of Neophyte, he having passed brilliantly through this year as a
Probationer.<br />
I consequently asked him and an Emmanuel man named Kenneth Ward, to come
and stay with me. I had met Ward at Wasdale Head shortly before, having
gone there to renew my ancient loves with the creeds of the gullies. It
happened that Ward was very keen on skiing. I had several pairs and
offered to give him some. This casual circumstance proved an essential
part of the chain by which I was ultimately dragged behind the chariot
of the Secret Chiefs. At least I thought it was a chain. I did not
realise that steel of such exquisite temper might be beaten into a sword
fit for the hand of a free man.<br />
To my annoyance, I could not find the Elemental Watch Towers anywhere in
the house. I dare say I gave up looking rather easily. I had got into a
state of disgusted in difference about such things.<br />
Rose might have destroyed them in a drunken fit, just as she might have
pawned them if they had possessed any commercial value. I shrugged my
shoulders accordingly, and gave up the search. The skis that I had
promised Ward were not to be found any more than the Watch Towers. After
putting Neuburg through his initiation, we prepared to go to London. I
had let the house, and my tenant<br />
was coming in on the first of July. We had four days in which to amuse
ourselves; and we let ourselves go for a thorough good time. Thus like a
thunderbolt comes the incident of June 28, thus described in my
diary:<br />
Glory be to Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit in the Highest! A little before
midday I was impelled mysteriously (though exhausted by playing fives,
billiards, etc. till nearly six this morning) to make a final search for
the Elemental Tablets. And lo! when I had at last abandoned the search,
I cast mine eyes upon a hole in the loft where were ski, etc., and
there, O Holy, Holy, Holy! were not only all that I sought, but the
manuscript of Liber Legis.4<br />
The ground was completely cut away from under my feet. I remained for
two whole days meditating on the situation—in performing, in fact, a
sort of supplementary Sammasati to that of 1905. Having the knack of it,
I reached a very clear conclusion without too much difficulty. The
essence of the situation was that the Secret Chiefs meant to hold me to
my obligation. I understood that the disaster and misery of the last
three years was due to my attempt to evade my duty. I surrendered
unconditionally, as appears from the entry of July 1.<br />
I once more solemnly renounced all that I have or am. On departing (at
midnight from the topmost point of the hill which crowns my estate)
instantly shone the moon, two days before her fullness, over the hills
among the clouds.<br />
This record is couched in very general terms, but it was intended to
cover the practical point of my resuming the task laid upon me in Cairo
exactly as I might be directed to do by my superiors.<br />
Instantly my burden fell from my back. The long crucifixion of home life
came to a crisis, immediately on my return to London. At the same time
every other inhibition was automatically removed. For the first time
since the spring of 1904 I felt myself free to do my Will. That, of
course, was because I had at last understood what my Will was. My
aspiration to be the means of emancipating humanity was perfectly
fulfilled. I had merely to establish in the world the Law which had been
given me to proclaim: “…thou hast no right but to do thy will.” Had I
bent my energies from the first to proclaiming the Law of Thelema I
should doubtless have found no obstacle in my path. Those which
naturally arise in the course of any work soever, would have been
quietly removed by the Secret Chiefs. But I had chosen to fight against
myself for five years, and “If Satan shall be divided against Satan, how
shall his kingdom stand?” The more I strove, the more I encouraged an
internal conflict, and stultified myself. I had been permitted to
complete my initiation, for the reason that by doing so I was fitting
myself for the fight; but all my other efforts had met with a derisory
disaster. More, one does not wipe out a lustre of lunacy by a moment of
sanity. I am suffering to this day from the effects of having wasted
some of the best years of my life in the stupid and stubborn struggle to
set up my conscious self against its silent sovereign, my true Soul.

<p>The preparation for this was in some ways trying to the candidate.
For instance, he had to sleep naked for seven nights on a litter of
gorse.</p>
<p>[The following is from Vol. 4 of The Confessions, pp. 590 – 598.
5]</p>
<p>A boisterous party was in progress. The dancer’s lifelong friend,
whom I will call by the name she afterwards adopted, Soror Virakam, 6
was celebrating her birthday. This lady, a magnificent specimen of
mingled Irish and Italian blood, possessed a most powerful personality
and a terrific magnetism which instantly attracted my own. I forgot
everything. I sat on the floor like a Chinese God, exchanging
electricity with her.<br />
After some weeks’ preliminary skirmishing, we joined battle along the
whole front; that is to say, I crossed to Paris, where she had a flat,
and carried her off to Switzerland to spend the winter skating.<br />
Arrived at Interlaken, we found that Murren was not open, so we went on
to St. Moritz, breaking the journey at Zurich. This town is so hideous
and depressing that we felt that our only chance of living through the
night was to get superbly drunk, which we did . . .<br />
(Let me emphasise that this wild adventure had not the remotest
connection with Magick. Virakam was utterly ignorant of the subject. She
had hardly so much as a smattering of Christian Science.<br />
She had never attended a séance or played Planchette.)<br />
… Lassati sed non Satiati 7 by midnight, I expected to sleep; but was
aroused by Virakam being apparently seized with a violent attack of
hysteria, in which she poured forth a frantic torrent of senseless
hallucination. I was irritated and tried to calm her. But she insisted
that her experience was real; that she bore an important message to me
from some invisible individual. Such nonsense increased my irritation.
But—after about an hour of it—my jaw fell with astonishment. I became
suddenly aware of a coherence in her ravings, and further that they were
couched in my own language of symbols. My attention being thus awakened,
I listened to what she was saying. A few minutes convinced me that she
was actually in communication with some Intelligence who had a message
for me.<br />
Let me briefly explain the grounds for this belief. I have already set
forth, in connection with the Cairo Working, some of the safeguards
which I habitually employ. Virakam’s vision contained elements perfectly
familiar to me. This was clear proof that the man in her vision, whom
she called Ab-ul-Diz, was acquainted with my system of hieroglyphics,
literal and numerical, and also with some incidents in my Magical
Career. Virakam herself certainly knew nothing of any of these.
Ab-ul-Diz told us to call him a week later, when he would give further
information. We arrived at St. Moritz and engaged a suite in the Palace
Hotel.<br />
My first surprise was to find that I had brought with me exactly those
Magical Weapons which were suitable for the work proposed, and no
others. But a yet more startling circumstance was to come.<br />
For the purpose of the Cairo Working, Ouarda8 and I had bought two
abbai; one, scarlet, for me; one, blue, for her. I had brought mine to
St. Moritz; the other was of course in the possession of Ouarda.<br />
Imagine my amazement when Virakam produced from her trunk a blue abbai
so like Ouarda’s that the only difference were minute details of the
gold embroidery! The suggestion was that the Secret Chiefs, having
chosen Ouarda as their messenger, could not use any one else until she
had become irrevocably disqualified by insanity. Not till now could her
place be taken by another; and that Virakam should possess a duplicate
of her Magical Robe seemed a strong argument that she had been
consecrated by Them to take the place of her unhappy predecessor.<br />
She was very unsatisfactory as a clairvoyant; she resented these
precautions. She was a quicktempered and impulsive woman, always eager
to act with reckless enthusiasm. My cold scepticism no doubt prevented
her from doing her best. Ab-ul-Diz himself constantly demanded that I
should show “faith,” and warned me that I was wrecking my chances by my
attitude. I prevailed upon him, however, to give adequate proof of his
existence, and his claim to speak with authority. The main purport of
his message was to instruct me to write a book on my system of Mysticism
and Magick, to be called Book 4, and told me that by means of this book,
I should prevail against public neglect. I saw no objection to writing
such a book; on quite rational grounds, it was a proper course of
action. I therefore agreed to do so. But Ab-ul-Diz was determined to
dictate the conditions in which the book should be written; and this was
a difficult matter. He wanted us to travel to an appropriate place. On
this point I was not wholly satisfied with the result of my
cross-examination. I know now that I was much to blame throughout. I was
not honest either with him, myself, or Virakam. I allowed material
considerations to influence me, and I clung—oh triple fool!—to my
sentimental obligations towards Laylah.9<br />
We finally decided to do what he asked, though part of my objection was
founded on his refusal to give us absolutely definite instruction.
However, we crossed the Passes in a sleigh to Chiavenna, whence we took
the train to Milan. In this city we had a final conversation with
Ab-ul-Diz. I had exhausted his patience, as he mine, and he told us that
he would not visit us any more. He gave us his final instructions. We
were to go to Rome, though he refused to name the exact spot. We were to
take a villa and there write Book 4. I asked him how we might recognise
the right Villa. I forget what answer he gave through her, but for the
first time he flashed a message directly into my own consciousness. “You
will recognise it beyond the possibility of doubt or error,” he told me.
With this a picture came into my mind of a hillside on which were a
house and garden marked by two tall Persian Nuts.<br />
The next day we went on to Rome. Owing to my own Ananias-like attempt to
“keep back part of the price,” my relations with Virakam had become
strained. We reached Naples after two or three quarrelsome days in Rome
and began house-hunting. I imagined that we should find dozens of
suitable places to choose from, but we spent day after day scouring the
city and suburbs in an automobile, without finding a single place to let
that corresponded in the smallest degree with our ideas.<br />
Virakam’s brat—a most god-forsaken lout—was to join us for the Christmas
holidays, and on the day he was due to arrive we motored out as a
forlorn hope to Posilippo before meeting him at the station at 4 o’clock
or thereabouts. But the previous night Virakam had a dream in which she
saw the desired villa with absolute clearness. (I had been careful to
say nothing to her about the Persian Nuts, so as to have a weapon
against her in case she insisted that such and such a place was the one
intended.)<br />
After a fruitless search we turned our automobile towards Naples, along
the crest of Posilippo. At one point there is a small side lane scarcely
negotiable by motor, and indeed hardly perceptible, as it branches from
the main road so as to form an acute-angled “Y” with the foot towards
Naples. But<br />
Virakam sprang excitedly to her feet, and told the chauffeur to drive
down it. I was astonished, she being hysterically anxious to meet the
train, and our time being already almost too short. But she swore
passionately that the villa was down that lane. The road became
constantly rougher and narrower. After some time, it came out on the
open slope; a low stone parapet of the left protecting it. Again she
sprang to her feet. “There,” she cried, pointing with her finger, “is
the Villa I saw in my dream!” I looked. No villa was visible. I said so.
She had to agree; yet stuck to her point that she saw it. I subsequently
returned to that spot and found that a short section of wall, perhaps 15
feet of narrow edge of masonry, is just perceptible through a gap in the
vegetation.<br />
We drove on; we came to a tiny piazza, on one side of which was a
church. “That is the square and the Church,” she exclaimed, “that I saw
in my dream!” We drove on. The lane became narrower, rougher and
steeper. Little more than 100 yards ahead it was completely “up,”
blocked with heaps of broken stone. The chauffeur protested that he
would be able neither to turn the car nor to back it up to the square.
Virakam, in a violent rage, insisted on proceeding. I shrugged my
shoulders. I had got accustomed to these typhoons.<br />
We drove on a few yards. Then the chauffeur made up him mind to revolt,
and stopped the car. On the left was a wide open gate through which we
could see a gang of workmen engaged in pretending to repair a ramshackle
villa. Virakam called the foreman and asked in broken Italian if the
place was to let. He told her no; it was under repair. With crazy
confidence she dragged him within and forced him to show her over the
house. I sat in resigned disgust, not deigning to follow. Then my eyes
suddenly saw down the garden, two trees close together. I stooped. Their
tops appeared. They were Persian Nuts! The stupid coincidence angered
me, and yet some irresistible instinct compelled me to take out my note
book and pencil and jot down the name written over the gate—Villa
Caldarazzo. Idly I added up the letters.10 Their sum struck me like a
bullet in my brain. It was 418, the number of the Magical Formula of the
Aeon, a numerical hieroglyph of the Great Work. Ab-ul-Diz had made no
mistake. My recognition of the right place was not to depend on a mere
matter of trees, which might be found almost anywhere. Recognition
beyond all possibility of doubt was what he promised. He had been as
good as his word.<br />
I was entirely overwhelmed. I jumped out of the car and ran up to the
house. I found Virakam in the main room. The instant I entered I
understood that it was entirely suited for a temple. The walls were
decorated with crude frescoes which somehow suggested the exact
atmosphere proper to the Work. The very shape of the room seemed somehow
significant. Further, it seemed as if it were filled with a peculiar
emanation. This impression must not be dismissed as sheer fancy. Few men
but are sufficiently sensitive to distinguish the spiritual aura of
certain buildings. It is impossible not to feel reverence in certain
cathedrals and temples. The most ordinary dwelling houses often possess
an atmosphere of their own; some depress, some cheer; some disgust,
others strike chill to the heart.<br />
Virakam of course was entirely certain that this was the Villa for us.
Against this was the positive statement of the people in charge that it
was not to be let. We refused to accept this assertion. We took the name
and address of the owner, dug him out, and found him willing to give us
immediate possession at a small rent. We went in on the following day,
and settled down almost at once to consecrate the Temple and begin the
book.</p>

<p>666</p>
<p>[The following is from The Confessions, Vol. 4, pp. 379 – 384.11]</p>
<p>I knew in myself from the first that the revelation in Cairo was the
real thing. I have proved with infinite pains that this was the case;
yet the proof has not strengthened my faith, and disproof would do
nothing to shake it. I knew in myself that the Secret Chiefs had
arranged that the manuscript of The Book of the Law should have been
hidden under the Watch Towers and the Watch Towers under the ski; that
they had driven me to make the key to my position the absence of the
manuscript; that they had directed Kenneth Ward’s actions for years that
he might be the means of the discovery, and arranged every detail of the
incident in such a way that I should understand it as I did.<br />
Yes; this involves a theory of the powers of the Secret Chiefs so
romantic and unreasonable that it seems hardly worth a smile of
contempt. As it happens, an almost parallel phenomenon came to pass ten
years later. I propose to quote it here in order to show that the most
ordinary events, apparently disconnected, are in fact only intelligible
by postulating some such people as the Secret Chiefs of the A.’.A.’. in
possession of some such prevision and power as I ascribe to them. When I
returned to England at Christmas, 1919, all my plans had gone to pieces
owing to the dishonesty and treachery of a gang which was bullying into
insanity my publisher in Detroit. I was pledged in honour to look after
a certain person; but I was practically penniless. I could not see any
possible way of carrying on my work. (It will be related in due course
how this condition of things came about, and why it was necessary for me
to undergo it.) I found myself at Morêt, on the edge of the Forest of
Fontainebleau, with nothing to do but wait. I did not throw up the
sponge in passionate despair as I had done once before to my shame—I had
been rapped sufficiently hard on the knuckles to cure me of that—but I
said to the Gods “Observe, I have done my damnedest, and here I am at a
dead centre. I am not going on muddling through: I demand a definite
sign from you that I am still your chosen prophet.” I therefore note in
my diary, on January 12, 1920, as follows:<br />
I am inclined to make my Silence include all forms of personal work, and
this is very hard to give up, if only because I am still afraid of
‘failure,’ which is absurd. I ought evidently to be non-attached, even
to avoiding the Woes-Attendant-Upon-Refusing-The-Curse-Of-My-Grade, if I
may be pardoned the expression.<br />
And why should I leave my efficacious Tortoise and look at people till
my lower jaw hangs down?<br />
Shall I see what the Yi says? Ay. Question: Shall I abandon all magical
work soever until the appearance of a manifest sign?<br />
Answer:<br />
No symbol could be more definite and unambiguous.<br />
I have invoked Aiwass to manipulate the Sticks; and, wishing to ask
“What shall be the Sign?” got instantly the reference in CCXX to our
Lady Babalon: “the omnipresence of my body.” But this is not quite
clear; I took it mentally as referring to the expected arrival of Our
Lady, but it might mean a trance, or almost anything. So I will ask Yi,
as my last magical act for the time being. I think this means the
arrival of Our Lady. I have serious doubts whether the hexagram should
not have been:<br />
Which would have certainly meant that. That I should doubt anything is
absurd: I shall know the Sign, without fail. And herewith I close the
Record, and await that Sign.<br />
The next entry is dated Sunday, February 1.<br />
Kindly read over the entry of January 12 with care exceeding. Now then:
On Friday, January 30, I went to Paris, to buy pencils, Mandarin, a
palette, Napoleon Brandy, canvases and other appurtenances of the
artist’s dismal trade. I took occasion to call upon an old mistress of
mine, Jane Chéron, concerning who see Equinox Vol. I, “Three Poems.” She
has never had the slightest interest in occult matters, and she has
never done any work in her life, even of the needlework order. I had
seen her once before since my escape from America, and she said she had
something to show me, but I took no particular notice, and she did not
insist. My object in calling on this second occasion was multiple: I
wanted to see the man with whom she is living, who has not yet returned
from Russia; I wanted to make love to her; and wanted to smoke a few
pipes of opium with her, she being a devotee of that great and terrible
God.<br />
Consider now: the Work whereby I am a Magus began in Cairo (1904) with
the discovery of the Stèle of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, in which the principal
object is the Body of our Lady Nuit. It is reproduced in colours in the
Equinox, Vol. I, No. 7. Jane Chéron has a copy of this book. On Friday
afternoon, then, I was in her apartment. I had attained none of my
objectives in calling on her, and was about to depart. She detained me
to show me this “something.” She went and took a folded cloth from a
drawer. “Shut your eyes,” she said.<br />
When I opened them they saw a cloth four feet or more in length, on
which was a magnificent copy, mostly in applique silk, of the Stèle. She
then told me that in February 1917, she and her young man had gone to
the South of France to get cured of the opium habit. In such cases
insomnia is frequent.<br />
One night, however, he had gone to sleep, and on waking in the morning
found that she, wakeful, had drawn a copy of the Stèle on a great sheet
of paper.<br />
It is very remarkable that so large a sheet of paper should have been at
hand; also that they should have taken that special book on such a
journey; but still more that she should have chosen that picture, nay
that she, who had never done anything of the sort before, should have
done it at all.<br />
More yet, that she should have spent three months in making a permanent
thing of it. Most of all, that she should have shown it to me at the
very moment when I was awaiting an “unmistakable” sign.<br />
For observe, how closely the Words of my Entry of January 12 describe
the sign, “the omnipresence of my body.” And there She was—in the last
place in the world where one would have sought Her.<br />
Note, too, the accuracy of the Yi King symbol for the Stèle is of course
the Symbol of our Lady, and the God below Her in the Sun.<br />
All this is clear proof of the unspeakable power and wisdom of Those who
have sent me to proclaim the Law.<br />
I observe, after a talk with M. Jules Courtier yesterday, that all their
S.P.R. work is proof only of extra-human Forces. We knew about them all
along; the universe is full of obscure and subtle manifestation of
energy; we are constantly advancing in our knowledge and control of
them.<br />
Telekinesis is of the same order of Nature as the Hertz Rays or the
Radium emanations. But what nobody before me has done is to prove the
existence of extra-human Intelligence, and my magical Record does this.
I err in the interpretation, of course; but it is impossible to doubt
that there is a Somebody there, a Somebody capable of combining events
as a Napoleon forms his plans of campaign, and possessed of powers
unthinkably vast.<br />
If these events be indeed the result of calculation and control on the
part of the Secret Chiefs, it seems at first sight as if the people
involved had been prepared to play their parts from the beginning.<br />
Our previous relations, the girl’s to opium, my friendship with her
lover, and his interest in my work; omit any item and the whole plan
fails. But this assumption is unnecessary. The actual preparation need
not go back further than three years, when the Stèle was embroidered. We
may allow the Secret Chiefs considerable option, just as a chess player
is not confined to one special combination for his attack. We may
suppose that had these people not been available, the sign which I
demanded might have been given me in some other equally striking
way.<br />
We are not obliged to make extravagant assumptions in order to maintain
that the evidence of purpose is irresistibly strong.<br />
To dismiss this intricate concatenation of circumstances, culminating as
they do in the showing forth of the exact sign which I had demanded, is
simply to strain the theory of probabilities beyond the breaking point.
Here then are two complicated episodes which do to prove that I am
walking, not by faith but by sight, in my relations with the Secret
Chiefs; and these are but two links in a very long chain. This account
of my career will describe many others equally striking. I might,
perhaps, deny my inmost instinct the right to testify were any one case
of this kind in question; but when, year after year, the same sort of
thing keeps on happening, and, when, furthermore, I find myself able to
predict, as experience has taught me to do in the last three years, that
they will happen, and even how the pieces will fit into the puzzle, I am
justified in assuming a causal connection.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-lii-family-public-enemy-no.-1">Chapter LII: Family:
Public Enemy No. 1</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>In your last letter you mention “family pressure.” Horrid word,
family! Its very etymology accuses it of servility and stagnation.<br />
Latin, famulus, a servant; Oscan, Faamat, he dwells.<br />
It almost deserves the treatment it gets in that disreputable
near-Limerick:</p>
<p>Three was a young lady named Emily<br />
Who was not understood by her femily,<br />
She acted so rummily,<br />
The head of the fummily,<br />
Had her matched with a greyhound from Wem-b-iley.<br />
They feared she would breed a facsimile—<br />
Bring utter disgrace on the fimilly,<br />
So the head of the fommily,<br />
Read her a homily—<br />
And the devil flew out of the Chim-b-illy!<br />
A word ought to have more respect for itself!</p>
<p>Then, think what horrid images it evokes from the mind. Not only
Victorian; wherever the family has been strong, it has always been an
engine of tyranny. Weak members or weak neighbours: it is the mob spirit
crushing genius, or overwhelming opposition by brute arithmetic. Of
course, one must be of good family to do anything much that is worth
doing; but what is one to say when the question of the Great Work is
posed?<br />
Bless you, the whole strength of the family is based on the fact that it
cares for the family only: therefore its magical formula thus
concentrated is of necessity hostile to so exclusively individual an aim
as Initiation.<br />
Its sentiments are reciprocated.<br />
In every Magical, or similar system, it is invariably the first
condition which the Aspirant must fulfil: he must once and for all and
for ever put his family outside his magical circle.<br />
Even the Gospels insist clearly and weightily on this.<br />
Christ himself (i.e. whoever is meant by this name in this passage)
callously disowns his mother and his brethren (Luke VIII, 19). And he
repeatedly makes discipleship contingent on the total renunciation of
all family ties. He would not even allow a man to attend his father’s
funeral!<br />
Is the magical tradition less rigid?<br />
Not on your life!<br />
The one serious grimoire of the Middle Ages is The Book of the Sacred
Magic of Abramelin the Mage.<br />
He makes no bone about it. He even condescends to point out the family
as the most serious of all the obstacles to the performance of the
Operation, and he gives the correct psychological reasons why this
should be so. You said it yourself! “Family pressure” was your pungent
and pertinent expression. Just so.<br />
I think that “family” should include any body of persons with common
interests which they expect or wish you to share. One’s old school or
university, the regiment, the golf club, the business, the party, the
country: any of these may dislike very much your absorption in affairs
alien to their own. But the family is the classic type, because its pull
is so potent and persistent. It began when you gave your first yell;
your personality is deliberately wrenched and distorted to the family
code; and their zoology is so inadequate that they always feel sure that
their Ugly Duckling is a Black Sheep. Even for their Fool they find a
use: he can be invaluable in the Church of in the Army, where docile
incompetence is the sure key to advancement.<br />
Curse them! They are always in the way.<br />
Even centuries after one of them is dead, he exercises his abominable
craft; and you are only the less able to ward off the slaps of the Dead
Hand, because (after all!) there is a whole lot of him in you.<br />
He appears at times as a sort of alien conscience; and, indebted as you
may be to him for your physical constitution—I give him credit for not
having saddled you with gout, rheumatism, T.B., or other plague—and many
of your most useful virtues, you want to handle your assets yourself,
without a subterranean current of criticism, or even active interference
through others in your sole preoccupation in the Great Work.<br />
I have not actually detected any ancestor of mine stealing my whiskey,
as the advertisement warns us may happen: but—oh well! However you like
to look at it, he is always an influence upon you; and that, good or
bad, you quite rightly resent.<br />
In the Brahmin caste, the aspirant to Yoga makes it a rule to fulfil his
duties to the family and the State; once those jobs are definitely done,
he cuts the painter, and becomes Sannyasi. Many a Maharajah, many a
Wazir, to say nothing of less responsible people, plan their lives from
their earliest days of wearing the sacred Cord as Brahmacharyi, with
these ambitions carefully mapped out; and when the right moment comes
for him to disappear into the jungle—the rest is Silence.<br />
A sound scheme: that is, provided that one has full confidence in the
General Theory. But we Caucasians happen not to believe in the Vedas, at
least not in the dyed-in-the-wool sense which comes natural to the
budding Brahmin; as to “our own”—why our own?—scriptures, no intelligent
person takes them seriously any more. Some folk whittle away merrily,
and fashion a Saviour in their own images; others strain the text and
concoct a symbolic interpretation which is more or less satisfying—as
can be done with any bunch of legends. But such devices leave us without
Accepted Authority, and without that nobody is going to gamble away his
life. Thus the Path for men of spiritual integrity begins with absolute
scepticism. Our methods must be exclusively inductive.<br />
“Gamble away his life,” did I say? Indeed I did. If there is any truth
at all in anything, or even any meaning in life, in Nature herself; then
there is one thing, one thing only paramount: to find out who one is,
what is one’s necessary Way.<br />
The alternative to the Great Work is the hotchpot of dispersion, of
fatuity, or disconnected nonsense.<br />
To the performance of this Work the nearest obstacle and the most
obvious is the Family. Its presumption is manifest, in that it expects
everybody to yield it first priority.<br />
In the Russian troubles following the October Revolution, General
Denikin, who was trying to put Humpty-Dumpty back on the wall, captured
the aged parents of Leon Trotsky, in command of the enemy, and
chivalrously telegraphed him to withdraw his troops to certain
positions, otherwise the old people would be shot. Trotsky replied
“Shoot!”<br />
The point of this story is that I hope it will answer your next
question: You are so very clear and firm about the family; then why
don’t you insist on all your pupils starting with a domestic
holocaust?<br />
Why? Because a lot of my early rock climbing was done on Beachy Head.
Ask me something harder!<br />
Look you now, chalk has every possible element of danger from the
standpoint of the cragsman. All the more glory to him who can master
it!<br />
It is an essential part of the Rosicrucian system that the Adept should
“wear the costume of the country in which he is travelling.” I take this
in the widest sense. By that word “country” I understand this planet and
this social status “to which it has pleased God to call me.” The
Brethren of the Rose and Cross depreciated monastic life or hermit life:
perhaps they thought such expedients cowardly, or at least as a
confession of weakness.<br />
I agree. One ought to be able to live the normal life of a member of
one’s class, to all external seeming; at least sufficiently so as not to
appear unduly eccentric.<br />
Perhaps “Let my servants be few &amp; secret: …” bears some such
implication.<br />
But the condition of allowing such apparent laxity is this: That one
should be as swift and terse as Trotsky in any similar situation.<br />
If one’s family were reasonable human beings, (But they never are, she
sighed) one could perhaps do wiseliest by explaining the situation.
“This Work of mine—you don’t understand it, no need that you should—is
the only important part of my life. I mean to be scrupulously careful of
your feelings, and I see no reason why my chosen career should damage
our relations. There is only one thing to remember: IF I ever get the
faintest suspicion that you are opposing me, or condemning my plans, or
interfering in any way, even with the best intentions, THEN—with a
single blow I sever our relations, and for ever.” “Well, that’s really
very nice of you, Holy One,” you might say; “but you are not the only
one to be considered, what about the Masters? Do they ride us on the
snaffle? Tradition says not so.”<br />
This depends wholly on you. If you are a quite ordinary Aspirant, and a
few dozen incarnations one way or the other don’t make such a
difference, then They presumably won’t bother about you at all.<br />
In the course of centuries, Karma will roll out the creases.<br />
But—suppose you are of those specially chosen to execute some necessary
operation in the course of Their plans? Quite another pair of boots to
tread that Path. Don’t imagine that you are not on it yet, either, just
because you happen to be in a mood of humility. A pawn may be more
powerful than a Rook, in some positions.<br />
However, even if you are not on it, you can start to-day. That is one of
the matters that depends exclusively on you.<br />
If you have already taken the appropriate and adequate Oath, well and
good; if not, take it now!<br />
What Oath?<br />
To cross the Abyss, you have to give up “all that you have and all that
you are.” This Oath is unconditional: see The Vision and the Voice for
details.<br />
But for the present so much is neither desirable nor possible: in fact,
you cannot genuinely realise what it means.<br />
So you may content yourself with a simple, reasonable and intelligible
Oath for the present: to devote “all that you have and all that you are”
to the service of the Order.<br />
The advantage of so doing is that the Grand Auditor of the City of the
Pyramids takes immediate notice. He brings your account (Karma) up to
date, and starts you off with a Cash Ledger. That is, he arranges for
your errors to be paid for on the spot, instead of the customary credit
system that goes on for centuries. The advantage of this is that you
know what you are being punished for, and learn your lesson at
once.<br />
This process is, naturally, very painful at times; for one thing, you
can’t dope yourself with illusions about your being a grand-souled,
great-hearted, misunderstood saint, martyr, and hero.<br />
And—this I tell you from most bitter experience—the agony is sometimes
all but unendurable. The Masters (or the Lords of Karma, or whatever you
like: I have to put all this in a silly romantic language, if I am to
get the meaning across at all) see the position with absolute accuracy;
They know at once how so-and-so, which you made rather a point of
offering, is really that which you feel you can bear to surrender.
Believe me, it is a very thorough winnowing, “with which he shall
thoroughly purge his floor,” when Vannus Iacchi whirs in the mill.<br />
My personal attitude to all this is, it may be, unduly positive. I may
be a bit of a fanatic. But I’m inclined to think that you will feel the
same, because of your detestation of the “elusive.” Having decided to
gamble, there is no sense in fumbling with the dice. Anything that makes
for closer contact, prompter action, clearer vision, is to be
welcome.<br />
The deliberate swearing of such Oaths, and the passionate adherence to
them, is the surest method of approach to the Masters. You force the
gate of Their temple; if not actually one of Them, you are at least in
Their class.<br />
Only one reminder: it is worse than useless to take these Oaths with any
such ambition. One of the most precious privileges thus gained is the
clean sweep that is made of all pretence.<br />
This too is painful beyond words at first. Until the process starts, you
have not the faintest idea of how you have wrapped yourself in layers of
lies.<br />
(The Baltis are like this, you know; they wrap the baby when it is born,
and add rag after rag, never removing any, until a prosperous citizen at
40 is more like a bale of cloth than a human being!) May I add that you
are going to be shocked? Ideas of the most atrocious and abominable
nastiness, things literally unthinkable by your normal conscious
apparatus, are discovered as the mainsprings of your character!<br />
Those in attendance at confinements are always at first amazed and
horrified by the remarks of the most virtuous and refined ladies; but
that is the mere loosening of a few superficial layers, such as are
accessible to anaesthetics. These revelations amount to not 1/10 of 1%
of the grisly horrors that are revealed by Sammasati.<br />
Now go ahead!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-liii-mother-love">Chapter LIII: “Mother-Love”</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You enthusiastically remark that the love of the mother for the
off-spring is something that no man can understand: and you appear to
prize it!<br />
Well, some men have had a jolly good shot at it, notably Emile Zola. The
Usher goes into the corridor, and calls that name in strident and
stentorian tones. In he waddles, the squat obese bespectacled studious
Jew, with the most devastating of all his thunderbolts under his arm—La
Terre, and so what?</p>
<p>“How he will prologuize, how he will perorate” about:<br />
“The dewy musk-rose, mid-May’s eldest child,<br />
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves!”<br />
He will not.<br />
La Terre to him is indeed the mother of all men, sole source of our
essential nourishment, the earth to which we are all bound in chains by
our inexorable bodies, our ineluctable need of life—and death.<br />
Sublime the thesis? What does he make of it? Theme No. 1 in the first
chapter: rural love. How exquisite, how delicate, first flush of dawn
upon the glowing meadows! The young man who is courting is not idle,
either; he serves great nature in yet other ways. He is taking a prize
cow to be “served:” on him depend our milk, cheese, butter, veal and
beef. He also contributes to our Wienerschnitzel Holstein, or Filet de
Boeuf à la Robespierre, our Sole au Gratin and our oeufs à la
Neige.<br />
So then, our rustic idyll! “Rocked on the bosom of our Mother Nature.”
Longus paints Daphnis and Chloe, Whowasit draws “Aucassin and
Nicolette”—why, it’s a root of literature itself all the way to Austin
Dobson, Norman Gale and Thomas Hardy, Theocritus—er—hum—not so much of
“Mother-love” Trinacria way!<br />
Where Zola failed, who can hope to succeed? To distinguish between brute
and brute: no, dear lady, that task I not regretfully relinquish!<br />
But in “refined” strata? That cock won’t fight, O thou Aspirant to the
Sacred Wisdom! It’s very often worse; for under the anaesthetic, the
most delicately-minded ladies of high social position and religious
repute are apt to pour forth floods of filth which would disgust the
coarsest harridans of slum-land!<br />
This is the final fact: so long as our life is bound to that of the
animal and vegetable worlds, so that we are bondslaves born to their
quite ineradicable habits, so long are we dragged back from every flight
of fancy or imagination such as would break the chains that anchor us to
mud.<br />
The most far-seeing of our prophetically minded writers, Aldous Huxley,
brands this black fact upon our foreheads.<br />
The first condition of a “Brave New World” must be the dissociation of
sexual from reproductive life.1<br />
The word “mother” must be as nauseating to all properly human minds as
it now is to everyone that has contemplated the subject with clear
vision.<br />
I know there is an answer to all this; in fact, The Book of the Law
enables us to take it in our stride.<br />
But there is another aspect of “mother-love” which is urgent, practical,
and in no way dependent upon ideal considerations.<br />
What do we find in practice as the immediate consequence of this
“sublime,” this “holy” instinct?<br />
Quite a few species of animals habitually devour their offspring; but
women “know a trick worth two of that.”<br />
No, no, let Zola rhapsodise!<br />
Time passes. Libitina smiles. But the conditions are not spacious; both
the “happy events”—real ladies and gentlemen emphasize this euphemism
with a snigger and a smirk—are expected the same night, and the only
place available is the barn.<br />
Now Zola, well into his stride, gives us full details, hopping from one
corner of the barn to the other, so accurately and so judicially that
the reader very soon “loses his place,” and doesn’t know which birth is
being described in any given paragraph.<br />
The accumulated hogwash of a billion sentimentalists dashes in vain
against that cliff of ugly truth.<br />
Next witness: Dr Doughty, who looked after the health of Trinity
College, Cambridge.<br />
A swift routine examination: then he tilted his chair backwards, thrust
his hands deep into his trousers pockets, fixed the patient with a glare
of ice; then these words dropped like vitriol from his lips:
You—young—fool! You go and put the most tender part of your body where I
wouldn’t put my umbrella!”<br />
It is the magical formula of a man to push outwards, of a woman to close
upon from without.<br />
This is commonly seen as the possessive instinct: it may often be masked
as “protective” but its essential truth is the impulse to devour. Hence
the death-like idea of “home,” where she can digest her victims in
security and at leisure.<br />
Hence, as even Jung saw in his very first book, and wrote in stated
terms, the first task of manhood—of the “hero”—is to escape from the
mother. Now the son, with his male formula, his formula of life, his
instinct to push out, to break down all that would restrain him, finds
it perfectly natural to “bite the hand that fed him,” as the complaint
might piteously wail. But the daughter has no club to smash, no sword to
cut; all she can hope to do is to pass the buck. The amoeba, born of
fusion,2 nourished by wrapping its pseudopods around such drifting
particles as come within its scope, is but a parasite on its own dam
until the fusion is complete.<br />
So, when a woman is “so good,” “so devoted to her daughter,” God help
the daughter!<br />
She is never allowed to think for herself in the minutest matters; she
is bound hand and foot remorselessly to the routine of her “decent
Christian home;” a wageless kitchen-slut. No hope of escape unless the
mother’s vampirism takes the form of selling her off to the highest
bidder.<br />
Need it be added that the “good mother” is usually quite unaware of all
this, will read these simple statements of plain fact in speechless
rage?<br />
But the truth stands: the woman-formula is Death: “return to the Great
Mother” is the catastrophe of the hero, whether he be Coriolanus or Peer
Gynt.<br />
It is surely unnecessary to state the rider to this theorem; so perhaps
I had better:<br />
Anyone who has not totally and for ever destroyed in himself every
vestige of this instinct, extirpating every root and charring it with
Fire, cannot take the first step on the Path of the Wise.<br />
How nobly opposite is the Man-Formula! Its freight the wealth of the
whole Universe, that splendid Argosy leaps free upon the glittering
Ocean, to cast the very Soul of Life upon uncharted and enchanted
isles!<br />
It is not to these few but well-chosen words that I propose to look to
enhance my popularity in the Woman’s Clubs of the United States.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. “Mother-Love” is, of course, a branch of family affection about
which I have already written to you in no uncertain terms. Of all its
sub-sections this is the worst because it is the strongest, the most
natural, that is to say, the most brutish. You have complained
pathetically on more than one occasion that I do not seem to know my own
mind about Nature; that I am always contradicting myself. Sometimes I
tell you that everything is in Nature; that everything moves by Nature:
that to oppose Nature is to provoke endothermic reaction, and then I
leap headlong through the hoop of my own construction and want you to
defy nature, to attack her, to overcome her. Really, dear Master, it is
too bad of you! I know it sounds bad but there is not really the
opposition that on the surface there seems to be. Perhaps it is that we
are talking about two kinds of Nature. In one sense it might be asserted
that the final formula of Nature is Inertia; in other words, that the
dyad of manifested existence is an arbitrary and artificial development
of the Zero to which everything must always cancel out.<br />
Now by saying that, we have to all intents and purposes, answered the
question which it poses; all positive development must be a conflict
with that Inertia. It is the opposition between the magical Path and the
Mystical; we may therefore say fearlessly that all forms of progress,
although they make use of the formulae of nature which have brought them
to their present situation, are attempts to proceed further on the way
of the True Will.<br />
It is particularly important to understand this at the present time when
the Aeon of Horus is just getting under way. For the Aeon of Isis, that
of the Mother, appears to have regarded the whole of Nature as a
spontaneous growth of universal scope. In the Aeon Of Osiris, the
restriction of Family appears for the first time.<br />
The world of sentient beings is separated into clusters, each family,
clan, gens, or nation, acting as a unit and standing upon armed
neutrality with respect to similar groups. But in the Aeon of Horus this
system has broken down. That such is the case is already abundantly
manifest.<br />
Totalitarianism in any of its forms tends to break down the family
structure. It considers only the Individual, and him, merely as a unit
in the welter of the state.<br />
Experience will doubtless prove that this idea simply will not work. The
Individual will come to his own, but it will be impossible to
reconstruct the Family System.<br />
It will in particular be impossible to maintain the intimate relation
between Mother and Child, which has been so dominant a feature of past
civilizations.<br />
The very social and economic causes which in the old time tended to
cement the relationship, have become centrifugal in their effect.</p>
<p>1: It is by no means clear that Huxley saw the kind of society he
described in Brave New World as particularly desirable; and it is odd
that Crowley, given his scathing remarks on the subject of Utopias
constructed on a priori grounds (vide chapter 79, “Progress” should seem
to endorse such things. In the “New Comment” on AL I, 40 Crowley
similarly quotes, apparently favourably (in connection with the “Three
Grades”) a proposal for a “Rational State” outlined by a character in an
earlier Huxley novel, Chrome Yellow (the scheme in question was in any
case straight out of Plato’s Republic); and yet in any such regulated
society, “Irregularity, Eccentricity, Disorder, the Revolutionary
Spirit, Experiment” are precisely those qualities which are stamped on,
and hard – T.S.<br />
2: sic, s.b. “fission” – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-liv-on-meanness">Chapter LIV: “On Meanness”</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed! As you surmise, the injunction to “buy the egg of a
perfectly black hen without haggling” is another way of putting the
Parable of the Pearl of Great Price; a much better way. For the
Pearlbuyer did think of equating the values, which is precisely what one
must not do. That Egg is incommensurable with money.<br />
(Further, the saying teaches one to insist on perfection; the hen must
not have one tinge of aught but black in any feather.)<br />
However, that is neither here nor there; what you want me to do is to
discuss Economy in its magical aspects.<br />
Very good: to begin, Economy does not mean thrift or cheeseparing. It
means: the law of the house.<br />
In practice, one may say “management.” Finances are only one branch of
the science, just as truckling, blackmail, graft, treachery and
double-dealing are only components of modern statesmanship.<br />
All the same, I propose to talk in terms of money, because everyone has
thought a good deal about it. Examples are abundant, ideas easy to
express, and one can be concise and clear without danger of
misunderstanding.<br />
So let us call this letter Moralising on Meanness!<br />
Firstly (dearly beloved brethren) meanness is flat contradiction to the
Teaching of The Book of the Law. For “The word of Sin is Restriction….”
and meanness is plainly a most flagrant case of Restriction. Also, there
is nearly always an element of Fear in meanness; at least, I would like
to bet that 95% of mean people originally became so because they foresaw
a friendless and penniless old age. And fear is particularly forbidden
in the Book: II, 16 “…fear not to undergo the curses….”<br />
Waxing in wrath, III, 17 goes on: “…Fear not at all; fear neither men
nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything. Money fear not, nor laughter of the
folk folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth or under the
earth….” Then pretty well all the positive injunctions imply reckless
enthusiasm.<br />
“Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and
fire, are of us.” (AL II,20)<br />
What’s more, meanness does not even pay! I propose to tell you why this
is, and how things work out.<br />
What is money? A medium of exchange devised to facilitate the
transaction of business. Oil in the engine. Very good, then; if instead
of letting it flow as freely and smoothly as possible, you baulk its
very nature; you prevent it from doing its True Will. So every
restriction (that word again!) on the exchange of wealth is a direct
violation of the Law of Thelema.<br />
How stupid is this tightening of the purse-strings! Parable No. Three,
“The fairy Bank Note.”<br />
One evening a man walked into an inn and asked for hospitality. In the
morning, when his bill came, he found he had nothing but a £100 note.
“I’m afraid I’ve no change till the Banks open.” “Oh, stick to it— I’ll
be back next week—I’ve enough petrol to take me home.”<br />
“Handy,” thought Boniface, “that will just square my brewer.” That
reminded the brewer to pay his corn chandler, who had been worrying him
to settle. He wasn’t nasty about it; he really needed the money for his
farmer, a worthy man who wanted to build some new outhouses, and the
builder couldn’t give any credit because he was being pressed by the man
who supplied his materials, a man in great trouble on account of his
wife’s long illness, and the necessity of an immediate and very
expensive operation.<br />
So the doctor went round, very lordly, to the local estate agent, and
made the first payment on the new house he had wanted for so long.
“Hullo! Hullo!” laughed the agent; “here we are again. It’s curious, but
I paid out that note only ten days ago!”<br />
So there were seven hampered and worried men all made happy, and the
Bank note was in the hands of its original holder.<br />
Now then for True Story No. 1. It is my own experience. When, nearly 40
years ago, I walked through Spain, accompanied only by a single chela,
there was little paper money in use, at least in the rather primitive
places which we favoured. The currency was confined to the silver peso,
and its fractions. About 90 miles north of Madrid, we found, one fine
morning, that our well-meant attempt to pay our bill at the posada threw
a bombshell into the works: the people of the Inn jabbered and
gesticulated among themselves for about half an hour before they
produced our receipt, and bade us Hasta la vista!<br />
Next day, the same thing, rather worse. The day after, worse still; and
we saw that they were disputing about the coins that we had handed over.
Finally, about 20 miles from Madrid, they wouldn’t take our money at
all! Instead, they pointed out that we were English gentlemen, and they
would be eternally honoured and grateful if we would send the money from
Madrid!<br />
On arrival at that city, we noticed long queues of people besieging the
Banks; I put my finger to my nose, and said Aha!<br />
But, sitting down at a café, oh no! not at all! Pesos were passing
without question. Well, well! So I got into conversation with a
knowledgeable-looking bloke, and he told me the whole story. It seemed
that the Director of Customs had a brother in Mexico D.F. who
manufactured brass bedsteads. The uprights of these were packed with
forged pesos of Fernando VII and one other king—I forget his name—made
of the same standard silver alloy as the genuine coins, and so well
executed that the only way to tell the false was that they looked newer
than they should have been, in view of the date!<br />
And so (continued my informant) there was a panic, and no one would take
any money at all, and the city was dying on its feet! So the Government
gave orders to the Banks to change any coins soever for their equivalent
in freshly-minted money—that’s what those queues are—and “everyone is
happy again.” “But,” I objected, “I see you have some old coins.” He
laughed. “Those one-eyed mules at the Banks! All foolishness! Days ago
we all agreed to take any money without question—and as long as we all
do that, why, nobody’s hurt!”<br />
I am not pretending that there is anything new about any of this; the
whole theory of credit implies the probability of some such
happenings.<br />
(During the Skirmish [1914-1918 e.v.] some small town in Northern Mexico
got cut off by warring presidential brigands from the rest of the
country, and got on perfectly well for a year or more without any money
or commerce at all, on a basis of good-neighbourly feeling. Similar
principles at Cefalu; three years without a single quarrel about money.
We used to say: “There’s no harm in money until you begin to count it!”)
Trouble comes from Fear, and from Restriction.<br />
When I first landed in the U.S.A. (1900) I noticed instantly that
practically everybody seemed to have money to burn, defying statistics.
“Oh, that’s simple!” explained a banker to whom I mentioned it; “in this
country we reckon that money circulates 9 times as fast as in England.
One dollar does the work of nine.” Then, a year later at San Francisco,
everything seemed very dear.” Why? In S.F. one hardly ever saw a copper
coin; the nickel (2 1/2d) was the smallest in practical use. Going on to
Honolulu, it was twice as bad; and there the dime (5d) was the smallest
coin one ever saw.<br />
Somehow, it made for stickiness. When one hesitates to pay money out,
one cannot expect other people to feel otherwise. So everything becomes
increasingly constipated. I am not denying the virtues of thrift, but
it’s a long and tedious business; and all the big fortunes are made by
shrewd gambling. Even if your policy be “small profits,” it is a failure
unless it ensures “quick returns.” This is the deeper meaning of the
proverb “time is money.”<br />
Then, isn’t there a little Bonus? Isn’t it worth something to have a
pleasant life, and to have people like you. It leaps to the eye if one
is a “tightwad;” the Saturnian constriction shows itself in a myriad
ways. “The liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall be
watered also himself.”<br />
Now, then expand your thought; from he consideration of money (which we
chose merely for convenience of discussion) apply these principles to
the spheres of all the other planets. You will very soon heighten the
enjoyment of life beyond all measure and belief!</p>

<h3 id="chapter-lv-money">Chapter LV: Money</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You ask me for the initiated view about the power of money. As the
poet says: “O.k. oke; I’m yer bloke.” F. Marion Crawford, a Victorian
novelist, now (I think deservedly) obsolescent, thought I saw one of his
books last week on the shelves of a tuppenny shark-library, wrote a tale
Mr Isaacs based on the life of one Mr Jacobs, the Indian Rothschild of
two generations ago, financing princes, little wars—everything. One
night in Bombay the burden of his wealth broke his nerve; he stood at
the window of his hotel, and flung masses of money to the mob. Soon
after came a stranger, and said to him, “You have insulted the fourth of
the great powers that rule this world; it shall be taken from you.” It
was so; he lost all. In the end he became, after a fashion, Sannyasi,
and died (I suppose) in the usual odour.<br />
I thought of this incident in Paris in the twenties, when I saw American
tourists plaster the bonnets of their cars with 1000 franc notes, or
tear them up and strew the floors of banks with them. Grimly I
prognosticated Twenty-Nine. And it was so.<br />
“Nice work!” you charmingly remark; but hardly what I sought to know.”
Patience, child!<br />
Money being the fourth great power, “what are the other three?” Come,
come, you can surely do that in your head. Four’s Tetragrammaton, isn’t
it?<br />
Very well, then! The First Great Power is Yod, the Father. Fire, the
Wand, the Flame of Creative Genius. The Second is Hè, the Mother, Water,
the Cup, the Sea to which all things tend; it is the gift of pleasing,
of absorbing, of drawing all things to oneself.<br />
The Third is Vau, the Son, the Sword, the moving, penetrating element,
double in nature. For it is intellect, but also the result of Genius
absorbed, interpreted, transmuted and applied through the virtue of the
Cup to expand, to explain, to bring into conscious existence.<br />
And the Fourth is the Hè final, the Daughter, Earth, the Disk, Pantacle,
or Coin—the Coin on which is stamped the effigy of the Word that begat
it with the aid of the other forms of Energy. It is the Princess of the
Tarot of whom it is written: “Great indeed is her power when thus firmly
established.”<br />
No money-lender in the drunkenness of guilt plus the delirium of cocaine
fortified by buckets of hashish would dare dream of getting such
interest on his capital as these vampires. It is a trite, and not quite
true, saying that money can buy nothing worth having. But it can command
service, the real measure of power, and leisure; without these two
advantages the most brilliant genius is practically paralysed. It can do
much to secure health, or to restore it. The truth is that money is only
troublesome when one begins to count it.<br />
(This epigram is copyright in Basutoland, the United States of America,
the Republic of San Marino, the Sanjak of Novibazar, Arabia Petraea, and
the Scandinavian countries.)<br />
Then there is travel, by which I do not mean globe-trotting; and
privacy, less attainable every year as the Meddlesome Matties invade
every corner of life.<br />
But this is by the way; the text, tenor and thesis of the illuminated
and illuminating discourse is the above Epigram, which is not merely one
of the extravagant absurdities for which I am justly infamous.<br />
It is the Pearl of Great Price. Observe that, formally it is a
generalisation of the principle of the old injunction “to buy the egg of
a perfectly black hen without haggling.” I want you to realise the
supreme importance of this. For one thing, it goes hand-in-hand with the
whole doctrine of so-called renunciation—which is nothing of the sort.
You don’t “renounce” five shillings if you pay that for a country house
with 3000 acres of shooting, and the best salmon fishing on Deeside, do
you? This is the Greater Interpretation of the Injunction, that no
equation is possible: Magical Power is immeasurably more valuable than
any amount of money. But the Epigram is severely practical. It may sound
a little romantic, but—here goes! A community which thinks in terms of
wealth is rich; in terms of money, poor. How so? Because the former
includes the imponderables.<br />
A couple of Japanese wrestlers may be worth more than Phidias, Robert
Browning, Titian and Mozart in terms of butchers’ meat. We might alter
that incorrect truism “money cannot buy anything worth having” to
“things worth having cannot be estimated in terms of money.” You see, no
counting. The operation to save your child’s life: do you care if the
surgeon wants five pounds or fifty? Of course, you may not have the
fifty, or be obliged to retrench in other ways to get it; but it makes
no odds as to what you feel about it. What is the value of a University
Education? The answer is that it is a pure gamble. The student may use
his advantages to make a rich marriage, to attract the wife of a
millionaire, to earn a judgeship or a post in the Cabinet, to earn £500
a year as a doctor, £150 as a schoolmaster—or he may die in the process.
So with all the spiritual values; they are, in the most literal sense,
inestimable. So—don’t start to count!<br />
Most obviously of all, when it comes to The Great Work, money does not
count at all. I do not write of any Magical work, in the restricted
sense of the phrase. Shaw says: “Admirals always want more battleships”
and J.F.C. Fuller: “if a lawyer, more wretches to hang.” It applies to
any one whose heart is in his job. (Of course, in this case, money is
like all other things of value; nothing counts but the Job.) This, too,
is sound Magical doctrine.<br />
Lack of money is another matter altogether.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-lvi-marriagepropertywarpolitics">Chapter LVI:
Marriage—Property—War—Politics</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Directly or indirectly, you have already all you need about marriage
in its relation to Magical Training.<br />
The Hindu proverb sums it all up: “There are seven kinds of wife—like a
mother, a sister, a daughter, a mistress, a friend, an enemy and a
slave; of these the only good one is the last.”<br />
But from your questions I gather that what you want is advice on how to
advise, how marriage as an institution is regarded by The Book of the
Law. Very good.<br />
It is not actually mentioned; but that it is contemplated is shown by
the use of the word “wife”— AL I, 41.. The text confirms my own thesis
“There shall be no property in human flesh.” So long as this is observed
I see no reason why two or more people should not find it convenient to
make a contract according to the laws of customs of their
community.<br />
But my above thesis is all important; note the fury of denunciation in
AL I, 41-42!<br />
As to property in general, the Book lays down no law. So far as one can
see, it seems to adhere to “the good old rule, the simple plan that they
should take who have the power, and they should keep who can.”<br />
I think that your best course is to work out all such problems for
yourself; at least it is an admirable if arduous, mental exercise. One
ought, theoretically, to be able to deduce the ideal system from the
Magical Formula of the Aeon of Horus.<br />
Now then, as to war. You need hardly have asked the question; the whole
Book is alive with it; it thrills, it throbs, it tingles on almost every
page. It even goes into details. Strategy: “Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them!
…” AL III, 9. Then AL III, 3-8. England, I suppose. Verse 6 suggests the
mine-layer to anyone who has seen one in action. Verse 7 might refer to
the tank or the aeroplane—or to something we haven’t yet got.<br />
Notice also Verse 28 , a surprising conclusion to the long magical
instruction about the “Cakes of Light.” Then the mysterious opening of
Verse 46 demands attention and research! Can “…the Forties:…” refer to
the years ’39 (e.v.) onward—will this war last till ’49 (e.v.)? Can the
“…Eighties…” be symbolic, as the decade in which universal peace seemed
to nearly everybody as assured for an indefinite period?<br />
There are any number of other passages, equally warlike; but see II, 24.
It is a warning against internecine conflict between the masters; see
also III 58, 59. Hitler might well quote these two reminders that the
real danger is the revolt of the slave classes. They cannot rule or
build; no sooner do they find themselves in a crisis than mephitic
rubbish about democracy is swept into the dustbin by a Napoleon or a
Stalin.<br />
There is just one exception to the general idea of ruthlessness; some
shadowy vision of a chivalrous type of warfare is granted to us in AL
III, 59: Significant, perhaps, that this and a restatement of Thelema
came immediately before “There is an end of the word of the God
enthroned in Ra’s seat, lightening the girders of the soul.” (AL III,
61) And this is “As brothers fight ye!” Perhaps the Aeon may give birth
to some type of warfare “under Queensbury rules” so to say. A baptism of
those who assert their right to belong to the Master class. Something,
in short, not wholly dissimilar from the jousts of Feudal times. But on
such points I should not care to adventure any very positive
opinion.<br />
The last part of your question refers to politics. “The word politics
surprises by himself,” as Count Smorltork observed. Practically all
those parts of the Book which deal with social matters may be considered
as political in the old an proper sense of the word; of modern politics
it disdains to speak.</p>

LVII: Beings I have Seen with my Physical Eye</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Well do you know my lifelong rule never to make any assertion that
cannot be verified, or at least supported by corroborative evidence, on
any subject pertaining to Magick.<br />
When, therefore, you express curiosity as to how much of the normally
super-sensible world has been revealed to my senses, and especially that
of sight, you must take my answer as “without prejudice,” “e. and o.e.”,
“under the rose,” and “in a Pickwickian sense.” If you choose to call me
a lunatic and/or a liar, I shall accept the verdict with mine accustomed
imperturbability. Whether what I am about to tell you is “true” or not
doesn’t matter, as in any case it proves nothing in particular. What
does matter is to accept nothing whatever from the “Astral Plane”
without the most conclusive and irrefragable internal evidence.<br />
That is enough for the caveat part of it; now I plunge direct into the
autobiographical.<br />
I begin with my childhood. There is one incident, not quite relevant in
this place, but yet of such supreme significance that I dare not omit
it. I must have been about 6 years old. I was capering round my father
during a walk through the meadows. He pointed out a bunch of nettles in
the corner of the field, close to the gate (I can see it quite clearly
today!) and told me that if I touched them they would sting. Some word,
gesture, or expression of mine caused him to add: Would you rather be
told, or learn by experience? I replied, instantly: I would rather learn
by experience. Suiting the action to the word, I dashed forward, plunged
in the clump, and learnt.<br />
This incident is the key to the puzzle of my character. But, as a child,
what did I see? I cannot think of any one person who subsequently
devoted his life to Magick who has not at least one early experience of
seeing angels, or fairies, or something of the sort. But A.C.? Nary a
one. I was brought up on the Bible, a literalist, fundamentalist—all
that a Plymouth Brother could wish. It never occurred to me to doubt a
word of what I was told. Perhaps the Wolf’s Tail of an healthy
scepticism gleamed pale at the age of 10, when I asked my form master
how it was that Christ managed to be dead for three days and three
nights between Friday night and Sunday morning. He said that he did not
know, and (to a further question) that no one had ever explained it.
This merely filled me with ambition to be the great exegetist who had
explained it. I never thought of doubting the story.<br />
Well, all this time, and then through puberty, despite my romantic bent,
my absorption in the gramarye of Sir Walter Scott, my imaginative life
as one of his heroes, and the rest of it. I never had even a moment’s
illusion that anything of the sort had ever happened to me. I went
through all the motions; I haunted all the places where such things are
reputed likely to happen, but nothing did happen.<br />
There is one exception, and one only.<br />
It was in 1896, at Arolla in the Pennine Alps. I took my cousin, Gregor
Grant, a fine climber but with little experience beyond scrambles, and
in poor physical condition, for the second (first guideless) ascent of
the N.N.E. ridge of Mont Collon, a long and exacting climb of more than
average difficulty. I had to help him with the rope for most of the
climb. This made us late. I dashed for the quickest way down, a short
but very steep ridge with one decidedly bad patch, to the great
snowfield at the head of the valley. At the bottom of the last pitch a
scree-strewn slope, easy going, led to the snows.<br />
We took off the rope, and I sat down to coil it and light a pipe, while
he wandered down. By this time I was as tired as 14 dogs, each one more
tired than all the rest put together; what I call “silly tired.” I took
a chance (for nightfall was near) on resting 5 or 10 minutes. Restored,
I sprang to my feet, threw the coiled rope over my shoulder, and started
to run down. But I was too tired to run; I slackened off.<br />
Then, to my amazement, I saw of the slopes below me, two little fellows
hopping playfully about on the scree. (A moment while I remind you that
all my romance was Celtic; I had never ever read Teutonic myths and
fables.) But these little men were exactly the traditional gnome of
German foldtales; the Heinzelmänner that one sees sometimes on German
beer-mugs (I have never drunk beer in my life) and in friezes on the
walls of a Conditorei.<br />
I hailed them cheerfully—at first I thought they were some of the local
nobility and gentry of a type I had not yet encountered; but they took
no notice, just went on playing about. They were still at it when I
reached my cousin, sheltering behind some boulders at the foot of the
slope; and I saw no more of them.<br />
I saw them as plainly as I ever saw anything; there was nothing ghostly
or semi-transparent about them.<br />
A curious point is that I attached no significance to this. I asked my
cousin if he had seen them; he said no.<br />
My mind accepted the incident as simply as if I had seen Chamois. Yet
even to-day when I have seen lots and lots of things more wonderful,
this incident stands out as the simplest and clearest of all my
experiences. I give myself full marks!<br />
“Why?” Isn’t it obvious? It means that I am not the semi-hysterical type
who takes wish-phantasms for facts. When I started seriously to study
and practice Magick in the Autumn of ’98 e.v., I wished and wished with
all my might; but I never got anything out of it.<br />
With the exception above recorded, my first experiences were the direct
result of intense magical effort on the traditional lines; there was no
accident about it; when I evoked N to visible appearance, I got N and
nobody else. But even so, there isn’t much to splash!<br />
The first definitely physical sight was due to the “evocation to visible
appearance” of the Goetia demon Buer by myself and V.H. Frater “Volo
Noscere.”1 (Our object was to prolong the life, in imminent danger, of
V.H. Frater Iehi Aour—Allan Bennett—Bhikkhu Ananda Metteya—and was
successful; he lived another 20 odd years. And odd years they
were!)<br />
I was wide awake, keyed up, keenly observant at the time.<br />
The temple was approximately 16 feet by 8, and 12 high. A small “double-
cube” altar of acacia was in the centre of a circle; outside this was a
triangle in which it was proposed to get the demon to appear. The room
was thick with the smoke of incense, some that of Abramelin, but mostly,
in a special censer in the triangle, Dittany of Crete (we decided to use
this, as H.P.B. once said that its magical virtue was greater than that
of any other herb).<br />
As the ceremony proceeded, we were aware that the smoke was not uniform
in thickness throughout the room, but tended to be almost opaquely dense
in some parts of it, all but clear in others. This effect was much more
definite than could possibly be explained by draughts, of by our own
movements. Presently it gathered itself together still more completely,
until it was roughly as if a column of smoke were rising from the
triangle, leaving the rest of the room practically clear.<br />
Finally, at the climax of the ritual—we had got as far as the “stronger
and more potent conjuration”—we both saw, vaguely enough, but yet beyond
doubt, parts of a quite definite figure. In particular, there was a
helmet suggesting Athene (or horror! Brittania!), part of a tunic or
chlamys, and very solid footgear. (I thought of “the well-greaved
Greeks.”) Now this was very far from satisfactory; it corresponded in no
wise with the appearance of Buer which the Goetia had led us to expect.
Worse, this was as far as it went; no doubt, seeing it at all had
disturbed our concentration. (This is where training in Yoga would have
helped our Magick.) From that point it was all a wash-out. We could not
get back the enthusiasm necessary to persist. We called it a day, did
the banishings, closed the<br />
temple, and went to bed with our tails between our legs.<br />
(And yet, from a saner point of view, the Operation had been a shining
success. “Miraculous” things began to happen; in one way and another the
gates opened for Allan to migrate to less asthmatic climes; and the
object of our work was amply attained.)<br />
I give prominence to this phenomenon because what we saw, little and
unsatisfactory as it was, appeared to our normal physical sight. I
learned later that there is a kind of sight half-way between that and
the astral. In a “regular” astral vision one sees better when the eyes
are shut; with this intermediate instrument, to close them would be as
completely annihilating as if the vision were an ordinary object of
sight.<br />
It seems, too, as if I had picked up something of the sort as an
aftereffect of the Evocation of Buer—a Mercurial demon; for phenomena of
one sort or another were simple showered on me from this moment, pari
passu with my constantly improving technique in regular “astral
visions.” Sometimes I was quite blind, as compared with Frater V.N.; for
when the circles was broken one nightùsee the whole story in my
Autohagiography—he saw and identified dozens and scores of Abramelin
demons as they marched widdershins around my library, while all I saw of
them was a procession of “halfformed faces” moving shadowy through the
dimly-lit room.<br />
When it was a matter of the sense of touch, it was far otherwise; I got
it good and hearty—but that is not the subject of this letter. I find
all this excessively tedious; I resent having to write about it at all;
I wonder whether I am breaking some beastly by-law; in fact, I shall ask
you to be content with Buer as far as details go; I never saw anything
of importance with purely physical sight with anything like the clarity
of my adventure on Mont Collon.<br />
Yes, as I think it over, that by-law is to thank. This Spring I saw very
plainly, on four separate occasions, various beings of another order
than ours. I was ass enough to tell one or two pupils about it…<br />
And I’ve never been able to see any more. This, however, it is a
positive duty to tell you. One can acquire the power of seeing, with
this kind of sight that is neither wholly normal nor wholly astral, all
the natural inhabitants of the various places that one reaches in one’s
travels; one can make intimate contact with individual “elementals” as
closely as one can with human beings or animals, although the relation
is rarely continuous or permanent.<br />
The conditions of such intercourse are complex: (a) one must have the
necessary degree of initiation, magical efficiency, and natural ability;
(b) one must be at the time in the appropriate magical state, or mood;
(c) both parties must desire to make the contact, or else one must be
lawfully the superior, a master and slave relationship, (d) the magical
conditions at the time must be suitable and propitious; e.g., one would
not make love to a salamandrine during a sandstorm. Of course, like all
operations, any such efforts must be justified by their consonance with
one’s True Will.<br />
On this note I end this abortive letter.</p>

<p>Chapter LVIII: “Do Angels Ever Cut Themselves Shaving?”</p>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>A very witty way to put it! “Do angels ever cut themselves shaving?”
Rem acu tetigisti,1 again.<br />
(English: you big tease?)<br />
What sort of existence, what type or degree of reality, do we attribute
to them? (By angel, of course, you mean any celestial—or infernal—being
such as are listed in the Hierarchy, from Metatron and Ratziel to Lilith
and Nahema.) We read of them, for the most part, as if they were
persons—although of another order of being; as individual, almost, as
ourselves. The principal difference is that they are not, as we are,
microcosmic. The Angels of Jupiter contain all the Jupiter there is,
within these limits, that their rank is not as high as their Archangel,
nor as low as their Intelligence or their Spirit. But their Jupiter is
pure Jupiter; no other planet enters into their composition.<br />
We see and hear them, usually (in my own experience) as the result of
specific invocation. Less frequently we know them through the sense of
touch as well; sometimes their presence is associated with a particular
perfume. (This, by the way, is very striking, since it has to overcome
that of the incense.) I must very strongly insist, at this point, on the
difference between “gods” and “angels.”<br />
Gods are macrocosmic, as we microcosmic: an incarnated (materialised)
God is just as much a person, an individual animal, as we are; as such,
he appeals to all our senses exactly as if he were “material.”<br />
But everything sensible is matter in some state or other; how then are
we to regard an Angel, complete with robes, weapons, and other
impedimenta? (I have never known a god thus encumbered, when he has been
“materialised” at all. Of course, the mere apparition of a God is
subject to laws similar to those governing the visions of angels.)<br />
For one thing, all the laws that we find in operation on various parts
of the “Astral Plane” are valid.<br />
Two things can occupy the same place at the same time. They are “swift
without feet, and flying without wings.”2 They change size, shape,
appearance, appurtenances of all sorts, at will. Anything that is
required for the purpose of the vision is there at will. They bring
their own background with them. They are able to transfer a portion of
their energy to the seer by spontaneous action without appreciable
means.<br />
But here is where you question arises—what is their “life” like? In the
visions, they never do anything but “go through the motions” appropriate
to their nature and to the character of the vision.<br />
Are we to conclude that the whole set of impressions is no more than
symbolic? Is it all a part of oneself, like a daydream, but a daydream
intensified and made “real” because its crucial incidents turn out to be
true, as must always occur during the testing of the genuineness of the
vision?<br />
Shall we infringe Sir William Hamilton’s Law of Parsimony if we extend
our conception of our own powers, and conclude that the vision is but a
manifestation of our Unconscious, presented in a symbolic form
convenient for our understanding?<br />
I’m sorry, but I can’t let it go at that! Some of my own experiences
have been so confoundedly objective that it just won’t work. So there we
are back to your original question about shaving and I fear me sorely
that “Occam’s razor” will help us no whit.<br />
It seems to me much simpler to say that these Angels are “real”
individuals, although living in a world of whose laws we have no
conception; and that, in order to communicate with us, they make use of
the symbolic forms appropriate; employ, in short, the language of the
Astral Plane.<br />
After all, it’s only fair; for that is precisely what we do to them when
we invoke them.<br />
Ha! Ha! Ha! I suppose you think you’ve caught me out in an evasion
there! Not so, dear child, not so: this state of affairs is nothing
strange.<br />
Ask yourself: “What do I know of Therion’s mode of life?” Whenever I see
him, he’s always on his best behaviour.” I’ve hardly ever seen him eat;
perhaps he does so only when I am there, so as not to embarrass me by a
display of his holiness.” His universe touches mine at only a very few
points.”<br />
The mere fact of his being a man, and I a woman, makes sympathetic
understanding over a vast range of experience almost impossible,
certainly imperfect.” Then all his reading and his travels touch mine at
very few points.” And his ignorance of music makes it an almost
grotesque extension of magnanimity for me to admit his claim to belong
to the human species . . . U.S.W.3” Then: “How do we manage to
communicate at all? There is bound to be an impassable gulf between us
at the best, when one considers that his connotation of the commonest
words like ‘mountain’, ‘girl’, ‘school’, ‘Hindu’, ‘oasis’, is so vastly
different from mine. But to do it at all! What actually have we
done?”<br />
Think it out!<br />
We have made a set of queerly-shaped marks on a sheet of paper, given
them names, attached a particular sound to each, made up (God knows how
and why!) combinations of these, given names and sounds to them too, and
attached a meaning—hardly ever the same for you as for me—to them, made
combinations of these too according to a set of quite arbitrary rules,
agreed—so far as agreement is possible, or even thinkable—to label a
thought with some such arrangement: and there we are! You have in this
fantastically artificial way succeeded in conveying your thought to my
mind.<br />
Now, turn back to Magick; read there how we work to establish
intelligible intercourse between ourselves and the “angels.”<br />
If you can find any difference between that method and this, it is more
than I can.<br />
Finally, please remember as a general rule that all magical experience
is perfectly paralleled by the simplest and commonest phenomena of our
daily life!<br />
People who tell you that it is “all quite different beyond the Veil” or
what not, are blithering incompetents, totally ignorant of the nature of
things.<br />
Incidentally, Bertrand Russell has given us a superb mathematical proof
of this theorem; but I won’t afflict you with it at this time of
asking.<br />
On the contrary, I will tell you more about “communication.”<br />
There is a method of using Ethyl Oxide which enables one (a) to analyse
one’s thoughts with a most exquisite subtlety and accuracy, (b) to find
out—in the French phrase—“what is at the bottom of the bottle.” By this
they mean the final result of any project or investigation; and this,
surprisingly often, is not at all what it is possible to discover by any
ordinary means.<br />
For instance, one might ask oneself “Do I believe in God?” and, after a
vast number of affirmative answers of constantly increasing depth and
subtlety, discover with a shock that “at the bottom of the bottle” one
believed nothing of the sort! Or vice versa.<br />
On one occasion the following experiment was carried out. A certain
Adept was to make use of the Sacred Vapour, and when the time seemed
ripe, to answer such questions as should be put to him by his Scribe.
Presently, after about an hour’s silence, the Scribe asked: “Is
communication possible?”<br />
But this he meant merely to enquire whether it would now be in order for
him to begin to ask his prepared list of questions.<br />
But the Adept thought that this was Question No. 1: meaning “Is there
any valid means of making contact between two minds?”<br />
He remained intensely silent—intensely, as opposed to his previous
rather fidgety abstention from talking—for a very long time, and then
broke slowly into a long seductive ripple of hushed laughter, suggestive
of the possession of some ineffably delicious secret, of a moonlight
revel of Pan with his retinue of Satyrs, nymphs and fauns.<br />
I shall say no more, save to express the hope that you have understood

<h3 id="chapter-lix-geomancy">Chapter LIX: Geomancy</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Your last letter has really put me up a gum tree. I do not see how I
can write you an account of Geomancy. At first sight it looks as if all
I could do was to refer you to the official text book of that sublime
and difficult art. You will find in the Equinox, Volume I, No. 2. (or am
I mistaken and it is No. 4?) I cannot bother to refer to it, and the
books are not under my hand.1<br />
There is, of course, a short account in Magick and I do not think that
it is a very satisfactory one, certainly not in view of what you have
asked me. No, it certainly won’t do at all.<br />
The main point of your letter appears to be a question as to whether I
think it worth your while to devote a great amount of time to it;
whether its usefulness repays the pains required to master it.<br />
Now here we come to a question of personality. The first thing to
remember about Geomancy is that although the various intelligences are
attributed to the twelve signs of the Zodiac they all appertain to the
element of earth. Anyone therefore who has got in his nativity an earthy
sign rising, or the sun in an earthly sign, or a good proportion of
planets in an earthy sign, is much more likely to find Geomancy
attractive than anyone the principal features of whose horoscope are
devoted to other elements, especially air, which of course is the enemy
of earth.<br />
Now these remarks apply of course very much to the type of question that
is likely to be within the grasp of the Geomantic Intelligences that
must certainly be considered as well as the natural faculty of the
practitioner to master the art.<br />
I ought of course to emphasize that I am just the worst person in the
habitable globe that you could have asked about this matter, as my
rising sign and my planets are all in fire, air, or water, except
Neptune, which as Astrology teaches, refers not so much to the Native as
to the period of life.<br />
It has accordingly been exceptionally difficult for me to be of much use
to people who have come to me with enquiries similar to yours, still
more when they have planted themselves down solidly at my feet and
insisted on my teaching them. There is, however, a certain meagre
harvest to be gained from my experience. I should like to tell you what
happened to such a man.2<br />
A resident of Johannesburg and singularly gifted with the power of
getting physical results to take place as a result of Magical
experiments. This man was as strongly attracted to Geomancy as I was
repelled, and I do not know that it would be fair for me to claim that I
had been of any special use to him, though he was always kind enough to
say so.<br />
When I pointed out that the answers to Geomantic questions were so vague
and indeterminate he had already devised a method whereby this
difficulty (which he admitted as existing) could be overcome.<br />
It is of course of the very first importance in Geomancy to frame your
questions accurately; for the Intelligences serving the Art delight in
tricksome gambols. If there is a possibility of assigning a double
meaning to the question you can bank on their finding it, and deceiving
you.<br />
Of all this my disciple was well aware; and he had become extremely
artful in allowing no ambiguity to spoil any of his questions.<br />
But as to the further difficulty about their vagueness, what he did was
to arrange a series of questions narrowing the issue step by step until
he had succeeded in obtaining a precise instruction which would resolve
his original difficulty.<br />
I do think, as a matter of fact, that I was able to help to some extent
on the purely theoretical side of the Art, and he went back to South
Africa feeling himself fully equipped to deal with any problem that
might arise.<br />
At that time we were particularly anxious to wind up the first volume of
the Equinox with a No. 10, which should be a really massive contribution
to Magical thought. That meant a very considerable increase in the cost
of production. All this my Disciple, of course, knew, and on arriving in
Johannesburg he said to himself “Well, here I am in a part of the world
where the earth teams with gold and diamonds. I will procure the
necessary funds for the Equinox and various other financial necessities
of the Work by Geomantic divination.<br />
Now, then, he thought, in and about Johannesburg we have both gold and
diamonds; that is exactly the chance for these tricky earth spirits to
take advantage of the ambiguity. I will therefore frame the question so
as to cover both sources of riches. I will not specify gold or diamonds.
I will say simply”mineral wealth.”<br />
The answers to his series of questions indicated that he was to go out
of the city where he would find a deposit.<br />
The next questions in his series were directed to finding the direction
in which he should start his exploration. That was easy.<br />
The next question was the distance involved, and he could think of no
way of framing questions which would inform him on that very important
point. He got at it indirectly, however, by asking as to his means of
transport, and as to that the answer was quite clear and
unmistakable.<br />
He was to use a horse.<br />
Well, he had a Boer pony, and next morning he set forth with provisions
for a day’s journey.<br />
On and on he went and found no geological indication of any mineral
wealth. Presently he began to get tired and thought it was a little
late. He could see in every direction across the Veldt and there was
nothing at all. A mile or so in front of him, however, was a row of
small kopjes. He said, I may as well go on and get a view from the
top.<br />
This he did; and there was still no geological pointer. It struck him,
however, that he was getting short of water; and just below on the far
side of the kopje were a number of apparently shallow pools.<br />
“I will fill my skin and give my horse a drink and get home feeling like
a fool.”<br />
But, when he got to the water, his horse turned sharply aside and
refused to drink. At that he dismounted and put his finger in the water
to test it. He had struck one of the most important deposits of alkali
in South Africa. Mineral wealth indeed!<br />
He went home rejoicing and took the necessary steps to protect his find.
In the course of the formalities he found it necessary to come to
London, which he did, and told me the whole story.<br />
Unfortunately we end with an anti-climax. The negotiations went wrong;
and the property was stolen from under his nose by one of the big alkali
firms. However, it was a good mark for Geomancy.<br />
I am afraid that all this is a digression. As I indicated above, what
you want to know is to be found in the official instruction on the
subject in the Equinox.<br />
Now far be it from me to cast any doubt on any official instruction, but
I cannot help saying that in this particular instance it does not give
very full details, and I think you would be well advised to investigate
the whole subject afresh, basing you enquiry on the general principles
of the science.<br />
You will presumably have noticed that the Geomantic figures are derived
from taking the permutations of two things, four at a time, just as the
trigrams of Fu-Hsi are two things taken three at a time, and the
Hexagrams of the Yi are two things taken six at a time.<br />
The system is consequently based upon 16 figures and no more. Of course
all systems of divinations which have any claim to be reasonable are
based upon a map of the universe, or at least the Solar system, and 16
is really rather a limited number of units to manipulate.<br />
However, if you are the type of person who has a natural bent towards
this particular Art you will be able to develop it on your own lines,
guided by your own experience.<br />
I do not think there is anything further to add to these scattered
remarks except that so far as I know none of the treatises on the
subject (with the single exception of the official instruction) are of
any use at all.<br />
I feel rather acutely how unsatisfactory these remarks must sound to
you, but it is the best that I can do for you. You must regard it either
as an excuse, or a confession of incompetence, that I have always had
this instinctive distaste for the subject.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>

<p>1: The item on “Geomancy” is in Equinox, Vol I, No. 2. The method
provided there is the French adaptation of an African method like the
Ifa Oracle of the Yoruba people at Great Zimbabwe. This technique has
superficial similarities to the Yi King, and four-line Geomancy was
known in Europe from late Medieval times. The Geomancy mentioned in The
Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin and in a few stories of the Arabian Nights is
usually based on recognition of shapes, including Arabic letters, in
randomly disturbed sand. This French method uses a count of odd or even
in a series of random strikes against a sand or earth surface to
determine the figure – WEH.<br />
The instruction in the Equinox is taken almost verbatim from a Golden
Dawn paper, itself adapted from the treatise on Geomancy attributed to
Agrippa which was published in the 16th century (see Agrippa, Opera,
vol. I). Certain crucial omissions were made and the method was
delineated very unclearly; the version in Regardie (ed.) The Golden Dawn
is more intelligible although it omits some of<br />
the tables which appear in the Equinox publication – T.S.<br />

Windram, Frater Semper Paratus, who later became head of the South
African section of the O.T.O. under Crowley – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lx-knack">Chapter LX: Knack</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>I am very glad that it has not been necessary in all this long
correspondence with you, to discuss the question of Knack. You seem to
be specially gifted; you were able to get the results directly from
following out the instructions, and I am glad that it is through you, on
behalf of other people, to whom you have communicated these
instructions, that this letter has become necessary.<br />
When Otto Morningstar was trying (with indifferent success) to teach me
how to play French Billiards in Mexico City I found one particular
difficulty, and that was how to play the massé shot. He kept on
explaining and explaining and demonstrating and demonstrating, and none
of it seemed any good. I understood intellectually, well enough; but
somehow or other it never came off. Presently he said that he guessed he
knew what was the matter. Although I had the whole thing perfect in my
mind I had not made the link between my mind, my eye and my hand, and
what I must do was not to go to him for teaching, of which I had had
already enough and more than enough. He told me if I went on trying it
would happen quite suddenly and unexpectedly one day that I found I
could do it. This was particularly decent of him because it was in
direct contradiction with his financial interest. But he was an
all-round good man.<br />
So I cut him out so far as the massé shot was concerned and redoubled my
practice of it. What he said came out right; one day I found that I had
acquired the knack of it.<br />
Now with these semi-pupils of yours the same thing probably
applies.<br />
The point you raise in particular as baffling them is the getting on to
the astral plane. It is not much good explaining why the failure occurs,
or at what point it occurs; the only thing that is any use is for the
pupil to go on and on and on eternally. He must find out for himself
where the snag is, and he must continue his experiment until he acquires
the knack.<br />
All this should be perfectly obvious; the same sort of thing applies to
every kind of game which you know. There is a particular knack for
instance in putting. It is not that your calculations are wrong, it is
not that your stance is wrong, it is not that your grip is wrong, it is
that for some reason or other you fail to coordinate all these various
factors in the problem; and sooner or later the moment comes when it
appears to you quite natural to succeed in getting out of the body, or
in opening the eyes on the astral plane, or in getting hold of the
particular form of elemental energy which has until that moment escaped
you.<br />
I have mentioned the question of astral journeys because that is one
which in your experience, as indeed it has been in mine, is the one that
most frequently occurs.<br />
I do not know why it is that people should get so easily discouraged as
they do. I can only suggest that it is because they are touching so
sensitive a spot in their spiritual and magical organisation that it
upsets them; they feel as if they were completely hopeless in a much
more serious way than if it was a matter of learning some trick in some
such game as chess or billiards.<br />
Of course, the worst of it is that failure in these early stages is
liable to destroy their confidence in the teacher, and I think it would
be a very wise plan on your part to warn them about that.<br />
I ought incidentally to mention that this sudden illumination—that is
not quite the right word but I cannot think of a better one—is quite
different to the sudden confidence which takes hold of one in the Yoga
practices, the more I think of it the more I feel that the question of
sensitiveness is of the greatest importance.<br />
In Yoga practices one does not, at least as far as my experience goes,
come against the delicacy that one does in all magical and astral
practices. The reason for what is, I think, quite obvious. All the Yoga
practices are ultimately of the protective type, whereas with magical
and astral practices one is exposing oneself to the contact of exterior
(or apparently exterior) forces. In neither case, however, is there any
sort of reason at all for discouragement; and as I said above the cure
in all cases is apparently the same.<br />
In one way or another the veil is rent, the pupil becomes the master,
and the reason for that is really rather beyond my analysis so far as
that has gone at present. I do not know whether it is some kind of
awakening of some faculty of the magical self, though that seems to me
the simplest and most probable explanation; but in any case there is no
doubt about the nature of the experience, and there can be no difficulty
about the recognition of it when it occurs.<br />
Now, dear Sister, I hope that this letter may be of real use to you in
dealing with those difficult semipupils. In particular I hope that you
will make a point of insisting on how encouraging this doctrine
is.<br />
Your pupils must not calculate; that indeed is one point where the
magical record is rather a hindrance than otherwise.<br />
It reminds me of the story of the Psychologist who wanted to judge the
difference in temperament between an Englishman, a Scotsman and an
Irishman, in judging the amount of Whisky in a bottle in the next room.
They had to go in, report, and come back, and tell him what they thought
about it.<br />
He filled it 50% with great accuracy.<br />
The Irishman came back fairly cheerful; he rubbed his hands; “Well,
there’s half a bottle left, your honour.”<br />
When the Scotsman came back his face was full of gloom: “I’m afraid,” he
says, “that half a bottle has gone.”<br />
Then the Englishman had his turn. He came in all over smiles, rubbing
his hands, and said: “There’s not a drop left, so that’s that.”<br />
Moral—Be English!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxi-power-and-authority">Chapter LXI: Power and
Authority</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your last letter. I expected no less. As soon as
anybody gets into a position of authority, even on a very small scale,
their troubles begin on a very large one.<br />
Imagine, if you can, what I have been through in the last quarter of a
century or more. My subordinates are always asking me for advancement in
the Order; they think that if they were only members of the 266th degree
everything in the garden would be lovely. They think that if they only
possessed the secrets of the 148th degree they would be able to perform
all those miracles which at present escape them.<br />
These poor fish! They do not understand the difference between Power and
Authority. They do not understand that there are two kinds of degrees,
altogether different.<br />
For instance, in the theory of the Church of Rome a bishop is a person
on whom has been conferred the magical power to ordain priests. He may
choose a totally unworthy person for such ordination, it makes no
difference; and the priest, however unworthy he may be, has only to go
through the correct formulæ which perform the miracle of the Mass, for
that miracle to be performed. This is because in the Church we are
dealing with a religious as opposed to a magical or scientific
qualification. If the Royal Society elected a cobbler, as it could, it
would not empower the New Fellow to perform a boiling-point
determination, or read a Vernier.<br />
In our own case, though Our authority is at least as absolute as that of
the Pope and the Church of Rome, it does not confer upon me any power
transferable to others by any act of Our will. Our own authority came to
Us because it was earned, and when We confer grades upon other people
Our gift is entirely nugatory unless the beneficiary has won his
spurs.<br />
To put it in a slightly different form of words: Any given degree is, as
it were, a seal upon a precise attainment; and although it may please Us
to explain the secret or secrets of any given degree or degrees to any
particular person or persons, it is not of the slightest effect unless
he prove in his own person the ability to perform those functions which
all We have done is to give him the right to perform and the Knowledge
how to perform.<br />
The further you advance in the Order the more will you find yourself
pestered by people who have simply failed to understand this point of
Magical theory.<br />
Another thing is that the business of teaching itself is a very tricky
one; even such simple matters as traveling on the astral plane are not
to be attained by any amount of teaching unless the pupil has both the
capacity and the energy as well as the theoretical and intellectual
ability to carry out successfully the practices. (I have already said a
good deal about this in my letter on Knack.) I have thought it most
important that you should impress upon everybody these points. It is
absolutely pitiful to watch the vain struggle of the incompetent; they
are so earnest, so sincere, so worthy in every way of every possible
reward and yet they seem unable to advance a single step.<br />
There is another side to this matter which is really approximating to
the criminal. There are any number of teachers and masters and bishops
and goodness knows what else running around doing what is little better
than peddling grades and degrees and secrets. Such practices are of
course no better than common fraud.<br />
Please fix it firmly in your mind that with Us any degree, any position
of authority, any kind of rank, is utterly worthless except when it is
merely a seal upon the actual attainment or achievement.<br />
It must seem to you that I am beating a dead dog, that it is little
better than waste of time for me to keep on insisting, as I am now
doing, upon what any ordinary person would think was patent to the
meanest intelligence; but as a matter of plain fact the further you
advance in the Order, and the more people you get to know, the more you
find this attitude, sometimes absurd and sometimes abominable, getting
up and kicking you in the face.<br />
This is one of the reasons why the older I grow and the more experience
I have of human nature, the more am I convinced of the wisdom of the
Chiefs of the A.’. A.’., where association with any other person except
your immediate superior or the one of whom you are yourself in charge is
discouraged in every possible way.<br />
There are of course exceptions. It is necessary, though regrettably so,
for personal instruction in the practices to be given or received. For
all that, I wish I could show you 200 or 300 letters that I have
received in the last twenty years or so: they tell me without a shadow
of doubt that anything like fraternisation leads only to mischief. When
you wish instruction from your superior, it should be for definite
points and nothing else. Any breach of this convention is almost certain
to lead to one kind of trouble or another. It may in fact be regarded as
a defect of concentration if communication between any two members of
the Order should take place, except in cases of necessity.<br />
I know that it must seem hard to the weaker brethren of the Order that
we should make so little appearance of success in the Great Work to
which we are all pledged. It is so universal a convention that success
should be measured by members. People like to feel that they have
hundreds of Lodges from whom they can obtain assistance in moments of
discouragement.<br />
But a far truer and deeper satisfaction is found when the student has
contentedly gone on with his work all by his own efforts. Surely you
have had sufficient example in these letters, where in moments of
despair one suddenly awakes to the fact the despite all appearances one
has been watched and guarded from a higher plane. I might say, in fact,
that one such experience of the secret guardianship of the Chiefs of the
Order is worth a thousand apparently sufficient witnesses to the
facts.<br />
I would have you lay this closely to your heart, dear Sister, and
moreover always to keep in mind what I have written in this letter so
that you may be able to recognise when the occasion arises how much
better evidence of the power and intelligence of the Order is this to
being constantly cheered up along the difficult way by incidents such as
it is possible to explain by what might be considered normal
circumstances.<br />
Finally, let me insist that it is a definite symptom of Magical
ill-health when the craving for manifestation of that power and
intelligence come between the worker and his work.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxii-the-elastic-mind">Chapter LXII: The Elastic
Mind</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You ask me what I mean by an “elastic mind”—from our telephone
conversation on Friday.<br />
It is hard to define; but let me give you an example of the bad kind: an
old riddle. “Why is a story like a ghost?” Because<br />
“A story’s a tale<br />
a tail’s a brush<br />
a brush is a broom<br />
a brougham is a carriage<br />
a carriage is a gig<br />
a gig’s a trap<br />
a trap is a snare<br />
a snare’s a gin<br />
gin is a spirit<br />
and a spirit’s a ghost.”</p>
<p>You will have noticed a logical blunder—usually non distributio medii
or Hobson Jobson—at every step in the sorites. It is your instinctive,
or instructed, objection to commit these that prevents your mind from
actually moving on such lines.<br />
But these “correspondences,” such as they are, ought to present
themselves, be judged as false or true, and rejected or accepted
accordingly.<br />
The inelastic mind, on the other hand, is tied by training to a rigid
sequence, so that it never gets a chance to think for itself.<br />
To develop a mind properly it needs (a) “Lehrjahre” (a first-clas public
school and university education, or the equivalent) when it learns all
sides of a question, and is left free to judge for itself and (b)
“Wanderjahre,” when it sees the world for itself, not by any
pre-arranged course (Cooks’, Lunns’, University Extension, Baedeker) but
built up on the results of the Lehrjahre, foot or horseback, and avoid
beaten tracks.<br />
It is the Rosicrucian injunction to “wear the costume of the country in
which you are travelling;” this is only another way of saying “When in
Rome, do as the Romans do.” The object of this is not merely to avoid
interference or annoyance, but to teach the mind to think down to the
roots of the local customs. You learn also the great lesson of Thelema,
that nothing is right or wrong in itself: as we say “Circumstances alter
cases.” One trains oneself to adapt one’s life to the impinging facts:
to “cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth.” It leads one to the
understanding of that great Principle of Compromise which has kept
England’s head above water through the tempests of a chiliad.<br />
But always behind all these must be Will, the restraining and
controlling purposefulness which prevents one getting flabby, as worn
rubber does. (This is why no one is surprised to hear an ultraSocialist
minister deliver a speech that might have come from Pitt.) There must be
a perfect readiness of the mind to consider all the possible reactions
to any given situation, to judge exactly how far one should yield, and
in what direction, and to act accordingly; but always on keen guard
against the risk of snapping.<br />
Remember that the slightest sign of inelasticity means that the rubber
has already “perished;” and that the test of perfection is that one can
“Snap back” to the original condition, with no trace of the stress to
which it has been subjected.<br />
Beyond all, be armed against the “doctrinaire” type of mind, in yourself
or in another. One very soon falls into the habit of repeating ones pet
ideas; as the French say. “C’est enfoncer une porte ouverte;” and,
probably before you know it yourself, you have become that most obscene,
abhorred and incurable of human monsters, a BORE.<br />
I perceive a slight danger of this kind in the letter: moral, SHUT
UP!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxiii-fear-a-bad-astral-vision">Chapter LXIII: Fear, a
Bad Astral Vision</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Your letter of yesterday: so happy that my last was useful: but the
vision! I must have failed to make myself clear. We shall come to that
later in this letter.<br />
It is reassuring to learn that you are two-thirds human! Greed, anger
and sloth are the three Buddhist bed-rock badnesses; and you have
certainly given the last a miss in baulk. It is my own darkest and
deadliest foe, and oh how mighty! With me he never relaxes. Sounds a
paradox! but so it is.<br />
Now as to fear. In the Neophyte ceremony of G.’. D.’., when the bandage
is first removed from the eyes of the Aspirant, Horus, who was in that
Aeon “the Lord in the West,” tells him: “Fear is failure, and the
forerunner of failure: be thou therefore without fear for in the heart
of the coward virtue abideth not.”<br />
Listen, my child! I, even I, moi qui vous parle, need no information
about fear. When I was twelve years old, it was discovered that I had
defective kidneys; the opinion, nomine contradicente, of the Medical
Profession was that I could certainly never live to be twenty-one. (Some
people think that they were right!) But after a couple of years with
tutors in the wildest parts of the country, I was<br />
found well enough to go to a Public School. They soon found me out! This
kidney weakness causes depression and physical cowardice, and the other
boys were not sympathetic about kidneys, regarding them mostly as
satisfactory parts of the body to punch.<br />
Imagine my misery! The most powerful of all my passions—bar slothùis
Pride; and here was I, the object of universal contempt. So, when I was
able to determine my own way of life, I observed mildly “Pike’s Peak or
bust!” and chose for my sports the two, mountain climbing and big-game
shooting, reputed the most dangerous. It was a desperate remedy, but it
worked. No half measures, either! I used to wander into the jungle
alone, looking for tigers, and trusting to my sense of direction to take
me back to camp. All my mountain climbing was guideless, and a very
great deal of it solitary.<br />
Well, this is not an example for you to copy, is it? But it gives an
idea of the principle “Take the bull by the horns.” A practice easier to
imitate was this following. In most great cities, always in Eastern
cities, are black slums. Here one may find blind alleys, dark doorways
open to unlighted houses. One may explore such places, looking for
adventure—and it was rather a point of honour to accept the challenge in
whatever form it took. Again, one may walk with deliberate carelessness
into the traffic1; this practice does not in my considerable experience,
conduce to one’s personal popularity.<br />
Another idea was to hasten to cholera-stricken cities, to places where
Yellow Jack, plague, typhoid and typhus, dysentery (et hæc turba
malorum) were endemic; and (of course) big-game hunting takes one to the
certainty of malarial fever, with no doctors (or worse, Bengali
doctors!) within many a league.<br />
The general principle seems to be “This boat carries Caesar and his
Fortunes!” and no doubt Pride in its most Satanic degree is one’s
greatest asset. But the essence of the practice, as a practice, is to
seek out and to face what one fears. Do not forget that courage implies
fear—what else should fear be useful for?<br />
Of course, fears differ greatly both in quality and in degree; and one
must distinguish between rational fear, ignorance of which implies
stupidity, brutishness, imbecility, or what have you, and the
pathological fear which springs from mental or moral disorder. There are
in fact many types of fear which may be uprooted by some form of
psychoanalysis. Generally speaking, it is up to you to invent a practice
to meet each specific case.<br />
One moment, though, about the fear of death. The radical cure is the
gaining of the magical memory. (See also AL I, 58) The more previous
incarnations one can remember, the less important appears the moment
when the curve of life dips below the horizon. (One very curious point:
when one looks back at the moment of one of one’s deaths, one exclaims:
“By Jove! that was a narrow escape, and no mistake!” Escape from what?
Me no savvy; but such is the fact.) How to acquire that Memory? The
development of the Magical Record is by far the most important of one’s
weapons.<br />
How to use the Record is not easy to explain; but there is a sort of
knack which comes to one suddenly. And there are certain types of
Samadhi during the exercise of which these memories appear
spontaneously, without warning of any kind.<br />
There is comfort in the thought that the persistent practice of seeking
out one’s fears, analysing them and their causes, then deliberately
evoking them to “come out you cad and fight!” (W.S. Gilbert),<br />
presently sets up a habit of mind which is a strong fortress against all
fear’s modes of assault; one springs automatically to action when a
patrol sneaks up within range of one’s guns.<br />
Particularly useful against the fear of death is the punctual and
vigorous performance of Liber Resh.<br />
Meditate on the sun in each station: his continuous and even way: the
endless circle. That formula in the Tarot book is most valuable.<br />
One excellent practice, the general idea of which can easily be adapted
to a host of particular cases, is the use of the imagination.<br />
Let me tell you how it worked in those early Air Raids on London. First,
I looked at the question sensibly, taking the view that shelters and gas
masks were soothing syrup with an element of boobytrap in it.<br />
(J. B. S. Haldane in Spain, running to escape a bomb, found himself
racing towards the exact spot where it fell.) Let me tell you a fable
from the East. It is one of those incomparably sublime blossoms of the
Spirit of Islam, infinite depth of wisdom adorned with the most
exquisite and delicate wit.<br />
Contrast it with the poor thin propagandist stuff which passes for a
parable in the Gospels! There is hardly one to be found worth
remembering.<br />
Isaak ben Hiddekel was a Jew of Baghdad. Though not in his first or even
second youth, he was in such health, enjoyed such prosperity, and
commanded such universal respect and devotion that every moment of his
life was dear to him. Among his pleasures one of the chief was the
friendship of the aged Mohammed ibn Mahmed of Bassorah, reputed a sage
of no common stature, for (it was said) his piety had been rewarded with
such gifts as the power to communicate with Archangels, angels, the
Jinn, and even with Gabriel himself. However this may have been, he held
Isaak in very great esteem and affection.<br />
It was shortly after leaving his friend’s house after a short visit to
Baghdad that he met Death. “Good morning,” said the saint. “I do hope
you’re not going to Isaak’s, he is a very dear friend of mine.”<br />
No!” said Death, “not just now; but since you mention it, I shall be
with him at moonrise on the thirteenth of next month. Sorry he’s a
friend of yours; but no one knows better than you do that these things
can’t be helped.”<br />
Mohammed set off sadly for Bassorah. Indeed, as the days passed, the
incident preyed upon his mind, until at last he resolved to risk the
breach of professional confidence and warn his friend. He sent
accordingly a letter of condolence and farewell.<br />
But Isaak was a man of action. Prompt and stealthy, on the day appointed
he saddled his best horse and so passed through the silent streets of
the city in search of a refuge.<br />
That evening Mohammed was returning from prayer “Nowit asali fardh salat
al maghrab Allahu akbar” slowly and mournfully, when hardly halfway from
the mosque to his house who should he meet but Death!<br />
“Peace be with thee!” says Death. “And peace with thee,” replied the
sage. “But I did not expect to see thee here to-night; I thought you
were to meet my friend Isaak, and he’s in Baghdad.” “It wants an hour
yet of the time,” says Death briskly; “and he’s galloping hither as fast
as he can.”<br />
At least, don’t let the Gods have the laugh on you! Hello! Here’s the
Book of Lies again! What fun.<br />
Now I ring up POL 5410 and borrow the book and get the chapter we need
copied and—oh! With luck we shall get this space filled in a month or
two!</p>
<p>The Smoking Dog<br />
Each act of man is the twist and double of an hare.<br />
Love and Death are the greyhounds that course him.<br />
God bred the hounds and taketh His pleasure in the sport.<br />
This is the Comedy of Pan, that man should think he hunteth, while those
hounds hunt him.<br />
This is the Tragedy of Man, when facing Love and Death he turns to
bay.<br />
He is no more hare, but boar.<br />
There are no other comedies or tragedies.<br />
Cease then to be the mockery of God; in savagery of love and death live
thou and die!<br />
Thus shall His laughter be thrilled through with Ecstasy.</p>
<p>Very good! Now where were we? in the “blitz?” Oh, yes! No sense in
scuffling or slinking or skulking; so one decides to take no notice so
far as practical action is concerned.<br />
So, the noise making work rather difficult, one lies down in Shavasana
(the “CorpsePosition”—flat on the back, arms by sides, everything
relaxed) or the Templar (Sleep of Siloam2) position, which is that of
the Hanged Man in the Tarot. One then imagines a bomb dropping first in
one place, then in another; one imagines the damage, and what one then
has to do to counteract the new dangers— perhaps a wall of your house
has gone, and you must get clear before the roof falls in. And so
on—close the practice by a blockbuster hitting you accurately on the tip
of the nose.3 This must be done realistically enough to make you
actually afraid. But presently the fear wears off, and you get
interested in your various adventures after each explosion: ambulance
taking you to hospital, getting tools and digging out other people and
so as far as your imagination takes you. After that comes yet another
stage; your interest declines; you find yourself indifferent to the
entire proceedings. After a few nights you can no longer distinguish
between the real thing and your own private and peculiar Brock’s
Benefit. The fear will have vanished; familiarity breeds contempt.
Finally, one is no longer even aware that the boys are out again on a
lark.<br />
Incidentally, one may draw a quite close parallel between these four
stages and those accompanying Samadhi (probably listed in Mrs Rhys
David’s book on Buddhist Psychology, or in Warren’s bran-tub of
translations from the Tripitaka, or Three baskets of the Dhamma. I
haven’t seen either book for forty years or more, don’t remember the
exact titles; scholars would help us to dig them out, but it isn’t
worthwhile. I recall the quintessence accurately enough.<br />
Stage 1 is Ananda, usually translated “Bliss”. This is an intensity of
enjoyment altogether indescribable. This is due to the temporary
destruction of the pain-bearing Ahamkara, or Ego-making faculty.<br />
Stage 2. Ananda wears off sufficiently to allow one to observe the state
itself: intense interest (objective) of a kind that suggests approach to
the Trance of Wonder. (See Little Essays Towards Truth, pp. 24-28
).<br />
Stage 3. Interest exhausted, one just doesn’t care. (once more
“Indifference” Op. cit. pp. 39-44. How simple, how serene, how innocent
a pleasure to write Op. cit.! It does make one feel good!)<br />
Stage 4. “Neither indifference nor not-indifference.” One hardly knows
what to make of this translation of the technical Buddhist term:
probably no meaning is really illuminating to one who has not
experienced that state of mind. To me it seems a kind of non-awareness
which is somehow different from mere ignorance. Rather like one’s
feeling about the automatic functions of physiology, perhaps: and
acceptance so complete that, although the mind contains the idea, it is
not stirred thereby into consciousness. These speculations are, perhaps,
idle, and so distracting, for you in your present path. Was it
worthwhile to make this analogy? I think so, vague and unscientific as
it must have seemed to you, as reminding you of the way in which unlike
ideas acquire close kinship as one advance on the path.<br />
Enough of all this! I could not bear to hear you exclaim:<br />
“Di magni! Salaputtium disertum!” as Catullus would certainly have done,
had I inflicted all these dryas-dust dromedary-dropping upon him!<br />
Let us get on to your white rages!<br />
Well I do know them though I call them black—no, I shall not quarrel
about the colour.<br />
To me they come almost every day. When I see the maid dust my
mantelpiece—which I pay her to do—I want not merely to slay her in the
extremity of torment; I want to abolish her, to annihilate her—and the
mantelpiece too and everything on it! I can hardly keep from roaring at
her to get out and never darken my door again. This is not because she
is doing it badly; doing it at all is a token of the unspeakable horror
of existence. The actual feeling is that she is somewhat disturbing my
aura, which I had got so nice and clean and quiet after the nuisance of
“getting up.” I feel as if I were being pushed about in a crowd of
swarming insect-citizens.<br />
Then there is quite another kind, which is quite clearly penny-plain
frustration. Something one wants to do, perhaps a trifle, and one can’t.
Then one looks for the obstacle, and then the enemy behind that again;
maybe one gets into one of those “laddermeditations” (as described in
Liber Aleph,4 quoted in The Book of Thoth, when discussing “The Fool”
and Hashish, only the wrong way up!)<br />
which end by the conception of the Universe itself as the very climax,
asymptote, quintessence of frustration—the perfect symbol of all
uselessness. This is, of course, the absolute contradictory of Thelema;
but it is the sorites on which both Hindu and Buddhist conclusions are
based. This kind of rage is, accordingly, most noxious; it is direct
attack from within upon the virgin citadel of Self. It is high treason
to existence. Its results are immediately harmful; it begets depression,
melancholy, despair. In fact, one does wisely to take the bear by the
ring in his snout; accept his conclusions, agree that it is all abject
and futile and silly—and turn the hose-pipe of the Trance of Laughter on
him until he dances to your pleasure.<br />
But—is this any answer to your problem? It disturbs me little that you
should try to palm off “Peace” upon my sentries as the password. Too
often peace is merely the result of war-weariness, and the very negation
of victory. It is (or may be) the formula of sloth and the gateway of
stagnation.<br />
Life is to be a continuous vibration of ecstasy; and so it is for the
Adept, whenever his work allows him time to consider the matter,
consciously; and even when his work pre-empts his attention, is an
eternal fountain of pure joy springing, a crystal fragrance of
reverberation light from the most inmost caverns of the Heart. It
secretly informs one’s dullest thought with sparkling wine, radiant in
the Aethyr—see well! The least excuse, since it is always there and
champing at its bit, to turn the dreary cart-horse drudge into proud
Pegasus himself!<br />
This is where I want to have you, with us who are come thus far, in a
state utterly detached from the Ego, so that you appear the plain Jane
Wolfe5 “doing your duty in that state of life to which it has pleased
God to call you” and consequently unremarked—like a Rosicrucian,
“wearing the habit of the country in which you are travelling”—but
trembling with interior illumination, so that the first relaxation of
the constant conscious burden of Jane Wolfe, Soror Estai is
automatically released, a pillar of Creative Light.<br />
“I am Thou, and the Pillar is ’stablished in the Void.” (Liber LXV,as
you know, is full of these explosions).<br />
No: I am not at all sure that all this is the answer that you need about
white rages. Yet it is certainly contained herein, or, at the least,
implied. (Of course, it is all here, my love, and may God bless you,
where ever you are.)<br />
Try another aspect.<br />
We tracked the cause: it was frustration. Good: then we must counter it.
How? Only (in the last event) by getting the mind firmly fixed in the
complete philosophy of Thelema. There is no such thing as frustration.
Every step is a step on the Path. It is simply not true that you were
being baulked.<br />
The height of your irritation is a direct measure of the intensity of
your Energy. Again, you soon come to laugh at yourself for your
impatience. Probably (you surmise) your trouble is exactly that: you are
pushing too hard. Your mind runs back to AL I 44: you realise (again!)
that any result actually spoils the Truth and Beauty of the Act of Will;
it is almost a burden; even an insult. Rather as if I risked my life to
save yours, and you tipped me half-a-crown! Here’s that Book of Lies
popping out its ugly mug again: “Thou has become the Way.” This is why
the Ankh or “Key of Life” is a sandal-strap, borne in the hand of every
God as a mark of his Godhead: a God is one who goes. (If I remember
rightly, Plato derives “Te..” from a verb meaning “to run”, and is
heartily abused by scholars for so doing. But perhaps the dreary old
sophist was not far wrong, for once.) What you need to do, then, is to
knit all these ideas into a very close pattern; to make of them a
consecrated Talisman. Then, when rage takes you, it can be thrown upon
the fire to stifle it: to thrust against the Demon, to disintegrate
him.<br />
The great point is to have this weapon very firmly constructed, very
complete. Your rage will pass in one of those two ways, which are one:
Rapture and Laughter.<br />
I want you to go over this apparatus very carefully; to analyse the
argument, to make sure that there are no loose ends, to keep it keen and
polished and well-oiled, ever ready for immediate use: not only against
rage, but against any hampering or depressing line of thought.<br />
Well, let us hope that I’ve got it all down fairly well this time, and
that you will find it work. For I confess to a touch of my
Mariana-in-the-moated-Grange complex: I’ve been umpteen hours on this
letter, and I must have killed a Cakkravarti-Rajah, or wounded the body
of a Buddha, in my last incarnation, or Tahuti (hang it all! I have been
most devoted to him all my life) would have let me have a secretary.
Well, that’s that: so now to turn the Flak on to your so-called “Astral
Flight.” What a Tail spin! (Here I dash my turban to the ground! Here I
deliver you to Eblis, and reserve a private box for you in Jehannum!
Here I melt into salt tears, and think of all the other Gurus that have
had to bear it.)<br />
Astral Flight!!!!!!!!<br />
Excuse me if I mention it, but—no doubt the fault is mine—you seem to
have failed to note any single one of all my prayerful injunctions,
either in the letter or on your visit. Perhaps you thought that I should
take circles and pentagrams etc. for granted: but you give no hint of
the object of your journey. (No don’t quote AL I, 44 at me: it doesn’t
mean that. I don’t expect you to answer the clerk at the booking-office
“Where to, madam?” with “I don’t mind in the least.” Though, even in
that case it is magically true, or should be. As in the case of the
young lady who got carried on to Crewe. The unplanned adventure may have
proved much more amusing.) How am I to tell whether you were seeing
correctly? Suppose your chosen hexagram had been VI Sung “Contention” or
XXIX Î “Nourishing”? Where would be the “vision”? You are to set out to
explore a country unknown to you:<br />
How can I be sure that you have actually been there? How can you be sure
yourself? You can’t. You can, if you go to a place you have never heard
of, and then discover later on, that it actually exists.<br />
You have got to display the congruity of your vision with the account of
the country given in the Text.<br />
If you take Khien I, which is all Lingams and Dragons, and you describe
it as a landscape in the Broads, I can only conclude that you did not
get anywhere near it.<br />
Then you produce a monk, and never get his name or office. Finally after
you return, you get this Caballero dropping in unasked.<br />
Alas! I fear me much this was no Astral journey at all; it reads like
weak imagination tinged by desire.<br />
All you got of interest was the answer to your question: and that you
should have gripped, made more precise, analysed, interpreted. Dear me,
no!<br />
Final shot: my instinct is all against the “lying in bed.” These visions
are intensely active: the hardest kind of work. Read Liber CDXVIII, 2nd
Aethyr (and others) to understand the appalling physical strain, when
you reach remote, well-guarded, and exalted confines of the
Universe.<br />
In every sense of the expression—SIT UP!<br />
(I’m “sitting up” myself to finish this letter. Here goes for the last
lap!)<br />
Music. Justifiable? Why not? A help to your great Work, an aspect of
your Will, nicht wahr? Go to it!<br />
Apollo is the God of Music, pre-eminently; but He is too
all-comprehensive, all-pervading, to be much use in a Talisman except as
a general background. But there are the Muses: Polymina (or Polyhymnia)
seems the one you want: she inspires the sublime hymn. How to invoke her
is a matter for prolonged consideration. One would hardly see how to
tackle the problem at all, unless by digging out an Angel from one of
the Enochian Tablets. (See Equinox I, 7 and 8). Perhaps there is a
square<br />
ruled by Sol (or Venus), Fire, Air and Water in the Tablet of one of
these, with an appropriate Character on the summit of the Pyramid. If
so, all would be plain sailing.<br />
Of course, there are other Gods, notably Pan. (I must ask you to set my
Hymn to Pan to music). But I doubt if any of these are what you want.
Probably the most practical plan would be to make a musical conjuration
of Sol: use this as your invocation when you go on the Astral Plane:
there find a suitable guide to the proper authority—and so on!<br />
And that, dear Sister, for to-night will be exactly and precisely
that!</p>

2: The “sleep of Siloam” (or ‘Sialam’) appears to have been a term used
in certain occult fraternities to denote a controlled deliberate trance
state (according to the editors of The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor the
term originates in a 19th-century British army officer’s memoir of his
time in India, and was taken up by P.B. Randolph and H.P. Blavatsky). An
unpublished (possibly lost, or never written) official instruction of
A.’.A.’. supposedly deals with the matter. One ritual by Crowley which
mentions “the Sleep of Siloam” survives (it was published in The Magical
Link in 1999), and this does indeed have the magician lying down in the
Hanged Man posture at one point in the ritual – T.S.<br />

(Soror Fiat Yod) – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxiv-magical-power">Chapter LXIV: Magical Power</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Rightly you remark that most of these letters have dealt with
self-development in one form or another; now, what of the “causa
finalis”1, the “practical angle” some would call it. Are the outrageous
quack advertisements of the swindlers with their “Great Free Book” and
so on, all baseless? My dear child, then back to those letters that gave
you a glimpse of the History of Magick, and those in which I told you
something of the ways in which the Masters work. Oh, I see! What you
want now is to learn how to apply the knowledge and power that you have
gained to the execution of your True Will, to accomplishment of the
Great Work.<br />
Obviously, much must be left to your own common-sense; the one technical
point on which I insist above all others is the Magical Link.<br />
You must lay to heart Magick Chapter XIV (pp. 106-122) and never forget
one detail. More failure comes from neglect of this than from all other
causes put together. Most of the qualities that you need are inborn; all
the material is to your hand; and to develop them is a natural process,
equally your birth right. But the making of the Link is an intellectual,
even mechanical, task; success depends on purely objective
considerations.<br />
That granted, there are perhaps a few hints. Firstly, while of course
the Magical Theory supposes a kind of omnipotence, please remember that
Magick is Science, that the Laws of Nature remain the same, however
subtle may be the material with which one is working. It is, to put it
brutally, a bigger miracle to destroy a fortress than an easy
chair.<br />
You know this well enough; but the corollary is that it is nearly always
a mistake to try to do things entirely off one’s own bat. It is much
simpler to look for an existing force, in good working order, that is
doing the sort of stuff that you need, and take from it, or control in
it, just that bit of it that you happen to require.<br />
You can, theoretically, walk from Cadiz to Vladivostok; but unless there
be some special reason, it will save time and waste of energy to make
use of a fraction of the machine-power that happens to be moving in that
direction.<br />
This is particularly true of moral and political reform. Hitler would
have got exactly nowhere if he had been content to announce his evangel;
he became master of Germany, and, for a time, of nearly all Europe, by
playing upon existing instruments of human passion; the revenge-lust of
Central Europe, the panic of the Blimps and Junkers, the discontent of
the property-lacking classes, the pride and ambition of the Prussian
military clique, and so on. When he had used them to the full, he
callously flung them to the wolves. But make no mistake! The Magical
Power behind all his actions lay in himself. He had succeeded in making
himself a prophet, like Mohammed; even a symbol, like the Cross of the
His magical technique was indescribably admirable; he adopted the
Swastika, the Hammer of Thor, the distinctive dress, the slogan, the
gestures, the greeting; he even imposed a Sacred Book upon the people.
If that book had only been more mystic and incomprehensible, instead of
reasonable, diffuse, and intolerably dull, he might have done better. As
it was, he came within an ace of capturing England, even before he came
to power in Germany; and it was American money that saved the Nazi party
at the most critical moment. Cleverest move of all, he gave the world
something to hate; the Communist and the Jew.<br />
His only trouble was that he couldn’t count on his fingers! I perceive
that I am turning into the late Samuel Smiles; having given you an
example to imitate—but don’t forget your arithmetic!—let me initiate you
into one of two other secrets of power!<br />
Um—will I now? Perhaps you’re hardly grown up enough. I suspect that
your question contemplated not so much Power as powers: things like
healing the sick, making oneself invisible, kindling a flame with- out
combustibles, bewitching the neighbours’ cows, spoiling your friend’s
honeymoon, fascinations of all kinds, levitation, lycanthropy,
necromancy, all the regular stuff of the legends and<br />
the fables.<br />
Most of these matters are discussed in Magick, so all I need tell you is
the correct general attitude to all such thaumaturgies.<br />
The best excuse for trying to acquire them is that one learns such a lot
in the process. Otherwise—Here is another of those Eastern stories for
you! A certain Yogi thought it would be an admirable achievement to walk
across the Ganges. After forty years he succeeded, and went off to his
Guru to demonstrate his power, and receive his due meed of praise. It so
happened that this Guru was rather like myself, at least in the matter
of his Nasty Temper; and when the disciple came gaily striding back
across the Sacred Stream, expecting compliments, he was met with: “Well,
I think you’re a perfect fool all these years, your neighbours have been
going to and fro on a raft for a cup of rice!”<br />
The moral, dear child, is that such powers are never to be considered as
the main object; it ought in fact to be obvious from the start that any
one’s True Will must be deeper and more comprehensive than any mere
technical achievement. I will go further and say that any such endeavour
must be a magical mistake, like cherishing a gun or a clock or a
fishing-rod for its own sake, and not for the use that one can make of
it. Indeed, that remark goes to the root of the matter; for all these
powers, if we understand them properly, are natural by-products of one’s
real Great Work. My own experience was very convincing on this point;
for one power after another came popping up when it was least wanted,
and I saw at once that they represented so many leaks in my boat. They
argued imperfect insulation.<br />
And really they are quite a bit of a nuisance. Their possession is so
flattering, and their seduction so subtle. One understands at once why
all the first-class Teachers insist so sternly that the Siddhi (or
Iddhi) must be rejected firmly by the Aspirant, if he is not to be
sidetracked and ultimately lost.<br />
Nevertheless, “even the evil germs of Matter may alike become useful and
good” as Zoroaster reminds us.2 For one thing, their possession is
indubitably a sheet-anchor, at the mercy of the hurricane of Doubt—
doubt as to whether the whole business is not Tommy-rot!<br />
Such moments are frequent, even when one has advanced to a stage when
Doubt would seem impossible; until you get there, you can have no idea
how bad it is! Then, again, when these powers have sprung naturally and
spontaneously from the exercise of one’s proper faculties in the Great
Work, they ought to be a little more than leaks. You ought to be able to
organise and control them in such wise that they are of actual
assistance to you in taking the Next Step. After all, what moral or
magical difference is there between the power of digesting one’s food,
and that of transforming oneself into a hawk?<br />
That being the case, let me transform myself into a butterfly, and flit
on to other honeysuckles!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>

<p>1: Lat., “final cause.” Aristotelean and medieval philosophy
recognised four kinds of “cause” (a.t.a): material, formal, efficient
and final; the “final cause” is the “for the sake of which,” the purpose
an intelligent agent has when making or doing something, the end or goal
for which a thing exists, and so on – T.S.<br />
2: Chaldæan Oracles, fragment 191 in the Westcott edition, where it is
rendered “Nature persuadeth us that there are pure Dæmons, and that evil
germs of Matter may alike become useful and good.” A modern translation
(by Johnston in Hekate Soteira) runs “Physis persuades us to believe
that the daemones are pure, and that the products of evil matter are
propitious and good.” Johnston (also Lewy in Chaldæan Oracles and
Theurgy) interprets this verse in a manner almost diametrically opposed
to that of Crowley, arguing that the Oracles have a basically hylophobic
perspective and this fragment is rather a warning about the delusiveness
of “nature” (f.s..) – T.S.</p>

<p>In previous letters I hope I have been able to give you some idea of
the initiated conception of the Macrocosm, and also to have made it
clear to you why we must all use a symbolic language, and the necessity
of constructing a special alphabet as the basis of our conversations
about Magick.<br />
I have also furnished you with charts of this alphabet. It would of
course have been too clumsy and cumbersome to put all the different
systems of symbol on to the Tree of Life. That Tree is indeed the basis
of all our classification and I hope by now you have got fairly familiar
with the process of sticking everything that turns up on its correct
branch of the Tree.<br />
In your last letter you thank me for having made clear to you the
initiated teaching with regard to the Universe; and you now very rightly
enquire “this being so, where do we come in?” You hold up to me one of
the oldest axioms of the Qabalah. “That which is above is like that
which is below,” and you ask me for details. What, you enquire, is the
constitution of Man? With what parts of the Great System is the Little
System to coincide?<br />
Perhaps I could hardly do better than call your attention to the
description given in my essay on Man in my small book Little Essay
Toward Truth.<br />
In some respects indeed this description is not as clear as I could have
wished. The fact is that this Essay was written chiefly for the benefit
of those people who were already more or less familiar with the Tree of
Life and its correspondences. But I do not know even today, twenty years
later, and writing as I am to you who admittedly had no previous
knowledge of any of these subjects, how to set forth the facts in more
elementary terms. I warned you in the beginning that there was an
essential difficulty in these studies which is not to be by-passed or
dodged in any way whatever.<br />
But, after all, it is the same difficulty which every child finds when
he begins any study of any kind. In Latin, for instance, he is told that
mensa means a table, that it belongs to the first declension and is
feminine. There is no why about any of this; no explanation is possible;
the child has to pick up the elements of the language one by one, taking
what he is taught on trust. And it is only after accumulating a vast
collection of unintelligible details that the jig-saw pieces fall into
place, and he finds himself able to construe the classical texts.<br />
You must be patient; you must go over and over again everything that is
presented to you, and by obeying you will not only come to a clear
comprehension of the subject, but find yourself automatically thinking
in the language which you have been at such pains to acquire.<br />
I feel then that I must leave you with these descriptions and these
charts until painfully at first, but at the end with intense pride and
gratification, you find yourself spontaneously grasping the more complex
combinations of these letters and words which are the anatomy of the
body of our Learning.<br />
And do not forget the old and well-worn saw: “Drink deep, or taste not
the Pierian Spring!—A little learning is a dangerous thing.”</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>

<p>Note: In the original this letter was accompanied by four Tree of
Life diagrams, three of which were copies of those which appeared in The
Book of Thoth. They have been redrawn and in some cases re-arranged in
an attempt to make the information readable on a computer screen.</p>
<p>THE KEY SCALE<br />
This figure shows the Sephiroth with their numbers only and the Paths
with Hebrew letters corresponding. The first number on each Path is its
“key scale” number, the second is the numerical value of the letter.</p>
<p>HEBREW NAMES OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS.<br />
This figure shows the name of the Sephiroth and the letters of the Paths
in English, Hebrew and transliterated Hebrew. In the original edition
the information on this and the above were combined into a single
diagram which thus became unreadable in places.<br />
THE CHINESE COSMOS.<br />
This shows Crowley’s later attributions of the Taoist principles
including the eight trigrams of the Yi King to the Sephiroth. These
differ somewhat from those in 777 col. XLVI and Appendix I.<br />

<p>THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN</p>
<p>The figure on which this is based was probably a copy of the diagram
accompanying the first edition of Little Essays Toward Truth and shows
the A.’.A.’. grades on the Tree of Life along with the Four Worlds and
the Qabalistic Soul.1<br />
1: This duplicates the G.’.D.’. confusion of the parts of the soul with
the four Qabalistic worlds—as started by Mathers through
misinterpretation of traditional Qabalah. The error of omitting the
sixth traditional part, the Guff, is also perpetuated here. No big
issue, but I’m picky – WEH. The confusion<br />
between the Qabalistic worlds and parts of the soul first appears to
have been perpetrated by Mathers in his introduction to Kabbalah
Unveiled (s.72 and subjoined plate). The G’uph, identified with the
physical body, is mentioned in the account of the Qabalistic Soul in
Zalewski, Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxvi-vampires">Chapter LXVI: Vampires</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>So you want me to tell you all about Vampires? Vampire
yourself!<br />
I ask you, how does this come within the scope of your enquiries? Is
this information essential to your Accomplishment of the Great Work? As
the Government might say “Is your journey really necessary?”<br />
So musing, I rang you up for details. Vampires, you say, might be a
temptation to yourself, or they might sap your energy. Very good. I will
tell you the little I know.<br />
Listen to Eliphas Lévi! He warns us against a type of person, fearless
and cold-blooded, who seems to have the power to cast a sudden chill,
merely by entering the room, upon the gayest party ever assembled.<br />
Tête-à-tête, they shake one’s resolution, kill one’s enthusiasm,
devitalise one’s faith and courage.<br />
Yes, we all know such people. Mercury, by the way, is the planet
responsible. I have examined a considerable number of nativities, both
of murderers and of people murdered; in both cases it was not a
“malefic” that did the dirty work, but poor tiny innocent
silvery-shining Mercury!<br />
“Fie for same, you naughty planet!<br />
You’re the blighter that began it.”<br />
is it not John Henry Newman that sang of Lucifer? I doubt it.<br />
You, however, are thinking more of the vampire of romance. Bram Stoker’s
Dracula and its kindred.<br />
This is a splendidly well-documented book, by the way; he got his
“facts” and their legal and magical surroundings, perfectly
correct.<br />
It is easy enough to laugh at vampires if you live in Upper Tooting, or
Surbiton, or one of those places where no self-respecting Vampire would
wish to be seen. But in a lonely mountain village in Bulgaria you might
feel differently about it! You should remember, incidentally, that the
evidence for vampires is as strong as for pretty well anything else in
the world. There are innumerable records extant of legal proceedings
wherein the most sober, responsible, worthy and well-respected citizens,
including the advocates and judges, investigated case after case with
the utmost minuteness, with the most distinguished surgeons and
anatomists to swear to the clinical details.<br />
Endless is the list of well-attested cases of bodies dug up after months
of burial which have been found not merely flourishing with all the
lines of life, but gorged with fresh blood.<br />
I cannot help feeling that all the superior-person explanations—which
explain nothing—about collective hysteria and superstition and wish
fulfilment and the rest of the current tomfool jargon, are just about as
hard to believe as the original straight forward stories.<br />
The man who shook his head on being shown a giraffe, and said “I don’t
believe it,” is quite on a par with the pontifical wiseacres of Wimpole
Street.<br />
It is egomaniac vanity that prompts disbelief in phenomena merely
because they lie outside the infinitesimally minute pilule of one’s own
personal experience.<br />
When I crossed the Burma-China frontier for the first time, who should I
meet but our Consul at Tengyueh, the admirable Litton, who had by sheer
brains and personality turned the whole province of Yunnan into his own
Vice-royalty? We lunched together on the grass, and I hastened to dig
into the goldmine of his knowledge of the country. About the third or
fourth thing he said to me was this:<br />
“Remember! whatever anyone tells you about China is true.” No words have
ever impressed me more deeply; they sank right in and were illuminated
by daily experience until they had justified themselves a thousand times
over.<br />
That goes for Vampires!<br />
Oh yeah! (you vulgarly interpolate) and how does it go with the Master’s
unfathomably sage discourse on Doubt.<br />
Sister, you’re loopy! Sister, if I may doubt all the people who have
been to Africa or the Zoo and seen that giraffe, why must I cling with
simple childlike trust to the people that say they’ve been all over Hell
and parts of Kansas, and haven’t seen one, and therefore such things
cannot possibly be? Of the two dogmatic assertions, I should
unquestionably prefer the positive statement to the negative.<br />
In 1916, I was the first trained scientific observer to record the
appearance commonly called “St Elmo’s fire” indiscreetly revealing this
fact in a letter to the New York Times. I was pestered for the next six
months and more by professors of physics (and the rest) from all over
the U.S.A. The Existence of the phenomenon had been doubted until then
because of certain theoretical difficulties.<br />
That, sister, is the point. If a statement is hard to reconcile with the
whole body of evidence on the laws of the subject, it is rightly
received with suspicion.<br />
A moment with great Huxley, and his illustration of the centaur in
Piccadilly, reported to him (he humorously hypothesises) by Professor
Owen. What occasions Huxley’s doubt, and inspires the questions by means
of which he seeks to confirm or to discredit it? Just this, no more:
here is the head and torso of a man fitted to the shoulders of a horse;
how are the mechanical adjustments effected?<br />
In the same strain, he pointed out that for an angel to have practicable
wings as in Mediaeval pictures, the breast-bone would have to stand out
some five feet in front of the body. (The poor fellow, of course, was
densely ignorant of the mechanics of the Astral Plane. I am, for once,
“on the side of the angels.”)<br />
Am I digressing again? No, not really; I am just putting forward a case
for keeping an open mind on the subject of Vampires, even of the Clan
Dracula.<br />
But certainly there is little or no evidence of the existence of that
species in England.<br />
How then is the subject in any way important to you? Thus, that there
are actually people running about all over the place, who actually
possess, and exercise, faculties similar to those mentioned by Lévi, but
in much greater intensity, even of a kind far more formidable, and
directed by malignant will.<br />
There is a mighty volume of theory and practice concerning this and
cognate subjects which will be open to you when—and if—you attain the
VIII° of O.T.O. and become Pontiff and Epopt of the Illuminati. Further,
when you enter the Sanctuary of the Gnosis—oh boy! Or, more accurately,
oh girl!<br />
Not that the O.T.O. is a Young Ladies’ and Gentlemen’s Seminary for
Tuition in Vampirism,1 with a Chair (hardly suitable) for Werewolves,
and Beds of Justice—that sounds more apt—for Incubi and Succubi;2 far
from it! But the forces of Nature employed in these presumably
abominable practices are similar or identical.<br />
The doctrine of “Vital Force” has been so long and so completely
exploded that I hardly need to tell you that in some still undiscovered
(or, rather, unpublished) and unmeasured form it is certainly a fact.
Haven’t I told you one time how we nearly starved on Iztaccihuatl with
dozens of tinned foods all round us, they being ancient; of how one can
get drunk on half a dozen oysters; of how the best meat I have ever
eaten is half-raw Himalayan sheep, cut up and thrown on the glowing
ashes before rigor mortis had set in?3 There is a difference between
living and dead protoplasm, whether the chemist and his fellow
twilight-gropers admit it or no. I do not blame the ignorance of these
fumblers with frost-bitten fingers; but they make themselves
conspicuously asinine when they flaunt that ignorance as the
Quintessence of Knowledge; Boeotian bombast!<br />
There are forms of Energy, their Order too subtle to have been properly
measured hitherto, which underlie and can, within certain limits, direct
the gross chemical and physical changes of the body. To deny this is to
be flung headlong into the arms of Animal Automatism. Huxley’s arguments
for this theory are precisely like those of Bishop Berkeley:
unanswerable, but unconvincing. This letter is not, to every comma, the
ineluctable, apodictic, automatic, reaction to the stimulus of your
question; and no one can persuade me that it is. Of course that
unpersuadability is equally a factor in the equation; it is quite
useless to try to “answer back.” Only, it’s silly!<br />
(And, in the meanwhile, the mathematical physicists are knocking the
bottom clean out of their ship by shewing that causality itself is
little more than a maniac’s raving!)<br />
For all that, they move without flapping them. As Swinburne says: “Swift
without feet, and flying without wings.”4 So then, we may—at least!—get
busy. It is easy enough to bore one’s neighbour—look how I bore you! But
that is usually an unintentional business. Is it possible to intensify
the devitalising process, so as to weaken the victim physically, perhaps
even almost to the point of death?<br />
Yes.<br />
How? The traditional method is to get possession of some object or
substance intimately connected with the victim. On this you work
magically so as to absorb its virtue. It is best if it was as recently
as possible part of his living tissue; for instance, a nail-paring, a
hair plucked from his head.<br />
Something still alive or nearly so, and still part of the complex of
energies that he included in his conception of his body.<br />
Best of all are fluids and secretions, notably blood and one other of
supreme importance to the continuity of life. When you can get these
still alive to their function, it is best of all. That is why it is not
so highly recommended to tear out and devour the heart and liver of your
next-door neighbour; you have gone far to destroy just that which is of
most importance to you to keep alive.<br />
Doubtless you will reply with some apparent justice, indeed most
plausible is such ratiocination, that by taking into your own body, and
so preserving the life of, his heart and liver, the whole of his “vital
energies” will desert the sinking ship of the physical tissue, and rush
to the lifeboat provided by the vampire. Never forget that you confer an
inestimable benefit upon the victim by absorbing his lower point of
Energy into your higher. Read your Magick, Chapter XII!5<br />
You say this strongly, my dear Sister in the Lord; your thesis is
impeccably stated, your arguments are cogent, plangent, not to be
repeated. But—this I put to you most solemnly—what experimental evidence
do you adduce? How many hearts, how many livers, have been your
spiritual sustenance?<br />
Have you excluded every source of error? Have you—here, you know the
routine; write it all down and send it along to be vetted!<br />
Be that as it may, I once knew a lady of some seventy summers. She came
of a noble Polish family; she was short, sturdy, rather plump but
singularly agile; good-looking in a brutal sort of way. But—her eyes!
For fifty years she had lived nearly all the year round in her chateau
in Touraine. She had plenty of money, and had always surrounded herself
with a dozen or more boys and young men. (By<br />
young I mean up to forty). She not only looked twenty-five but she lived
twenty-five. It was a genuine, natural, spontaneous twenty-five, not a
gallant effort. She would dance the night through and go a long walk in
the morning. You may apply to her for details of the treatment; I dare
say she is still about, thought I did hear that she moved to South
America when she saw 1914 coming. In any case, you have had some fairly
plain hints so I can say in all simplicity, “Go thou and do
likewise!”<br />
I think my old friend Claude Farrère had more than an inkling of these
matters; the idea of using young cellular tissue to fortify the old is
plainly stated in La maison des hommes vivants; but as to the method of
transmission his water was drawn from Wells (H.G.)<br />
After that—you will agree that I have written enough.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-lxvii-faith">Chapter LXVII: Faith</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Dear me! dear me! this is very unexpected. I wrote you a long while
ago about doubt, and now I suppose the seed fell in fertile ground! My
chaste remarks have prompted a new question “arising out of the previous
answer, Sir.”<br />
You point out quite correctly that the doubt of which I wrote in
passages of such burning eloquence is after all what used to be called
“philosophic” doubt; and by “philosophic” people apparently meant
something rather like “Pickwickians.”<br />
Not the genuine McCoy, determining action, but—well, rather like scoring
points in an intellectual game.<br />
Now then (air connu) what is Faith? There are two kinds; and they are
almost exact opposites. (N.B. The word is allied to Bide: there’s some
idea of endurance (or perhaps repose) in it. Cf Peter!?!?!?)<br />
Then the third kind, which is moral, not intellectual; as in “good
faith,” bona fide, yours faithfully; and this is probably the hallmarked
sense, for it implies just that endurance which goes with bide, and is
not dependent in any way upon reason or conviction. This then I may
dismiss as impertinent to the question in your letter, and stick to the
other two.<br />
Faith in its Meaning Number One was perfectly well defined by the
schoolboy: “the faculty of believing that which we know to be untrue.”
It is at least the acceptance of any statement as true without
criticism, examination, verification, or any other method of test. Faith
of this sort is evidently the main symptom of the moron, the half-wit,
the village idiot. It is this kind of faith upon the possession and
exercise of which religious persons always insist as the first condition
of salvation.<br />
Here is my own lamentable foresight on the subject!</p>
<p>The Convert (A Hundred Years Hence)1<br />
There met one eve in a sylan glade<br />
A horrible Man and a beautiful maid.<br />
“Where are you going, so meek and holy?”<br />
“I’m going to temple to worship Crowley.”<br />
“Crowley is God, then? How did you know?”<br />
“Why, it’s Captain Fuller that told us so.”<br />
“And how do you know that Fuller was right?”<br />
“I’m afraid you’re a wicked man; Good-night.”<br />
While this sort of thing is styled success<br />
I shall not count failure bitterness.</p>
<p>Sometimes, note well! they are even frank about it, and say plainly
that there would be no merit in it if there were any reasonable basis
for it! This position is at the worst both honest and intelligible; the
only trouble is that there is no possible means of deciding which to two
conflicting statements to accept.<br />
In faith of this kind there are of course in practice delicately shaded
degrees; these depend mostly upon the authority of the speaker and your
relations with, and opinion of, him. In practice, moreover, faith is
usually tinged—should I say clouded?—by questions of probability. I see
no need to weary you with examples of varying degrees; it is enough to
dismiss the subject with the remark that faith is not true faith if any
considerations of any kind sully its virgin nullity.<br />
To prop faith is to destroy it: I am reminded of Mr Harry Price’s young
lady of Brocken fame, who was so timorously careful of her virginity
that she never felt it safe unless she had a man in bed with her.<br />
What is the other kind of faith? Like its hostile twin, it must have no
truck with reason, at least no conscious truck, or it ceases to possess
a moral meaning. It is that confidence in oneself which assures one that
the long shot at the tiger will fly true to the mark, that the tricky
putt will go down, that the man one never beat before will go down this
time; also its horrid contrary, the moral certainty that something will
go wrong, even with the easiest problems, with one hundred to one in
one’s favour.<br />
I think the official answer is that one’s certainty is in reality based
upon subconscious calculation, so that faith has nothing whatever to do
with it. If there is any answer to this, I don’t know it.<br />
After all, that is neither here nor there; there is but one material
issue: how to acquire that kind of faith. Suppose we hunt it up in that
precious Book of Lies! Any luck? Sure, kiddums, here we are!</p>
<p>Steeped Horsehair<br />
Mind is a disease of semen.<br />
All that a man is or may be is hidden therein<br />
Bodily functions are parts of the machine; silent, unless in
dis-ease.<br />
But mind, never at ease, creaketh “I.”<br />
This I persisteth not, posteth not through generations, changeth
momently, finally is dead.<br />
Therefore is man only himself when lost to himself in The
Charioting.</p>
<p>Nothing in that to contradict the official view, is there? Nothing in
biology either.</p>
<p>Or in Blake:<br />
“If the Sun and Moon should doubt They’d immediately go out.”<br />
Or in that other chapter of the Book of Lies:</p>
<p>The Mountaineer<br />
Consciousness is a symptom of disease.<br />
All that moves well moves without will.<br />
All skilfullness, all strain, all intention is contrary to ease.<br />
Practise a thousand times, and it becomes difficult; a thousand,
thousand, and it becomes easy; a thousand, thousand times a thousand,
thousand, and it is no longer Thou that doeth it, but It that doeth
itself through thee. Not until then is that which is done well
done.<br />
Thus spoke FRATER PERDURABO as he leapt from rock to rock of the moraine
without ever casting his eyes upon the ground.</p>
<p>Or in The Book of the Law. You know the passage well enough.<br />
Conclusion: this discussion has for ever abolished the use of the word
faith to imply conscious belief of any sort.<br />
At least, if there should ever be an element of awareness, it is of the
nature of a sudden leap into daylight of the quintessence of a mass of
subconsciously selected and ordered experience.<br />
Then what, if you please, did Paul mean when he wrote “Faith is the
substance of things hoped-for, the evidence of things unseen.” Oh, spot
the Lady!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours etc.</p>
<p>P.S. Don’t take any wooden money.<br />
P.P.S. I have a marvellous proposition for you; I wouldn’t let in anyone
on it but my very best friend: there’s a man in San Luis Potosi in a
mine there; he stole about $20,000 worth of gold dust and now he’s
afraid to get rid of it, but he knows I’m safe and knows how to handle
it and I’ve been his very best friend for twenty years, and he’s as
straight as a die, and I know he’d let us have it for $10,000 and I’ve
only got $4,000—and that is where you come in!<br />
“Confidence” = cum, with; fidere, to trust = to trust fully. This
confidence of which I write is usually a sort of “hunch”.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-lxviii-the-god-letters">Chapter LXVIII: The
God-Letters</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Maybe it was Devanagri that began it! This “sacred” character, used
rightly for Sanskrit alone, is supposed (so Allan Bennett told me) to be
constructed on—can one call them ideographic?—principles. The upright
line is the soft palate; the horizontal the hard; and the line between
them shows the position of the tongue when one pronounces the letter. He
demonstrated this most elegantly for the letter T ( ); but I was never
able to follow this up with most of the other fifty-five (isn’t it?)
letters.<br />
However, it did start me thinking (why?) about the possibility of a
direct relation between the sound of a letter and its meaning in some
primitive manner of speech.<br />
So I used to alarm my fellow-citizens, usually passengers on a liner, by
spending most of my time repeating some unhappy letter over and over,
while I looked into my mind to see if the sound suggested any particular
idea. (It was rather fun, you know; but it was most certainly one of the
most delicate, subtle, and difficult experiments that I have ever
undertaken.)<br />
Bound to flop, obviously, from the word “gun”, if only because the
same-sounding word in different languages—sometimes even in the
same!—has often not merely diverse, but diametrically opposed meanings.
Think of Bog, or Bug, the Russian word for God (I do think “Bogey” comes
from this, though!); think of the dam of a stream, and of a young thing,
and damn. Think of all the different kinds of box and cock and rock. (G.
K. Chesterton must have made tens of thousands of pounds out of it!)
Think of “let”, meaning both to prevent and to allow. Think of “check”
to a chess-player, a banker, a draper, a waitress, a fox-hunter and a
Slovak!<br />
The importance of all this: I’m sure I’ve told you how Thoth, God of all
Magick, the Wisdom and the Word, is usually shown with style and
papyrus, as inventor of writing, which is the real Magical Art.<br />
Hence “grimoire” is nothing but grammar; to cast a “spell” explains
itself; and the Angel (e.g. of a Church, see Revelations I, II) was
merely the Secretary.1<br />
Never mind! I was thinking of language in its (supposed) primal state,
when grunts and groans and moans and yells and squeaks and the like were
the nearest anybody ever got to:</p>
<p>“Sweet articulate words<br />
Sweetly divided apart.”</p>
<p>And yet I persisted. I wanted to go right back, before letters were
put together to make words at all.<br />
This is, I believe, almost wholly original work, though I’m not sure
that Fabre d’Olivet didn’t skate round the edges. I put to myself this
question: when I pronounce the letter so-and-so, what thought or class
of thought tends to arise in my mind? (If you practise this in public,
people may wonder!)<br />
With the vowels, one does seem to find a natural correspondence. (I
wrote a ballet “The Blind Prophet” on these lines, long before it struck
me to investigate on scientific lines).<br />
The Hindus knew this with their A-U-M: A is the open breath, U the
controlled force, M no breath at all. (See Magick, pp. 45-49). To me I
is a shrill feminine sound, as O is the roar of the male. U is pursed, E
hardly significant.<br />
As to Magick, the Gnostics were chili con carne plus molten platinum
plus a few girls I have known on the vowels. Their incantations consist
almost entirely of combinations of these.2 Seven at a time is very
frequent; in fact it seems sometimes as if their Theurgy depended on
variations of these combinations. Their theology, too. Never mind that
just now!<br />
But the consonants? That is a harder nut to crack.<br />
Students of language have been accustomed to group the consonants
exactly as we now happen to require. Here, in brief, is the list:<br />
Dentals, Labials, Gutturals.<br />
Various modifications extend them to fifty-nine and there are twenty-
seven vowels. I shall naturally concern myself only with those that
matter to the subject: in practice, the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew
Alphabet will serve for this preliminary study, especially as in that
case, we have already the attributions. I will begin by classing
them.3<br />
Gutturals</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>G. Luna.<br />
</li>
<li>Ch. Cancer, house of Luna; Jupiter here exalted.<br />
</li>
<li>K. Jupiter.<br />
</li>
<li>Q. Pisces, house of Jupiter. Atu XVII “The Moon.” You will note that
either Jupiter or Luna occurs in every case; in two, doubly. Guttur,
moreover, is the Latin word for throat. Both planets emphasise the soft
open expansive aspects of Nature; they both refer accordingly to the
feminine throat, the tube either of present or of future Life. (Jupiter,
when in Sagittarius, has an aggressive, masterful, male side; but his
letter when there is Samekh.) Now pronounce these letters; observe the
motions of opening and expulsion of the breath. Well, then, you will no
longer wonder at that list we had in another letter of the words Cwm,
coombe, quean, queen, and so on; also (?) quill, queer, quaintest,
curious, (?) quick, (?) quince: especially with the U vowel, which
sounds prehensile, ready to suck.<br />
Kupris (or Ctytto) the Greek or Syrian Aphrodite-Venus, is the
outstanding example in Theogony.<br />
But, you ask, what has all this to do with the Gods? Patience, child;
this will develop as we proceed. Let us look at the dentals. These, for
the profane scholar, include the “sibilants,” and “liquids.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Dentals:<br />
1. D. Venus.<br />
2. Z. Gemini, house of Mercury.<br />
3. T. Leo, house of Sol.<br />
4. L. Libra, house of Venus; Saturn here exalted.<br />
5. M. Water.<br />
6. N. Scorpio, house of Mars.<br />
7. S. Sagittarius, house of Jupiter.<br />
8. R. Sol.<br />
9. Sh. Fire.<br />
10. Th. Saturn; the Earth. Here, we see at one glance, there is no such
simple obvious relationship, as in the previous list. Nor indeed is
there, to my ear, any close connection in the sounds. Better luck,
perhaps, with the last lot.</p>
<p>Labials<br />
1. B. Mercury.<br />
2. V. (or F 4) Taurus. House of Venus; Luna exalted therein.<br />
3. P. Mars. Not a bit of it; almost worse than before. Here, then, I say
it, weeping, with agonised reluctance, the Holy Qabalah has let us down
with a bump! (It did look, too, didn’t it, as if it was all going to go
so miraculously well!) All is not lost—not even honour! Suppose you
reflect that (after all) Hebrew is a late language, invented; far, far
removed from the primitive grunts and groans (with their corresponding
motions) that we set out to study. Let us take the high hand, and say
that the Guttural Correspondence doesn’t rime with anything, that it is
just an amazing piece of sheer luck:<br />
nay, that it should serve us as a warning not to be led away like
Macbeth—you remember how</p>
<p>Banquo warned him that<br />
“Oftentimes, to win us to our harms,<br />
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,<br />
Win us with honest trifles, to betray us<br />
in deepest consequence.”<br />
—and breaks off abruptly to speak with his cousins.</p>
<p>Never forget the abiding temptation of men of science, the hidden
rocks on which so many have been wrecked, to generalise on insufficient
data. May the gods keep us from that! I dread it more than all the other
snags put together.<br />
With all due caution, therefore, let us attack our puzzle from the other
end; let us see what astral experiment tells us about the philology of
it!<br />
Good! We’ll call it D-Day and drop our paratroops. D is a sharp, sudden,
forceful explosive sound, cut off smartly. Now then I can’t tell whether
you will connect this with ejaculation, with the idea of paternity.
Whether or not, a vast number of people did so in the dawn of speech.
Even today children seem instinctively to say “Dad” for “Father,” though
no allowance can be made for cases of mistaken identity. And the most
ancient Father-Gods of the oldest and simplest civilisations are thus
named. In Sumer He was AD, or ADAD, whence the later Egyptian Hadit, and
the Semitic Adonai.<br />
(There are also words like AVD, the creative Magick). So also the Greeks
in Syria knew Adonis, and the Latin Deus is itself the general word for
God. Again, Valhalla houses Odin, Woden; and there are others. When the
dental is complicated to a sibilant, as we shall see later, another idea
is introduced; while the lightening of the sound to T has yet another
effect.<br />
Sanskrit also helps us with such roots as DETH, to show, DAM, to tame,
DEVK, to lead, DHEIGH, to knead, mould, DHER, to support, DO, to give,
DHE, to put and a while group of words like Deva, a divine being.<br />
But that comes later: meanwhile, practise pronouncing these names, as
also English words such as Do, Deed, Dare, Drive, Doubt, Dig, Dog, Dive,
Duck, Dub while exploring the Abyss of your mind, and see whether you do
not soon associate the D-sound with a swift, hard, definite, fertile and
completed act. For a fair test, take only the oldest and simplest words,
words which might naturally be wanted in the Stone Age.<br />
The next sound-group to be considered may conveniently be N. Here at
once we have innumberable Gods and Goddesses flocking up: Nu, Nuit, Ann,
Noah, John, Oannes, On, Jonah, et al. With the exception of On, a
special case, all these divine or semi-divine Beings refer to the Night,
the Starry Heavens, the Element of Water, the North, the Mother-Goddess,
as appears when we consider their legends and rituals. N, Nun, means a
fish and refers to the water sign of Scorpio. (Note, later when we reach
Sh, that Joshua was the Son of Nun.) To me the sound gives the idea of a
continuum, an eternal movement; and this is of course our Thelemic
conception of the Universe, the “Star-sponge,” of which I have elsewhere
written at such length.<br />
But at the moment I am especially desirous that you should compare and
contrast this letter with the S Sound. (S or Sh combined with T is
discussed rather fully in Magick, pp. 336-8)5 You should find it child’s
play to determine the significance of the sibilant. It is the one letter
which necessitates the exposure of the skeleton! (i.e., the
Subconscious). Hence “Hush!” it is the hiss of the snake, great Lord of
Life and Death—(life? yes, the spermatozoon, child!) “Silence! Danger!
There is a man somewhere about.” The savage reaction. And, sure enough,
Ish is the Hebrew for man (Mankind is ADM, Adam, Sanskrit Admi, the
Father and Mother conjoined. “Male and Female created They Man.”)<br />
The S-gods are innumerable. Asar (Asi, Isis, is his female twin)
Astarte, Ishtar or Ashtoreth, Set, Saturn, Shu, Zeus, (into whom the D
intrudes, because S is the male as N the female, and D the father as M
the mother) and the Jesus group. Here is the idea of the South, or East,
both quarters referring, in ways very slightly divergent, to the element
of Fire, the Sun, the Father-God in his aspect as the Holy Ghost. The
ancient tradition appears in the Gospels: the Lesser Mysteries of John,
beheaded with the Sword, and consumed on a Disk, and the Greater
Mysteries of Jesus, pierced with a Wand, and consumed in a Cup. All same
Tarot!<br />
I am not at all sure how far it is wise to take this letter. To make it
complete, we should need a Book about three times the size of The Book
of Thoth, and I should want another half-century of research before I
started to write it! As this seems for divers reasons a little awkward
in practice, I am rather afraid that we must content ourselves with this
very sketchy account: always, when one touches the subject, one “goes
all woolly.” One lacks not only completeness, but precision. Then there
is the “over-lapping” nuisance, and the fact that the natures and the
names of the Gods change slowly as time goes by. The confusion! The
contradictions! I could wish to be the proverbial bargee. Oh! I could go
on making excuses for another hour!<br />
I can’t be helped; and I feel that I shall have rendered you quite a bit
of service by calling your attention to the existence of the subject, by
stimulating you to research, by suggesting certain potential lines on
which to attack the same, and perhaps even by giving you a few tips
which you may find useful in practical Magick.<br />
The subject is closely bound up with Mantra-Yoga, and with Invocation.
You will doubtless have noticed (for instance) that many chapters of the
Q’uran have the letter L for a leit-motif. Islam attaches immense
importance to this liquid L, as it appears in Allah (compare the Hebrew
L-Gods, AL, Aloah, Elohim, A’alion, etc., and look up the L-idea in your
Book of Thoth, and in Magick, pp. 331 sqq.6) and other peculiarly sacred
names and words.<br />
Before cursing my way to dinner—oh! how I hate the need of food unless I
am practising the “Ninth Art” and disguise myself as a gourmet—I must
mention the letter M. This is the only letter that can be pronounced
with the lips firmly closed; it is the beginning of speech, and so the
Mother of the Alphabet. (Distinguish from N, the letter of the Female).
Look up Magick again; Chapter VII (pp. 45- 49) gives a good account of M
in discussing AUM. Note, too, the root MU “to be silent,” form which we
have the words Mystic, Mystery and others. As the letter of the Mother
it appears to this day in nature everywhere, the first call of the child
to “Mamma.” In nearly every language, moreover, the word for Mother is
based on M. Madar, Mere, Mutter, Umm, AMA or AIMA and the rest.<br />
The vibrant R suggests light-rays: Ra, the Sun; the labials bring to
mind the curves in Nature you will soon discover the words with a few
little experiments; the T is a D, only lighter, quicker and younger—and
so Good-night!</p>

<h3 id="chapter-lxix-original-sin">Chapter LXIX: Original Sin</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>It was at Dover. I had passed the Customs Inspector. Turning back, I
said: “But perhaps I ought to have declared my Browning?” Much agitated,
he muttered: “How ever did I come to miss that?” and began all over
again. I helped him out: “You see, you were thinking of pistols, I of
poetry.” (There is a lesson in that!)<br />
And now you—of all people!—fire him off at me. “Gold Hair” you write;
“what about R.B’s defence of Christianity?” You mean, of course,</p>
<p>“’Tis the faith that launched point-blank its dart<br />
At the head of a lie, taught Original Sin, The corruption of man’s
heart.”</p>
<p>It is impossible to commit all the possible logical errors in the
course of a single syllogism; but he has an honest try.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s not a man’s heart, but a girl’s.<br />
</li>
<li>He argues from an extravagantly rose case of aberration as if it
were an universal rule.<br />
</li>
<li>All his premises are false; and even at that, defective.<br />
</li>
<li>Non distributio medii.<br />
</li>
<li>Ignoratio elenchi.<br />
</li>
<li>Need I go on?</li>
</ol>
<p>For one thing, I have yet to learn who told the “lie.” It was not
until Rousseau that we had the nonsense about the “noble savage.” But it
is at least true that man’s deepest instincts, being natural and
necessary, are, for him, “right.” It is true that an artificial society
creates artificial crimes; but this is not “Original” Sin; on the
contrary. What’s that you say?<br />
I laugh! I wondered when you were going to pull me up, and send me
packing to my Skeat about what “Sin” means. O.K. Police routine does
beat the gifted amateur. Sin, astonishingly, means real!<br />
Curtius tells us “Language regards the guilty man as the man who it
was.” Then, what is “guilt”? A.S. gylt, trespass; in our own Thelemic
language, “deviation from (especially in the matter of excess,
trespasser) the True Will.” Please take notice that most of the words
which denote misconduct imply wandering, either from the home or from
the path: error, debauch, wrong (=twisted), wry, evil (excessive)
detraquer, go astray, and several others. So I too leap into the breach
with Curtius, and point out that “Language itself asserts the doctrine
of the True Will.” But what says The Book of the Law? It is at pains to
define Sin in plain terms: “The word of Sin is Restriction. …” (AL I,
41). From<br />
the context it seems clear that this refers more especially to
interference with the will of another.<br />
This statement is the first need of the world to-day for we are plagued
with Meddlesome Matties, male and female, whose one overmastering
passion is to mind other peoples’ business. They can think of nothing
but “control.” They aim at an Ethic like that of the convict Prison; at
a civilisation like that of the Bees or the Termites. But neither
history nor biology acquaint us with any form of progress achieved by
any of these communities. Penal settlements and Pall Mall Clubs have not
even made provision for the perpetuation of their species; and all such
“well-ordered” establishments are quite evidently defenceless against
any serious change in their environment. They have failed to comply with
the first requirements of biology; at best, they stagnate, they achieve
nothing, they never “get anywhere.”<br />
A settled society is useful at certain periods; when, for instance, it
is advisable to consolidate the gains gotten by pioneer adventurers; but
history shows with appalling clarity that the very qualities which serve
to protect must inevitably destroy the very conditions which they aim to
preserve.<br />
Hey! Hasn’t the dear old Book of Lies got its word on the subject? Never
known to fail!</p>
<p>The Wound of Amfortas<br />
The Self-mastery of Percivale became the Self-Masturbatery of the
Bourgeois.<br />
Vir-tus has become “virtue.”<br />
The qualities which have made a man, a race, a city, a caste, must be
thrown off; death is the penalty of failure. As it is written: In the
hour of success sacrifice that which is dearest to thee unto the
Infernal gods!<br />
The Englishmen lives upon the excrement of his forefathers.<br />
All moral codes are worthless in themselves; yet in every new code there
is hope. Provided always that the code is not changed because it is too
hard but because it is fulfilled.<br />
The dead dog floats with the stream; in puritan France the best women
are harlots; in vicious England the best women are virgins.<br />
If only the Archbishop of Canterbury were to go naked in the streets and
beg his bread!<br />
The new Christ, like the old, is the friend of publicans and sinners;
because his nature is ascetic.<br />
O if everyman did No Matter What, provided that it is the one thing that
he will not and cannot do.<br />
That settles it.</p>
<p>We do progress; but how? Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not
by the crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which
hamstring the racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations
of the eccentric, by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of
philosophy, by the aspirations of the idealist to the impossible, by the
imagination of the revolutionary, by the perilous adventure of the
pioneer. Progress is by leaps and bounds, but breaking from custom, by
working on untried experiments; in short, by the follies and crimes of
men of genius, only recognisable as wisdom and virtue after they have
been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly the harvest
of the seeds they sowed at midnight.<br />
Damn it! All this is so trite that I am half ashamed to write it; and
yet—everyone acquiesces with a smile, and goes off to vote another set
of fetters for his feet!<br />
Sin? This is the sin of sins: Restriction. All boots from the one last:
all beautifully polished on parade; the March of Time will find not much
but hobbling!<br />

this over) about Education.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. On reading this, I note that I passed over with deserved
contempt the theory of “original sin” in the sense which you probably
meant me to take: the defect deliberately implanted in man by “Old
Nobodaddy” with no better object than to prepare the grotesquely tragic
farce of the “Atonement.” I will merely remark that no idea at once so
base and so contemptible, so bestial and so idiotic, can challenge its
ignoble absurdity. Rotten with sex-perversion, it is a noisome blend of
sadism and masochism based on the most abject form of fear.<br />
The only argument for it is that it ever did exist; but it does not
exist for wholesome minds.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxx-morality-1">Chapter LXX: Morality (1)</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>“Tu l’as voulu, Georges Dandin!” I knew from the first that your sly,
insidious, poisoned poniard, slipped in between my ribs, would soon or
late involve a complete exposition of the whole subject of
Morality.<br />
Of we go! What really is it? The word comes from Mos, Latin for custom,
manner. Similarly, ethics: from Greek .T.S, custom. “It isn’t done” may
be modern slang, but it’s correct. Interesting to study the usage of
“moeurs” and “manières” in French. “Manner” from “manus”—hand: it is
“the way to handle things.”<br />
But the theological conception has steered a very wrong course, even for
theology; brought in Divine Injunction, and Conscience, and a whole host
of bogeys. (Candles in hollow turnips deceive nobody outside a
churchyard!)<br />
So we find ourselves discussing a “palely wandering” phantom idea whose
connotations or extensions depend on the time, the place, and the
victim. We know “the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban,” and the
difference between Old and New Testament morality in such matters as
polygamy and diet; while the fur flies when two learned professors go
down with a smart attack of Odium Theologicum, and are ready to destroy
a civilisation on the question of whether it is right or wrong for a
priest (or presbyter? or minister?) to wear a white nightie or a black
in the pulpit.<br />
But what you want to know is the difference between (a) common or area
morality, (b) Yogin—or “holy man’s” morality, and (c) the Magical
Morality of the New Aeon of Thelema.<br />
1. Area Morality: This is the code of the “Slave-Gods,” very thorougly
analysed, pulverised, and deloused by Nietzsche in Antichrist. It
consists of all the meanest vices, especially envy, cowardice, cruelty
and greed: all based on over-mastering Fear. Fear of the nightmare type.
With this incubus, the rich and powerful have devised an engine to keep
down the poor and the weak. They are lavish alike with threats and
promises in Ogre Bogey’s Castle and Cloud-Cuckoo-Land. “Religion is the
opium of the people,” when they flinch no longer from the phantom
knout.<br />
2. Eight Lectures on Yoga gives a reasonable account of the essence of
this matter, especially in the talks on Yama and Niyama. (A book on this
subject might well include a few quotations, notably from paragraphs 8,
9 and 10 in the former). It might be summarised as “doing that, and only
that, which facilitates the task in hand.” A line of conduct becomes a
custom when experience has shown that to follow it makes for success.
“Don’t press!” “Play with a straight bat!” “Don’t draw to five!” do not
involve abstract considerations of right and wrong. Orthodox Hinduism
has raped this pure system, and begotten a bastard code which reeks of
religion. A political manoeuvre of the Brahmin caste.<br />
Suppose we relax a little, come down to earth, and look at what the
far-famed morality of the Holy Man was, and is, in actual practice. You
will find this useful to crush Toshophist and Antroposophagist1
cockroaches as well as the ordinary Christian Scolex when they assail
you.<br />
In the lands of Hinduism and (to a less extent) of Islam, the Sultan,
the Dewan, the Maharajah, the Emir, or whatsoever they call “the Grand
Pandjandrum Himself, with the little round button on top,” it is almost
a 100 per cent rule that the button works loose and is lost! Even in
less exalted circles, any absolute ruler, on however petty a scale, is
liable to go the whole hog in an unexceptionably hoggish fashion. He has
none to gainsay him, and he sees no reason for controlling himself. This
suits nearly everybody pretty well; the shrewd Wazir can govern while
his “master” fills up on “The King’s Peg” (we must try one when
champagne is once again reasonably cheap) and all the other sensuous and
sensual delights unstinted. The result is that by the time he is
twenty—he was probably married at 12—he is no longer fitted to carry out
his very first duty to the State, the production of an heir.<br />
Quite contrary to this is the career of the “Holy Man.” Accustomed to
the severest physical toil, inured to all the rigours of climate, aloof
from every noxious excess, he becomes a very champion of virility.<br />
(Of course, there are exceptions, but the average “holy man” is a fairly
tall fellow of his hands). More, he has been particularly trained for
this form of asceticism by all sorts of secret methods and practices;
some of these, by the way, I was able to learn myself, and found
surprisingly efficacious.<br />
So we have the law of supply and demand at work as uncomplainingly as
usual: the Holy Man prays for the threatened Dynasty, blesses the Barren
Queen; and they all live happy ever after. This is not an Arabian
Night’s Tale of Antiquity; it is the same today: there are very few
Englishmen who have spent any time in India who have not been approached
with proposals of this character.<br />
Similar conditions, curiously enough, existed in France; the “fils à
papa” was usually a hopeless rotter, and his wife often resorted to a
famous monastery on the Riviera, where was an exceptionally holy Image
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, prayers unto whom removed sterility. But
when M. Combes turned out the monks, the Image somehow lost its
virtue.<br />
Now get your Bible and turn up Luke VIII, 2! When the sal volatile has
worked, turn to John XIII 2,3 2 and ask a scholar what any Greek of the
period would have understood by the technical expressions there
unambiguously employed.<br />
Presently, I hope, you will begin to wonder whether, after all, the
“morality” of the middle classes of the nineteenth century, in
Anglo-Saxon countries, is quite as axiomatic as you were taught to
suppose.<br />
Please let me emphasise the fact that I have heard and seen these
conditions in Eastern countries with my own ears and eyes.
Vivekananda—certainly the best of the modern Indian writes on
Yoga—complained bitterly that the old grimalkin witches of New York who
called themselves his disciples had to be dodged with infinite
precaution whenever he wanted to spend an evening in the Tenderloin. On
the other hand, the Sheikh of Mish—and a very holy Sheikh he
was—introduced his “boyfriend” as such to me when I visited him in the
Sahara, without the slightest shame or embarrassment.<br />
Believe me, the humbug about “morality” in this country and the U.S.A.,
yes, even on the Continent in pious circles, is Hobgoblin No. 1 on the
path of the Wise. If you are fooled by that, you will never get out of
the stinking bog of platitudinous mouthings of make-believe “Masters.”
Need I refer to the fact that most of the unco’ guid are penny plain
hypocrites. A little less vile are those whose prejudices are Freudian
in character, who “compound for sins that they’re inclined to, By
damning those they have no mind to.”<br />
Even when, poor-spirited molluscs, they are honest, all that twaddle is
Negation. “Hang your clothes on a hickory limb, and don’t go near the
water!” does not produce a Gertrud Ederle. Thank God, the modern girl
has cast off at least one of her fetters—the ceinture de chastété!<br />
Perhaps we have now relaxed enough; we see that the “Holy man” is not
such a fool as he looks; and we may get on with our excursions into the
“Morality” of the Law of the New Aeon, which is the Aeon of Horus,
crowned and conquering child: and—“The word of the Law is Te..µa.”<br />
3. So much of The Book of the Law deals directly or indirectly with
morals that to quote relevant passages would be merely bewildering. Not
that this state of mind fails to result from the first, second, third
and ninety-third perusals! “When Duty bellows loud ‘Thou must!’<br />
The youth replies ‘Pike’s Peak or Bust!’” is all very well, or might be
if the bellow gave further particulars. And one’s general impression may
very well be that Thelema not only gives general licence to any fool
thing that comes into one’s head, but urges in the most emphatic terms,
reinforced by the most eloquent appeals in superb language, by glowing
promises, and by categorical assurance that no harm can possibly come
thereby, the performance of just that specific type of action, the
maintenance of just that line of conduct, which is most severely
depreciated by the high priests and jurists of every religion, every
system of ethics, that ever was under the sun!<br />
You may look sourly down a meanly-pointed nose, or yell “Whoop La!” and
make for Piccadilly Circus: in either case you will be wrong; you will
not have understood the Book.<br />
Shameful confession, one of my own Chelas (or so it is rather incredibly
reported to me) said recently:<br />
“Self-discipline is a form of Restriction.” (That, you remember, is “The
word of Sin …”.) Of all the utter rubbish! (Anyhow, he was a “centre of
pestilence” for discussing the Book at all.) About 90 % of Thelema, at a
guess, is nothing but self-discipline. One is only allowed to do
anything and everything so as to have more scope for exercising that
virtue.<br />
Concentrate on “…thou hast no right but to do thy will.” The point is
that any possible act is to be performed if it is a necessary factor in
that Equation of your Will. Any act that is not such a factor, however
harmless, noble, virtuous or what not, is at the best a waste of energy.
But there are no artificial barriers on any type of act in general. The
standard of conduct has one single touchstone.<br />
There may be—there will be—every kind of difficulty in determining
whether, by this standard, any given act is “right” or “wrong”: but
there should be no confusion. No act is righteous in itself, but only in
reference to the True Will of the person who proposes to perform it.
This is the Doctrine of Relativity applied to the moral sphere.<br />
I think that, if you have understood this, the whole theory is now
within your grasp; hold it fast, and lay about you!<br />
Of course, there must be certain courses of action which, generally
speaking, will be right for pretty well everybody. Some, per contra,
will be generally barred, as interfering with another’s equal
right.<br />
Some cases will be so difficult that only a Magister Templi can judge
them, and a Magus carry them wisely into effect. Fearsome
responsibility, I should say, that of the Masters who began the
buildingup of the New Aeon by bringing about these Wars!<br />
(I do wish that we had the sense to take our ideas of Peace conditions
from the Bible, as our rulers so loudly profess that they do. The Enemy
knows well enough that there is no other way to make a war pay.)<br />
Now then, I hope that we have succeeded in clarifying this exceptionally
muddy marish water of morality from most of its alien and toxic dirt;
too often the Aspirant to the Sacred Wisdom finds no firm path under his
feet; the Bog of Respectability mires him who sought the Garden of
Delights; soon the last bubbles burst from his choked lungs; he is
engulfed in the Slough of Despond.<br />
In the passive elements of Earth and Water is no creative virtue to
cleanse themselves from such impurity as they chance to acquire; it is
therefore of cardinal importance to watch them, guard them, keep their
Purity untainted and unsoiled; shall the Holy Grail brim with poison of
Asps, and the golden Paten be defiled with the Bread of Iniquity? Come
Fire, come Air, cleanse ye and kindle the pure instruments, that Spirit
may indwell, inform, inspire the whole, the One Continuous Sacrament of
Life!<br />
We have considered this Morality from quite a number of very different
points of view; wrought subtly and accurately into final shape, you
should find no further difficulty in understanding fully at least the
theoretical and abstract aspects of the business.<br />
But as to your own wit of judgment as to the general rules of your own
private Code of Morals, what is “right” and what is “wrong” for you,
that will emerge only from long self-analysis such as is the chief work
of the Sword in the process of your Initiation.</p>

Of earth upon their holiness!<br />
They fast, they eat fantastic food,<br />
They prate of beans and brotherhood,<br />
Wear sandals, and long hair, and spats,<br />
And think that makes them Arahats!<br />
How shall man still his spirit-storm?<br />
Rational dress and Food Reform!<br />
OLYMPAS I know such saints.<br />
MARSYAS An easy vice:<br />
So wondrous well they advertise!<br />
O their mean souls are satisfied<br />
With wind of spiritual pride.<br />
They’re all negation. “Do not eat;<br />
What poison to the soul is meat!<br />
Drink not; smoke not; deny the will!<br />
Wine and tobacco make us ill.”<br />
Magic is life: the Will to Live<br />
Is one supreme Affirmative.<br />
These things that flinch from Life are worth<br />
No more to Heaven than to Earth.<br />
Affirm the everlasting Yes!<br />
OLYMPAS Those saints at least score one success:<br />
Perfection of their priggishness!<br />
MARSYAS Enough. The soul is subtlier fed<br />
With meditation’s wine and bread.<br />
Forget their failings and our own;<br />
Fix all our thoughts on love alone!</p>
<p>1: This is a reference to the school of thought of Rudolf Steiner. By
the time of this writing, Steiner’s students were being taught that
Crowley was a “bad man.” Tit for tat. Anthroposophy presents a merging
of several branches of mysticism with dance and movement. It rewards
study, but one shouldn’t mention A.C. at the Steiner schools until one
has acquired what one wants! – WEH.<br />
2: John XIII, 2-3 in the King James translation reads: “And supper being
ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot,
Simon’s son, to betray him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all
things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God.”
Crowley, or the typesetter, or transcriber, may have got the references
slightly confused, as Luke VIII, 3 (KJV) reads:<br />
“And Joanna, the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many
others, which ministered unto him of their substance.” Crowley alludes
to this verse in a similar connection in The Gospel According to Saint
Bernard Shaw – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxxi-morality-2">Chapter LXXI: Morality (2)</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>The contents of your letter appalled me. I had hoped that you had
left behind forever all that quality of thinking. It is unclean. It is
stuffy and flabby. You write of a matter about which you cannot possibly
have information, and what you say is not even a good guess; it is
simply contrary to fact. It shows also that you have failed to grasp the
nature of the O.T.O. Its main raison d’être, apart from social and
political plans, is the teaching and use of a secret method of achieving
certain results. This secret is a scientific secret; it is guarded
against betrayal or abuse by a very simple automatic arrangement. Its
guardians cannot be “dying” any more than electricians as a class can
be. It is really difficult to answer your letters. You have got things
so higgledy-piggledy. You write of the constitutions of two orders, the
A.’. A.’. and the O.T.O.; yet you ignore the printed information about
them which you are supposed to have read.<br />
I have to answer each sentence of your letter separately, so incoherent
have you become!<br />
You are a “student” of A.’. A.’., and become a Probationer as soon as
you take and pass the examination. (This is intended mostly to make sure
that you have some general idea of the principal branches of the
subject, and know the more important correspondences,) The rest:—please
read One Star in Sight again, and do for God’s sake try to assimilate
the information there very clearly and very fully given!<br />
It is terrifyingly near the state of mind which we symbolise by
Choronzon, this hurrying flustered dash of yours from one point of view
to another: a set of statements all true after a fashion, but flung out
with such apprehensive agitation that a sensitive reader like myself
comes near to being upset.<br />
You say that you must tread the Path alone: quite true, if only because
anything that exists for you is necessarily part of yourself. Yet you
have to “go to others”, and you become a veritable busybody.<br />
You quote odd opinions at random without the means of estimating their
value.<br />
Cannot I ever get you to understand the difference between an honest and
dishonest teacher? I have always made it a rule never to put forward any
statement of which I cannot produce proof; when I venture a personal
opinion it is always Marked in Plain Figures to that effect. (I refer
you to Magick p.368: - p. 375, , paragraphs 1 and 2:. and p. 415,
paragraphs 000 and 00. We insist from the beginning on the individual
character of the work, and upon the necessity of maintaining the
objective and sceptical standpoint. You are explicitly warned against
reliance upon “authority,” even that of the Order itself.)<br />
Consider my own assets, personal, social, educational, experiential and
the rest: don’t you see that all I had to do was to put out some
brightly-coloured and mellifluous lie, and avoid treading on too many
toes, to have had hundreds of thousands of idiots worshipping me?</p>
<p>Please get a Konx om Pax somehow, and read p. XII:<br />
“It’s only too easy to form a cult,<br />
To cry a crusade with ‘Deus Vult’ . . . .<br />
”A pinch of Bible, a gallon of gas,<br />
And I, or any otherguess ass,<br />
Could bring to our mystical Moonlight Mass<br />
Those empty-headed Athenians.”<br />
and so on.</p>
<p>But I never forget that I am working on the 2,000 year basis; my work
will stand when all the pompous platitudes and pleasant pieties have
withered for the iridescent soft-soap bubbles that they are.<br />
Soap! Yes, indeed. I work on gold, and gold must be cleansed with
acid.<br />
I really cannot understand how you can be so inaccurate, with the very
text before your eyes! You write—“you write that in Jan. 1899 etc.” But
I don’t. Captain J. F. C. Fuller wrote it.1 A small point; but you must
learn to be careful about every tiniest detail.<br />
Then you go on about “not only invisible chiefs of the A.’. A.’. . . . .
. but also the Chiefs of the Golden Dawn . . .” The Golden Dawn is
merely the name for the Outer Order: see Magick pp. 230-231. You have
never been taught to read carefully. You write of Theoricus as the grade
following Neophyte: it isn’t. Back to <em>Magick</em> pp. 230-231!2 You
have never taken the trouble to go with me through the Rituals of
O.T.O., or you would not ask such questions. The O.T.O. is a training of
the Masonic type; there is no “astral” work in it at all, nor any Yoga.
There is a certain amount of Qabalah, and that of great doctrinal value.
But the really vital matter is the gradual progress towards disclosure
of the Secret of the Ninth Degree. To use that secret to advantage
involves mastery both of Yoga and of Magick; but neither is taught in
the Order. Now it comes to be mentioned, this is really very strange.
However, I didn’t invent the system; I must suppose that those who did
knew what they were about.<br />
To me it is (a) convenient in various practical ways, (b) a machine for
carrying out the orders of the Secret Chiefs of A.’. A.’., (c) by virtue
of the Secret a magical weapon of incalculable power.<br />
How do you know They are “invisible?” I foresee that sooner or later you
will be asking for more information about them, so I am planning a
separate letter to supply this. (See Letters IX, L and LXXVII)<br />
You are not “stuck.” You can use your Astral Body well enough: too well,
in one way. But I think you need a few more journeys with me: you ought
to get on to the stage where the vision results from a definite
invocation.<br />
Do please forget all these vague statements about the “clarification of
one’s dream-life” (meaning what?) and “shadow-thinking” (meaning what?)
These speculations are idle, and idleness is poison.<br />
In your very next paragraph you give the whole show away! “Artistically
it appeals to me—but not spiritually.” You have been spiritually
poisoned.<br />
What blasphemy more hideous could be penned? What lie so base, so false,
so nasty, what so devilish and deadly a doctrine? I feel contaminated by
the mere fact of being in a world where such filth is possible to
conceive. I am all but in tears to think of my beloved sister tortured
by so foul a denizen of the Abyss. Cannot you see in this the root of
all your toadstool spawn of miseries, of doubts, of fears, of
indecisions?<br />
As an Artist you are a consecrated Virgin Priestess, the Oracle of the
Most High. None has the right to approach you save with the most blessed
awe, with arms outstretched as to invoke your benediction.<br />
By “spiritually” you mean no more than “according to the lower and
middle-middle-class morality of the Anglo-Saxon of the period when
Longfellow and Tennyson were supposed to be poets, and Royal
Academicians painters.”<br />
There is a highly popular school of “occultists” which is 99 % an
escape-mechanism. The fear of death is one of the bogeys; but far deeper
is the root-fear—fear of being alone, of being oneself, of life itself.
With this there goes the sense of guilt.<br />
The Book of the Law cuts directly at the root of all this calamitous,
this infamous tissue of falsehood.<br />
What is the meaning of Initiation? It is the Path to the realisation of
your Self as the sole, the supreme, the absolute of all Truth, Beauty,
Purity, Perfection!<br />
What is the artistic sense in you? What but the One Channel always open
to you through which this Light flows freely to enkindle you (and the
world through you) with flowers of inexhaustible fervour and
flame?<br />
And you set up against That this spectre of grim fear, of shame, of
qualms and doubts, of inward quakings lest — — you are too stricken with
panic to see clearly what the horror is. You say “the elemental spirits
and the Archangels are watching.” (!) My dear, dear, sister, did you
invent these beings for no better purpose than to spy on you? They are
there to serve you; they are parts of your being whose function is to
enable you to reach further in one particular direction or another
without interference from the other parts, so long as you happen to need
them for some service or other in the Great Work.<br />
Please cleanse your mind once and for all of this delusion, disastrous
and most damnable, that there can be opposition between two essential
parts of your nature.<br />
I think this idea is a monstrous growth upon the tetanus-soaked soil of
your fear of “the senses.”<br />
Observe how all these mealy-mouthed prigs develop their distrust of Life
until hardly an action remains that is not “dangerous” or in some way
harmful. They dare not smoke, drink, love—do anything natural to them.
They are right!! The Self in them is Guilt, a marsh miasmal of foul
pestilence. Last, since “nature, though one expel it with a pitchfork,
always returns,” they do their “sins” in secret, and pile hypocrisy upon
the summit of all their other vices.<br />
I cannot write more; it makes me too sad. I hope there is no need. Do be
your Self, the radiant Daughter of the Muse!<br />
With that command I turn to other tasks.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally yours ever,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>1: If the reference is to one of the first four instalments of The
Temple of Solomon the King then her mistake was excusable since Fuller’s
author credit was buried away in the Index to Equinox vol. I, and given
Crowley’s habit of talking about himself in the third person it was not
an unreasonable assumption; if it was to anything in Equinox of the
Gods, she was right and Crowley was wrong since the section of that book
reprinted from Equinox I (7) was written by Crowley after Fuller had
broken with him – T.S.<br />
2: Her confusion probably stemmed from the fact that Crowley re-named
some of the Outer Order grades when reformulating the A.’.A.’.; Neophyte
is 1°=10° A.’.A.’. and 0° =0° in the original G.D.;<br />
Theoricus is 2°=9° G.D. where it follows 1°=10° Zelator (these titles
derive in the first instance from the Masonic Societas Rosicruciana who
may in turn have got them from the 18th century German “Golden and Rosy
Cross”) but is not an A.’.A.’. title – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxxii-education">Chapter LXXII: Education</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Education means “leading out”; this is not the same as “stuffing
in.”<br />
I refuse to enlarge on this theme; it is all-important. To extract
something, you should first know what is there. Here astrology ought to
give useful hints; its indications give the mind something to work on.
Experience makes “confirmation strong as Holy Writ;” but beware of à
priori. Do not be dogmatic; do not insist in the face of disappointment.
Astrology in education is useful as geology is to the prospector; it
tells you the sort of thing to look for, and the direction in which to
explore.<br />
There are, however, two main lines of teaching which are of universal
value to normal children; it is hardly possible to begin too
early.<br />
Firstly, accustom his ear from the start to noble sounds; the music of
nature and the rhythm of great poetry. Do not aim at his understanding,
but at his subconscious mind. Protect him from cacophonous noise; avoid
scoring any cheap success with him by inflicting jingles; do not insult
him by “baby-talk.”<br />
Secondly, let him understand, as soon as you start actual teaching, the
difference between the real and the conventional in what you make him
memorise. Nothing irritates children more than the arbitrary “because I
say so.”<br />
Nobody knows why the alphabet has the order which we know; it is quite
senseless. One could construct a much more rational order: e.g. the
Mother, the Single and the Double letters, all in the natural order of
the elements, planets and signs. Again, we have the “Missionary”
Alphabet, arranged “scientifically” as Gutturals, modified ditto,
Dentals, Labials, vowels and so on; a most repulsive concoction! But I
would not accept any emendation from the God Thoth himself; it is
infinitely simpler to stick to the familiar order. But explain to the
child that this is only for convenience, like the rule of the road;
indeed, like almost any rules!<br />
But when your teaching is of the disputable kind, explain that too;
encourage him to question, to demand a reason and to disagree. Get him
to fence with you; sharpen his wits by dialectic; lure him into thinking
for himself. I want tricks which will show him the advantages of a given
subject of study; make him pester you to teach him. We did this most
successfully at the Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu; let me give you an
instance: reading. One of us would take the children shopping and bring
up the subject of ice-cream. Where, oh where could we get some?
Presently one would exclaim and point to a placard and say, “I really do
believe there’ll be some there”—and lo! it was so. Then they would
wonder how one knew, and one would say: Why, there’s “Helados” printed
on that piece of card in the window. They would want to learn to read at
once. We would discourage them, saying what hard work it was, and how
much crying it cost, at the same time giving another demonstration of
the advantages. They would insist, and we should yield—to active, eager
children, not to dullards that hated the idea of “lessons.” So with
pretty well everything; we first excited the child’s will in the desired
direction.<br />
But (you ask) are there any special branches of learning which you
regard as essential for all?<br />
Yes.<br />
Our old unvalued friend St. Paul, the cunning crook who turned the
Jewish communism of the Apostles into an international ramp, saw in a
vision a man from Macedonia who said “Come over and help us!” This time
it has been a woman from California, but the purport of her plaints was
identical.<br />
Much as I should like to see my Father the Sun once more before I die,
nothing doing until—if ever—life recovers from the blight of
regulations. Luckily, one thing she said helps us out: someone had told
her that I had written on Education in Liber Aleph—The Book of Wisdom or
Folly—which has been ready for the printer for more than a quarter of a
century—and there’s nothing I can do about it!<br />
However, I looked up the typescript. The book is itself Education; there
are, however, six chapters which treat of the subject in the Special
sense in which your question has involved us.<br />
So I shall fling these chapters headlong into this letter.</p>
<p>DE VOLUNTATE JUVENUM 1</p>
<p>Long, O my Son, hath been this Digression from the plain Path of My
word concerning Children; but it was most needful that thou shouldst
understand the Limits of true Liberty. For that is not the Will of any
Man which ultimateth in his own Ruin and that of all his Fellows; and
that is not Liberty whose Exercise bringeth him to Bondage. Thou mayst
therefore assume that it is always an essential Part of the Will of any
Child to grow to Manhood or to Womanhood in Health, and his Guardians
may therefore prevent him from ignorantly acting in Opposition
thereunto, Care being always taken to remove the cause of the Error,
namely, Ignorance, as aforesaid. Thou mayst also assume that it is Part
of the Child’s Will to train every Function of the Mind; and the
Guardians may therefore combat the Inertia which hinders its
Development. Yet here is much Caution necessary, and it is better to
work by exciting and satisfying any natural Curiosity than by forcing
Application to set Tasks, however obvious this Necessity may appear.</p>
<p>DE MODO DISPUTANDI 2</p>
<p>Now in this training of the Child is one most dear Consideration that
I shall impress upon thee as is Conformity without holy Experience in
the way of Truth. And it is this that since that which can be thought is
not true, every Statement is in some sense false. Even on the Sea of
Pure Reason, we may say that every Statement is in some Sense
disputable. Therefore in every Case, even the simplest, the Child should
be taught not only the Thesis, but also its opposite, leaving the
Decision to the child’s own Judgment and good Sense, fortified by
Experience. And this Practice will develop its Power of Thought, and its
Confidence in itself, and its Interest in all Knowledge. But most of all
beware against any Attempt to bias its Mind on any Point that lieth
without the Square of ascertained and undisputed Fact. Remember also,
even when thou art most sure, that so were they sure who gave
Instruction to the young Copernicus. Pay Reverence also to the Unknown
unto whom thou presumest to impart thy knowledge; for he may be one
greater than thou.</p>
<p>DE VOLUTATE JUVENIS COGNOSCENDA 3</p>
<p>It is important that thou shouldst understand as early as may be what
is the true Will of the Child in the Matter of his Career. Be thou well
aware of all Ideals and Daydreams; for the Child is himself, and not thy
Toy. Recall the comic Tragedy of Napoleon and the King of Rome; build
not an House for a wild Goat, nor plant a Forest for the Domain of a
Shark. But be thou vigilant for every Sign, conscious or unconscious, of
the Will of the Child, giving him then all Opportunity to pursue the
Path which he thus indicates. Learn this, that he, being young, will
weary quickly of all false Ways, however pleasant they may be to him at
the Outset; but of the true Way he will not weary. This being in this
Manner discovered, thou mayst prepare it for him perfectly; for no man
can keep all Roads open for ever. And to him making his Choice explain
how one may not travel far on any one Road without a general Knowledge
of Things apparently irrelevant. And with that he will understand, and
bend him wisely to his Work.</p>
<p>DE ARTE MENTIS COLENDI (1) MATHEMATICA 4</p>
<p>Now, concerning the first Foundation of Thy Mind I will say somewhat.
Thou shalt study with Diligence in the Mathematics, because thereby
shall be revealed unto thee the Laws of thine own Reason and the
Limitations thereof. This Science manifesteth unto thee thy true Nature
in respect of the Machinery whereby it worketh, and showeth in pure
Nakedness, without Clothing of Personality or Desire, the Anatomy of thy
conscious Self.<br />
Furthermore, by this thou mayst understand the Essence of the Relations
between all Things, and the Nature of Necessity, and come to the
Knowledge of Form. For this Mathematics is as it were the last Veil
before the Image of Truth, so that there is no Way better than our Holy
Qabalah, which analyseth all Things soever, and reduceth them to pure
Number; and thus their Natures being no longer coloured and confused,
they may be regulated and formulated in Simplicity by the Operation of
Pure Reason, to their great Comfort in the Work of our Transcendental
Art, whereby the Many become One.</p>
<p>SEQUITUR (2) CLASSICA 5</p>
<p>My son, neglect not in any wise the study of the Writings of
Antiquity, and that in the original Language. For by this thou shalt
discover the History of the Structure of thy Mind, that is, its Nature
regarded as the last Term in a Sequence of Causes and Effects. For thy
Mind hath been built up of these Elements, so that in these Books thou
mayst bring into the Light thine own sub-conscious Memories. And thy
Memory is as it were the Mortar in the House of thy Mind, without which
is no Cohesion or Individuality possible, so that it is called Dementia.
And these Books have lived long and become famous because they are the
Fruits of ancient Trees whereof thou art directly the Heir, wherefore
(say I) they are more truly germane to thine own Nature than Books of
Collateral Offshoots, though such were in themselves better and wiser.
Yes, O my son, in these Writings thou mayst study to come to the true
Comprehension of thine own Nature, and that of the whole Universe, in
the dimensions of Time, even as the Mathematic declareth it in that of
Space: that is, of Extension.<br />
Moreover, by this Study shall the Child comprehend the Foundation of
Manners: the which, as sayeth one of the Sons of Wisdom, maketh Man.</p>
<p>SEQUITUR (3) SCIENTIFICA 6</p>
<p>Since Time and Space are the conditions of Mind, these two Studies
are fundamental. Yet there remaineth Causality, which is the Root of the
Actions and Reactions of Nature. This also shalt thou seek ardently,
that thou mayest comprehend the Variety of the Universe, its Harmony and
its Beauty, with the Knowledge of that which compelleth it. Yet this is
not equal to the former two in Power to reveal thee to thyself; and its
first Use is to instruct thee in the true Method of Advancement in
Knowledge, which is, fundamentally, the observation of the Like and
Unlike. Also, it shall arouse in thee the Ecstasy of Wonder; and it
shall bring thee to a proper Understanding of Art Magick. For our Magick
is but one of the Powers that lie within us undeveloped and unanalysed;
and it is by the Method of Science that it must be made clear, and
available to the Use of Man. Is not this a Gift beyond Price, the Fruit
of a Tree not only of Knowledge but of Life? For there is that in Man
which is God, and there is that also which is Dust; and by our Magick we
shall make these twain one Flesh, to the Obtaining of the Empery of the
Universe.<br />
I suppose I might have put it more concisely: Classics is itself
Initiation, being the key of the Unconscious; Mathematics is the Art of
manipulating the Ruach, and of raising it to Neschamah; and Science is
co-terminous with Magick.<br />
These are the three branches of study which I regard as fundamental. No
others are in the same class. For instance, Geography is almost
meaningless until one makes it real by dint of honest travel, which does
not mean either “commuting” or “luxury cruises,” still less
“globe-trotting.” Law is a specialised study, with a view to a career;
History is too unsystematic and uncertain to be of much use as mental
training; Art is to be studied for and by one’s solitary self; any
teaching soever is rank poison.<br />
The final wisdom on this subject is perhaps the old “Something of
everything, and everything of something.”</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. Better mention, perhaps, that literacy is no test of education.
For ignorance of life, the don class leaves all others at the post; and
it is these monkish and monkeyish recluses, with their hideous clatter
and cackle, “The tittering, thin-bearded, epicene,” “Dwarf, fringed with
fear,” the obscene vole, dweller by and in backwaters that has foisted
upon us the grotesque and poisonous superstition that wisdom abides only
in dogs-eared, worm-eaten, mule-inspired long-forgotten as misbegotten
folios. I like the story—it is a true tale—of the old Jew millionaire
who bought up the annual waste of the Pennsylvania Railroad—a matter of
Three Million Dollars. He called with his cheque very neatly made
out—and signed it by making his mark! The Railroad Man was naturally
flabbergasted, and could not help exclaiming, “Yet you made all those
millions of yours—what would you have been if only you had been able to
read and write?” “Doorkeeper at the Synagogue” was the prompt reply. His
illiteracy had disqualified him when he applied for the job after
landing.<br />
The story is not only true, but “of all Truth;” see my previous letter
on “Certainty.”<br />
Books are not the only medium even of learning; more, what they teach is
partial, prejudiced, meagre, sterile, uncertain, and alien to reality.
It follows that all the best books are those which make no pretence to
accuracy: poetry, theatre, fiction. All others date. Another point is
that Truth abides above and aloof from intellectual expression, and
consequently those books which bear the Magic Keys of the Portal of the
Intelligible by dint of inspiration and suggestion come more nearly to
grips with Reality than those whose appeal is only to the Intellect.
“Didactic” poetry, “realistic” plays and novels, are contradictions in
terms.</p>
<p>P.P.S. One more effort: the above reminds me that I have said no word
about the other side of the medal. There are many children who cannot be
educated at all in any sense of the word. It is an abominable waste of
both of them and of the teacher to push against brick walls. Yet one
last point.<br />
I am as near seventy as makes no matter, and I am still learning with
all my might. All my life I have been taught: governesses, private
tutors, schools, private and public, the best of the Universities: how
little I know! I have travelled all over the world in all conditions,
from “grand seigneur,” to “holy man;” how little I know!<br />
What then of the ninety-and-nine, dragged by the ears through suicide
examinations, and kicked out of school into factory in their teens? They
have learnt only just enough to facilitate the swallowing of the gross
venal lies of the radio and the Yellow Press; or, if mother-wit has
chanced to warn them, they learn a little—very little—more, getting
their Science from a Shilling Handbook and so on, till they know just
enough to become dangerous agitators.<br />
No, anything like a real education demands leisure, the conversation of
the wise, the means to travel, and the rest.<br />
There is only one solution: to pick out the diamonds from the clay, cut
them, polish them, and set them as they deserve. Attempt no idiot
experiments with the muck of the mine! You will observe that I am
advocating an aristocratic revolution. And so I am!<br />
P.P.P.S. Short of the ideals above outlined, you may as well have a pis
aller—words of astonishing insight and wisdom, not alien to the Law
Thelema, and written by one who was trained on The Book of the Law.
“Self-confidence must be cultivated in the younger members of the nation
from childhood onwards. Their whole education and training must be
directed towards giving them a conviction that they are superior to
others”, wrote Hitler.<br />
“In the case of female education,” I read on, “the main stress should be
laid on bodily training, after that on character, and, last of all, on
the intellect; but the one absolute aim of female education must be with
a view to the future mother.”They are quoted as an extreme example of
all that is horrible and evil by Mr George E. Chust of the Daily
Telegraph—from Mein Kampf!<br />
P.P.P.P.S. There is a game, an improvement on the “Spelling Bee”—I have
anti-christened it “Fore and aft” so as to be natty and naval—which is
in my opinion one of the three or four best indoor games for two ever
invented. Here are the rules, in brief: any disputed points? Apply to
me.<br />
1. A “Word” consists of four or more letters.<br />
2. It must be printed in big black type in the Dictionary chosen for
reference. (Nuttall’s is fairly good, though some very well-known words
are omitted. The Oxford Pocket Dictionary is useless; it is for morons,
illiterates, wallowers in “Basic English”—and [I suppose] Oxonians. No
proper names, however well-known, unless used as common: e.g. Bobby, a
flatfoot, a beetle-crusher, a harness bull; or Xantippe, a shrew, a
lady. X-rays is given in the plural only: ditto “Rontgen-rays”, and they
give “Rontgenogram”. “You never can tell!” Participles, plurals and the
like are not “words” unless printed as such in big black type. E.g.
Nuttall’s “Juttingly” is a word; “jutting” is not, being in smaller
type.<br />
“Soaking” is in small type, but also in big type as a noun; so it is a
word.)<br />
3. The Dictionary is the sole and final arbiter. This produces
blasphemy, but averts assassination.<br />
4. The first player starts with the letter A. The second may put any
letter he chooses either before or after that A. The other continues as
he will, and can.<br />
5. The player who cannot add a letter without completing a “word” loses.
They proceed to B, and so on to Z.<br />
6. A player whose turn it is must either add his letter within a
reasonable (This is a matter of good feeling, courtesy and
consideration) time, may say “I challenge” or, alternatively, “That is a
‘word’.”<br />
The other must then give the “word” that he intends, or deny that it is
a “word” within the meaning of the Art, as the case may be. The
Dictionary decides the winner. The challenged player may give one word
only, and that in the form which is printed in the Dictionary; e.g. if
he were challenged at BRUSS, and answered Brussels, he would lose; if
BRUSSELS-SPROUTS, he would win. Hyphens need not be given. CASHMERE is a
“word”; it is a kind of shawl, etc., so is CHARLEY, a
night-watchman.<br />
Don’t argue: the Dictionary decides.<br />
7. This game calls not only for an extensive vocabulary but for courage;
foresight, judgment, resource, subtlety and even low cunning. It can be
played by more than two players, but the more there are, the more the
element of chance comes in; and this is hateful to really fine players
and diminishes the excitement. The rapier-play of two experts, when a
word changes from one line of formation to another, and then again,
perhaps even a third time, is as exhilarating as a baseball-game or a
bull-fight. And what the Tartarus-Tophet-Jehanna has all this to do with
Education, and the Great Work? This, child! H. G. Wells and others have
pointed out with serene justice that a gap in your vocabulary implies a
gap in your mind; you lack the corresponding idea. Too true, “Erbert!
But I threap that a pakeha with such xerotes as his will chowter with an
arsis of ischonophony, beyond aught that any fub, even in Vigonia and
dwale mammodis with a cascade from a Dewan tauty, a kissme-quick, a chou
over her merkin and a parka over her chudder could do to save him, and
have an emprosthotonos, when he reads this. Sruti!<br />
(Whaur’s your Wullie Chaucer noo?)<br />
I put this in for you because an American officer, 7 very dear to me,
flitted from the Front for a few days to ask me a few questions—oh,”very
much above your exalted grade” my dear—and I thought it might be useful
to him to learn this game, needing, as it does, such very meagre
apparatus, to wile away some of the long hours between attacks. He
picked it up quickly enough; but, after a bit when I suggested that he
should pass it on to his comrades-in-arms, he jeered at me openly!<br />
Their vocabulary to mine, he said, holds just about the same proportion
as mine does to yours; I hypothesised modestly, “about five per cent.”
(After all, I am forty-five years his senior.) He roared at me. “Not one
in a hundred,” he said, “know so much as the names of nine-tenths of the
subjects that I discuss habitually and fluently. They gasp, they gape,
they grunt, the gibber; it is almost always black bewilderment. And some
of them are college graduates—which I’m not.”<br />
He was snatched from school, and given a commission on the spot,
apparently because he was one of very few that could be differentiated
from the average Learned Pig.<br />
All this made me exceeding sorrowful. I began to understand why my Liber
OZ, written entirely in words of one syllable only, with this very idea
in mind, turned out to be completely beyond the average man’s (or
woman’s) understanding. I had some Mass Observation done on it.<br />
“But this is rank socialism,” “Say, ayn’t this all Fascism?” “Oh Golly!”
“Cripes!” “Coo!” “How dreadful!”<br />
about the nearest most of them got to Ralph Straus and Desmond
MacCarthy!<br />
Words of one syllable! Louis Marlow8 had already told me what a fool I
was to expect that. “All they can digest,” said he, “is a mess of stewed
clichés with Bird’s custard Power.”<br />
Damn everything—it’s true, it’s true.<br />
So do you at least get together the stones that you need to build your

“Monsters”, Niggers, Jews, etc.</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Come now, is this quite fair? When I agreed to tip you off about
Magick and the rest, I certainly never expected to be treated as if I
were being interviewed by an American Sunday Newspaper.<br />
What do I prefer for breakfast, and my views on the future of the
theatre, and is the Great White Brotherhood in favour of Eugenic Babies?
No, dear sister—I nearly said sob-sister. But this I will say, you have
been very artful, and led me on very cleverly—you must have been a
terror to young men—for the matter of that, I dare say you are
still!<br />
And I don’t see how to get out of swallowing this last sly bait; as you
say, “Every man and every woman is a star.” does need some attention to
the definition of “man” and “woman.” What is the position, you say, of
“monsters”? And men of inferior” races, like the Veddah, Hottentot and
the Australian Black fellow? There must be a line somewhere, and will I
please draw it? You make me feel like Giotto!<br />
There is one remark which I must make at the beginning. It’s some poet
or other, Tennyson or Kipling, I think (I forget who) that wrote: “Folks
in the loomp, is baad.” It is true all round. Someone wisely took note
that the vilest man alive had always found someone to love him. Remember
the monster that Sir Frederick Treves picked up from an East End
peep-show, and had petted by princesses? (What a cunning trick!)
Revolting, all the same, to read his account of it. He—the monster, not
Treves!—seems to have been a most charming individual—ah! That’s the
word we want. Every individual has some qualities that endear him to
some other. And per contra, I doubt if there is any class which is not
detestable to some other class. Artists, police, the clergy, “reds,”
foxhunters, Freemasons, Jews, “heaven-born,” women’s clubwomen
(especially in U.S.A.), “Methodys,” golfers, dog-lovers; you can’t find
one body without its “natural” enemies. It’s right, what’s worse; every
class, as a class, is almost sure to have more defects than qualities.”
As soon as you put men together, they somehow sink, corporatively, below
the level of the worst of the individuals composing it. Collect scholars
on a club committee, or men of science on a jury; all their virtues
vanish, and their vices pop out, reinforced by the self-confidence which
the power of numbers is bound to bestow.<br />
It is peculiarly noticeable that when a class is a ruling minority, it
acquires a detestation as well as a contempt for the surrounding “mob.”
In the Northern States of U.S.A., where the whites are overwhelming in
number, the “nigger” can be more or less a “regular fellow;” in the
South, where fear is a factor, Lynch Law prevails. (Should it? The
reason for “NO” is that it is a confession of weakness.) But in the
North, there is a very strong feeling about certain other classes: the
Irish, the Italians, the Jews. Why? Fear again; the Irish in politics,
the Italians in crime, the Jews in finance.<br />
But none of these phobias prevent friendship between individuals of
hostile classes.<br />
I think that perhaps I have already written enough—at least enough to
start you thinking on the right lines. And mark well this! The
submergence of the individual in his class means the end of all true
human relations between men. Socialism means war. When the class moves
as a class, there can be no exceptions.<br />
This is no original thought of mine; Stalin and Hitler both saw it
crystal-clear; both, the one adroitly, the other clumsily, but with
equally consummate hypocrisy, acted it out. They picked individuals to
rule under their autocracy, killed off those that wouldn’t fit,
destroyed the power of the Trades Unions or Soviets while pretending to
make them powerful and prosperous, and settled down to the serious
business of preparing for the war which both knew to be
inevitable.<br />
It is this fundamental fact which ensures that every democracy shall end
with an upstart autocrat; the stability of peace depends upon the
original idea which aggrandized America in a century from four millions
to a hundred: extreme individualism with opportunity. Our own longest
period of peace abroad (bar frontier skirmishes like the Crimean war)
and prosperity at home coincided with Free Trade and
Laissez-faire.<br />
Now we may return, refreshed, to the main question of monsters, real
(like Treves’) or imaginary like Jews and niggers.<br />
’Arf a mo! Haven’t we solved the problem, ambulando? Everything would be
okydoke and hunkydory if only we can prevent classes from acting as
such?<br />
I suppose so. Then, what about a spot of pithy paradox for a
change?<br />
Why should the classes want to act as classes? It’s obvious; “Union is
strength.” The worst Fifteen can do more with a football than the best
opposing team of one—excuse my Irish!<br />
Well, what tortoise is that elephant based upon? Why, still obviously,
upon the universal sense of individual weakness. We all want a big
bruvver to tell of him! Hence the Gods and the Classes. It’s fear at the
base of the whole pyramid of skulls.<br />
How right politicians are to look upon their constituents as cattle!
Anyone who has any experience of dealing with any class as such knows
the futility of appealing to intelligence, indeed to any other qualities
than those of brutes.<br />
And so, whenever we find one Man who has no fear like Ibsen’s Doctor
Stockmann or Mark Twain’s Colonel Grainger that strolled out on his
balcony with his shotgun to face the mob that had come to lynch him, he
can get away with it. “An Enemy of the People” wrote Ibsen, “Ye are
against the people, O my chosen!” says The Book of the Law. (AL II,
25).<br />
Not only does it seem to me the only conceivable way of reconciling this
and similar passages with “Every man and every woman is a star.” to
assert the sovereignty of the individual, and to deny the right-to-exist
to “class-consciousness,” “crowd-psychology,” and so to mob-rule and
Lynch-Law, but also the only practicable plan whereby we may each one of
us settle down peaceably to mind his own business, to pursue his True
Will, and to accomplish the Great Work. So never lose sight for a moment
of the maxim so often repeated in one context or another in these
letters: that fear is at the root of every possibility of trouble, and
that “Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure. Be thou therefore
without fear; for in the heart of the coward virtue abideth<br />
not.”</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxxiv-obstacles-on-the-path">Chapter LXXIV: Obstacles on
the Path</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Peccavi! And how! But my excuse is good, and I will try to make
amends. First, a little counter-attack—your letter is so rambling and
diffuse that at first I couldn’t make out what you were getting at, and
at last decided that it is much too random to reproduce, or even to deal
with in detail. I shall simply formulate the case for the Prosecution,
plead guilty, and appeal for clemency.<br />
The gravamen is that the Path of the Wise is gay with flowers, gilded
with kiosks, and beset with snares; that every step is the Abode of
Terror and Rapture—and all that! Yet I habitually write in the manner of
a drunken dominie! You “gasped for Aeschylus, and got Theognis.”<br />
I tempted you, it seems with The Chymical Marriage of Christian
Rosenkreutz, its incomparable mystery and glamour, its fugitive beauty,
its ineffable romance, its chivalry and its adventure, pellucid gleams
as of sunlight under the sea, vast brooding wings of horror
overshadowing the firmament, yet with strong Starlight constant
overhead. And then I let you down!<br />
You did expect at least something of the atmosphere of the Arabian
Nights; if not so high, of Apuleius and Petronius Arbiter; of Rabelais,
Meinhold, de la Motte Fouqué; and the Morte d’Arthur in later times, of
Balzac, Dumas, Lytton, Huysmans, Mabel Collins and Arthur Machen.<br />
You look at me with strange sad eyes: “But you, too, Master, have not
you too led a life as strange, as glamorous, as weird and as romantic,
as the best of them? Then why this cold detachment from that ambience?”
Well, if you put it like that, I can only say that I feel at the same
time more guilty and entirely innocent!<br />
For, while the charge is true, the defence is not to be shaken.<br />
The worst of all teachers are the Boloney Magnates, of whom I have
already given some account. But the next worst are just exactly those
who try to create an atmosphere of romance, and succeed only in a crude
theatricalism. So, avoiding the swirling turmoil of Scylla, I have
broken the ship on the barren rock Charybdis.1<br />
Now let me hearten you, brave sister! All the old tales are true! You
can have as many dragons, princesses, vampires, knights-errant,
Glendowers, enchanted apes, Jinn, sorcerers and incubi as you like to
fancy, and—whoa Emma! did I tell you about Cardinal Newman? Well, I
will.<br />
The one passage in his snivelling Apologia which impressed me was a tale
of his childhood—before the real poet, lover and mystic had been buried
beneath the dung-heap of Theology. He tells us that he read the Arabian
Nights—in a heavily Bowdlerised edition, bet you a tosser!—and was
enchanted, like the rest of us, so that he sighed “I wish these tales
were true!” The same thing happened to me; but I set my teeth, and
muttered: “I will make these tales true!”<br />
Well, I have, haven’t I? You said it yourself!<br />
Let me be very frank about one point. It has always puzzled me
completely why one is forbidden to relate certain of one’s adventures.
You remember, perhaps, in one of these letters I started out gaily to
tell you some quite simple things—I couldn’t, can’t, see quite what harm
could come of it—and I was pulled up sharp—yes, and actually punished,
like a school-boy! I had often done much more impudent things, and
nobody seemed to give a hoot. Oh somebody tell me why!<br />
The only suggestion that occurs to me is that I might somehow be “giving
occasion to the enemy to blaspheme.” Let it go at that! “Enough of
Because! Be he damned for a dog!” Yes child, my deepest attitude is to
be found in my life. I have been to most of the holy inaccessible
places, and talked with the most holy inaccessible men; I have dared all
the most dangerous adventures, both of the flesh and of the spirit; and
I challenge the world’s literature to match for sublimity and terror
such experiences as those in the latter half of The Vision and the
Voice.<br />
You understand, of course, that I say all this merely in indication; or
rather, as I said before, as an appeal for clemency.<br />
On the contrary (you will retort) you are a mean cat (Felis Leo,
please!) not to let us all in on the ground floor of so imposing a
Cathedral!<br />
To atone? Not a catalogue, which would be interminable; not a
classification, which would be impossible, save in the roughest terms;
nothing but a few short notes, possibly an anecdote or so.<br />
Just a tickle or a dram of schnapps, to enliven the
proceedings—ordeals—temptations—that sort of thing. A general Khabardar
karo! With now and then a snappy Achtung!<br />
Oh, curse this mind of mine! I just can’t help running to hide under the
broad skirts of the Qabalah!<br />
It’s Disk, Sword, Cup and Wand again! Sorry, but c’est trop fort pour
moi.<br />
Disks. To master Earth, remember that the Disk is always spinning; fix
this idea, get rid of its solidity.<br />
Commonly, the first tests of the young Aspirant refer to cash—“that’s
God’s sol solid in this world.”<br />
The proper magical attitude is very hard to describe. (I’m not talking
of that black hen’s egg anymore; that is simple.) Very sorry to have to
say it, but it is not unlike that of the spendthrift.<br />
Money must circulate, or it loses its true value. A banker in New York
once told me that the dollar circulated nine times as fast as the
English equivalent, so that people seemed to themselves to be nine times
as rich. (I told you about the £100 note in a special letter on Money).
But here I am stressing the spiritual effect; what happens is that
anxiety vanishes; one feel that as it goes out, so it comes in. This
view is not incompatible with thrift and prudence, and all that lot of
virtues, far from it, it tucks in with them quite easily. You must
practise this; there’s a knack in it. Success in this leads to a very
curious result indeed; not only does the refusal to count (Fourpennorth
or Yoga, please miss, and Mum says can I have a penny if I bring back
the bottle!), bring about the needlessness of counting, but also one
acquires the power to command!<br />
A century ago, very nearly, there lived in Bristol and “Open Brother”
names Muller, who was a wizard at this; Grace before breakfast, the
usual palaver about the Lord and His blessings and His bounty et cetera,
da capo; to conclude “and, Blessed Lord, we would humbly venture to
remind Thee that this morning Thou art £3 4s. 6 1/2d. short in the
accounts; trusting that Thou wilt give this small matter Thine immediate
attention, for Jesus’ Christ’s sake, Amen.” Sure enough, when he came to
open his post, there would be just enough, sometimes exactly enough, to
cover that amount.<br />
This story was told me by an enemy, who thought quite seriously that he
would go to Hell for being “Open.” (“Open” Brethren were lax about the
Lord’s Supper, let people partake who were not sound upon the Ramsgate
Question; and other Theological Atrocities!) It meant that the facts
were so undeniable that the “advertisement for Answer to Prayer”
outweighed the “miracle by a heretic.”<br />
I knew a poetess of great distinction who used to amuse herself by
breaking off a conversation and saying, “Give me a franc” (or a
shilling, or any small sum) and then going on with her previous remarks.
She told me that of over a hundred people I was the second who had
passed the coin to her without remark of any kind.<br />
This story—do you think?—is neither here nor there. No, my remarks are
rarely asyntartete. The Masters, at one stage or another of
initiation—it is forbidden to indicate the conditions—arrange for some
test of the Aspirant’s attitude in some matter, not necessarily
involving cash. If he fails, goodnight!<br />
Swords, now. The snags connected with this type of test are probably the
nastiest of any.<br />
Misunderstanding, confusion, logical error (and, worse, logical
precision of the kind that distinguishes many lunatics), dispersion,
indecision, failure to estimate values correctly—oh!—there is no end to
the list. So much so, indeed, that there is no specific critical test,
it is all part of the routine, and goes on incessantly.<br />
Well, there is just one. Without warning a decision of critical
importance has to be made by the candidate, and he is given so many
minutes to say Yes or No. He gets no second chance.<br />
But I must warn you of one particular disgrace. You know that people of
low mentality haunt fortunetellers of equal calibre, but with more low
cunning. They do not really want to know the future, or to get advice;
their real object is to persuade some supposed “authority” to flatter
them and confirm<br />
them in their folly and stupidity.<br />
It is the same thing with a terrifying percentage of the people that
come for “teaching” and initiation.”<br />
The moment they learn anything they didn’t know before, off they fly in
a temper! No sooner does it become apparent that the Master is not a
stupid middle-class prig and hypocrite—another edition of themselves, in
short—they are frightened, they are horrified, they flee away on both
their feet, like the man in the Bible! I have seen people turn
fish-belly pale in the face, and come near fainting<br />
outright, when it has dawned upon them suddenly that magick is a real
thing!<br />
It’s all beyond me!<br />
Cups: we are much more definite again. The great test is so well known,
and accounts have already been published, that it can be here plainly
stated. Early in his career, the Aspirant is exposed to the seductions
of a Vampire, and warned in due form and due season.<br />
“Sleep with A,B,C,D,E and F, my lad, and our hearty best wishes! But not
with G on any account, on peril of your work!”<br />
So off he goes to G, without a second’s hesitation. This test may be
prolonged; the deadliness and subtlety of the danger has been
recognised, and he may have half a dozen warnings, either direct or
springing from his relations with her. And the penalty is not so
drastically final; often he gets off with a term of penal
servitude.<br />
On the other hand, the Aspirant who can spot at the first hint why the
Masters think that particular woman a danger, and acts promptly and
decisively as he should, is secretly marked down as a sword of very fine
temper indeed!<br />
The rest of the Cup Ordeals consists for the most part of progressive
estimations of the quality of the Postulant’s devotion to the work;
there is not, as a rule, anything particularly spectacular or dramatic
in it. If you stick to your Greetings and Adorations and all such
mnemonics, you are not likely to go<br />
very far wrong.<br />
Wands: this obviously a pure question of Will. You will find as you go
on that obstacles of varying degrees of difficulty confront you; and the
way in which you deal with them is most carefully watched.<br />
The best advice that I can give is to remember that there is little need
of the Bull-at-a-Gate method, though that must always be ready in
reserve; no, the best analogy is rapier-play. Elastic strength.<br />
Warfare shows us.<br />
That seems to cover your question more or less; but don’t forget that it
depends on yourself how much of the dramatic quality colours your Path.
I suppose I have been lucky to have had the use of all the traditional
trappings; but it is always possible to make a “coat of many colours”
out of a heap of rags. To show you that you have had Chaucer and John
Bunyan—yes, and Laurence Sterne: to bring up the rear, James Thomson
(B.V.) to say nothing of Conrad and Hardy. Nor let me forget The Cream
of the Jest and The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck of my friend, James
Branch Cabell.<br />
So now, fair damozel, bestride thy palfrey, and away to the Mountains of
Magick!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. One danger I had purposely passed over, as it is not likely to
come your way. But, since others may read these letters—Some, and these
the men of highest promise, often of great achievement, are tempted by
Treason. They acquire a “Judas-complex,” think how splendid it would be
if they were to destroy the Order—or, at the very least, unhorse the
Master.<br />
This is, of course, absurd in itself, because if they had crossed the
Abyss, they would understand why it is impossible. It would be like
“destroying Electricity,” or “debunking” the Venus of Milo. The maximum
of success possible in such an operation would be to become a
“Black-Brother;” but what happens in practice, so far as my own
experience goes, is complete dispersion of the mental faculties
amounting to suicide; I could quote no less than four cases in which
actual physical self-murder was the direct result.<br />

<h3 id="chapter-lxxv-the-a..a..-and-the-planet">Chapter LXXV: The
A.’.A.’. and the Planet</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You Write:<br />
Am I to understand that the A.’. A.’. has two main lines of Work. (1)
The initiation of Individuals, (2) Action on the world in general—say
“Weltpolitik”? Because your letters on the# History of Magick do imply
(2); and yet the A.’. A.’. discourages any form of group working. Is it
that the Masters (8° = 3° Magistri Templi) having been admitted to the
Third Order—the A.’. A.’. proper; below this are R.R. et A.C. and G.’.
D.’.—are no longer liable to the dangers which make group activity in
lower grades undesirable. Or do they still work as Individuals, yet,
because they are initiates, appear to act as a corporate body? You have
often expressed yourself as if this were so. ‘Of course, They had to
pick on me to do the dirty work’ is a typical growl of the old Big Lion!
But again there is that Magical Memory of yours when you came down from
that Hermitage in the little wood overhanging the nullah below the Great
Peak ‘somewhere in Asia’ and sat in some sort of Consistory in the
valley where the great Lamaserai—or whatever it was—towers over the
track, (I quote some of your phrases from memory.) Which is it?”<br />
My dear child, that is all very sensibly put; and the answer is that
Convenience would decide. Then you go on, after a digression:<br />
“Then how are They acting at present? What impact has the new Word,
Thelema, made upon the planet? What are we to expect as a result? And
can we poor benighted outsiders help Them in any way? I know it’s
‘cheek’ to ask.” then turn the other cheek, and repeat the question! I
will do my best to make it all clear. But do not forget that I am myself
completely in the dark with regard to the special functions of most of
my colleagues.<br />
To begin, then!<br />
Achtung! I am going to be hard-boiled; my first act is to enlist the
Devil himself in our ranks, and take the Materialistic Interpretation of
History from Karl Marx, and accept economic laws as the manifest levers
which determine the fortune of one part of the earth or another.<br />
I shall take exception only by showing that these principles are
secondary: oil in Texas, nitrates on the Pacific slope of the Andes,
sulphur in Louisiana (which put Etna’s nose out of joint by making it
cheaper for the burgers of Messina to import it from four thousand miles
away instead of digging it out of their own back garden), even coal and
timber, upset very few apple-carts until individual genius had found for
these commodities such uses as our grandfathers never dreamed.<br />
The technical developments of almost every form of wealth are the
forebears of Big Business; and Big Business, directly or indirectly, is
the immediate cause of War.<br />
In the “To-day and to-morrow” series is an essay called Ouroboros, by
Garet Garrett; one of the most shrewd and deep-delving analysis of
economics ever written. May I condense him crudely? Mass Production for
profit fails when its markets are exhausted; so every effort is made to
impose it not only on the native but the foreigner, and should guile
fail, then force!<br />
But the process ineluctably goes on; when the whole world buys the nasty
stuff, and will accept no other, the exploiter is still faced by
diminishing returns. No possibility of expansion; sooner or later
dividends dwindle, and the Business is Bust.<br />
To even the most stupid it becomes plain at this stage that war is
wholly ruinous; organisation breaks down altogether; one meaningless
revolution follows another; famine and pestilence complete the
job.<br />
Last time—when Osiris replaced Isis—the wreck was limited in scope—note
that it was the civilised, the organised part that broke down. (Jews and
Arabs could remain aloof, and keep a small torch burning until Light
returned with the Renaissance.)<br />
This time there is no civilisation which can escape being involved in
the totality of the catastrophe.<br />
Towards this collapse all totalitarian movements inevitably tend.<br />
Bertrand Russell himself admits that, although himself “temperamentally
Anarchistic,” Society must be yet more organised than it is to-day if it
is to exist at all.<br />
But his, as Garet Garrett shows, is the John Gilpin type of
horsemanship. We are today more or less at the stage where “off flew
Gilpin’s hat and wig.”<br />
Achievement of high aims, which tends ultimately to the well-being, the
prosperity of the republic, depends on the proportion of masters to
servants. The stability of a building depends on the proportion of
superstructure to foundations. The rule holds good in every department
of Nature.<br />
There is an optimum for every case. If there is one barber for ten
thousand men, most of them will remain unshorn; if there are five
thousand barbers, most of them will be out of a job.<br />
Apply this measure to society; there must be an optimum relation between
industry and agriculture, between town and country. When the proper
balance is not struck, the community must depend on outside help,
importing what it lacks, exporting its surplus. This is an unnatural
state of affairs; it results in business, and therefore ultimately in
war. That is, as soon as the stress set up by the conditions becomes
insupportable. So long as “business” is confined to luxuries, no great
harm need result; but when interference with the flow of foreign trade
threatens actual necessities, the unit concerned realises that it is in
danger of strangulation. Consider England’s food supply! Switzerland,
Russia, China, the U.S.A. can laugh at U-boats. England must support a
Navy, a wealth-consuming, not a wealth-producing, item in the
Budget.<br />
Similar remarks apply to practically all Government Departments. The
minimum of organisation is desirable; all artificial doctrinaire
multiplication of works which produce no wealth is waste; and for many
reasons (some absurd, like “social position”) tend to create fresh
unnecessary necessities. Ad infinitum, like the fleas in the
epigram!<br />
When laws are reasonable in the eyes of the average man, he respects
them, keeps them, does his best to maintain them; therefore a minute
Police Force, with powers strictly limited, is adequate to deal with the
almost negligibly small criminal class. A convention is laudable when it
is convenient.<br />
When laws are unjust, monstrous, ridiculous, that same average man, will
he-nill he, becomes a criminal; and the law requires a Tcheka or a
Gestapo with dictatorial powers and no safeguards to maintain the farce.
Also, corruption becomes normal in official circles; and is excused. I
refer you to Mr. J. H. Thomas.<br />
One evil leads to another; the seven devils always take possession of a
house that is swept and garnished to the point at which people find it
uncomfortable.<br />
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, having fixed the increase of Income Tax
at threepence, proceeded to defraud the Insurance Companies by insuring
himself against a rise of the sum! But is not all this beside the point,
you ask? No. It was needful to indicate this cumulative progression to
social shipwreck, because, today an obvious peril of the most menacing,
in 1904 no ordinary sane person foresaw anything of the sort. But
special knowledge alters things, and it is certain that the Masters
anticipated, with great exactness of calculation, the way things would
go in the political world.<br />
Practically all the messages received during the “Cairo Working”
(March-April 1904 e.v.) came to me through Ouarda. No woman ever lived
who was more ignorant of, or less interested in, anything to do with
politics, or the welfare of the race; she cared for nothing beyond her
personal comfort and pleasure. When the communications ceased, she
dropped the whole affair without a thought.<br />
She nearly always referred to the authors of these messages as “They:”
when asked who “They” were, she would say haltingly and stupidly “the
gods,” or some equally unhelpful term. But she was always absolutely
clear and precise as to the instructions. The New Aeon was to supersede
the old; my special job was to preserve the Sacred Tradition, so that a
new Renaissance might in due season rekindle the hidden Light. I was
accordingly to make a Quintessence of the Ancient Wisdom, and publish it
in as permanent a form as possible. This I did in The Equinox. I should
perhaps have been strictly classical, and admitted only the “Publication
in Class”A”, “A-B”, “B” and “D” material. But I had the idea that it
would be a good plan to add all sorts of other stuff, so that people who
were not in any way interested in the real Work might preserve their
copies.<br />
This by the way: the essence this letter is to show that “They”, not one
person but a number acting in concert, not only foresaw a planet-wide
catastrophe, but were agreed on measures calculated to assure the
survival of the Wisdom worth saving until the time, perhaps three
hundred or six hundred years later, when a new current should revive the
shattered thought of mankind.<br />
The Equinox, in a word, was to be a sort of Rosetta Stone.<br />
There is one other matter of incomparable importance: the wars which
have begun the disintegration of the world have followed, each at an
interval of nine months, the operative publications of The Book of the
Law. This again seems to make it almost certain that “They” not only
know the future, at least in broad outline, but are at pains to arrange
it. I have no doubt that the advance of Natural Science is in the charge
of a certain group of “Masters.” Even the spiritually and morally as
well as the physically destructive phenomena of our age must be parts of
some vast all-comprehensive plan.<br />
Putting two and two together, and making 718, it looks as if the Masters
acquiesced in and helped to fulfil, the formula of the catastrophic
succession of the Aeons.<br />
An analogy. We have the secret of the Elixir of Life, and could carry on
in the same body indefinitely; yet at least some masters prefer to
reincarnate in the regular way, only taking care to waste no time in
Amennti, but to get back to the Old Bench and pick up the New Tools with
the minimum of delay.<br />
By having attained the Freedom of “Elysian, windless, fortunate abodes
Beyond Heaven’s constellated wilderness” “we are blessed; and bless” by
refusing to linger therein, but shouldering once more “Atlantean the
load of the too vast orb of” the Karma of Mankind.<br />
This hypothesis does at least make intelligible Their action in riding
for a fall instead of preventing it.<br />
It may also be that They feel that human progress has reached its
asymptote so far as the old Formula can take it. In fact, unless we take
some such view, there does not seem to be much point in taking an action
so fundamentally revolutionary (on the surface) as the proclamation of a
New Word.<br />
But then (you will object, if an objection it be) people like Lenin,
Hitler, Mussolini, the Mikado, et hoc genus omne, are loyal emissaries
of the Masters, or the gods! Well, why not? An analogy, once more. In
the Christian legend we find God (omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent)
employing Judas, Pilate and Herod, no less than Jesus, as actors in the
Drama which replaced Isis by Osiris in the Great Formula. Perfectly
true; but this fact does not in any way exculpate the criminals. It is
no excuse for the Commandants of Belsen and Buchenwald that they were
acting under orders. The Drama is not mere playacting, in which the most
virtuous man may play the vilest of parts.<br />
Your further objection, doubtless, will be that this theory makes the
Masters responsible for the agony of the planet. I refer you to The Book
of the Heart Girt with a Serpent, Ch I, v. 33-40.</p>

</li>
<li>O Lord God! let the haven be cast down by the fury of the storm! Let
the foam of the grape tincture my soul with Thy light!<br />
Yes, I dare say. But is there not here a sort of moral oxymoron? Are not
the Masters pursuing two diametrically opposed policies at the same
time?<br />
Genius—or Initiation, which implies the liberation and development of
the genius latent in us all (is not one of names of the “Holy Guardian
Angel” the Genius?)—is practically the monopoly of the “crazy
adventurer,” as the official mind will most certainly rate him. Then why
do not the Masters oppose all forms of organisation
tooth-and-nail?<br />
It depends, surely, on the stage which a society has reached on its fall
to the servile state. Civilisation of course, implies organization up to
a certain point. The freedom of any function is built upon system; and
so long as Law and Order make it easier for a man to do his True Will,
they are admirable. It is when system is adored for its own sake, or as
a means of endowing mediocrities with power as such, that the “critical
temperature” is attained.<br />
It so happens that I write this on the eve of a General Election in
England; and it seems to me that whichever wins, England loses: The
Socialists openly proclaim that they mean to run the country on the
lines of a convict prison; but the Tories, for all their fine talk,
would be helpless against the Banks and the Trusts to whom they must
look for support.<br />
Still, perhaps with a little help from Hashish, one can imagine a
Merchant Prince or a Banker being intelligent, or even, in a weak
moment, human; and this is not the case with officials. The standard,
moreover, of education and Good Manners, low as it is, is less low in
Tory circles.<br />
As I think that totalitarian methods are already on the way to
extinguish the last spark of manly independence—that is, in self-styled
civilised countries—it seems to me that we all should regard with shrewd
suspicion any plans for “perfecting” social conditions. The extreme
horror is the formula of the gregarious type of insect. Inherent in the
premises is the impossibility of advance.<br />
One may sum the policy of the A.’. A.’. as follows:<br />
</li>
<li>To assist the initiation of the individual.<br />
</li>
<li>To maintain a form of social order in which the adventure of
initiation is easy—to undertake!<br />
</li>
<li>To work out the Magical Formula of the New Aeon. “Ye-e-ss, I
s-e-e.”<br />
I doubt it. But what you are asking is how to decide upon your personal
programme.<br />
The intelligent visitor from who knows what planet was puzzled. He
chanced to have landed in England—to find a General Election in full
blast. (The operative word is “blast”.) They must be absolute imbeciles,
was his first reaction, to risk upsetting the policy of Government with
a first-class war on.<br />
(There would have been no need of such nonsense—I interrupted—if
Parliament was elected by my simple plan. I’ll give you the main idea; I
don’t insist on the figures. When a candidate is returned by 50 per-cent
over his runner-up, he sits for five years. If forty percent, four
years; and so on. An alternative—to “stagger” the assembly, as (I think)
is done in the Senate of the United States.)<br />
How are you going to vote?<br />
Rather like the question of the dentist.1 The teeth can be tinkered: of
course, sooner or later they have to go. Is it worth the trouble and
expense? The Socialists would have them all out right away, and replaced
by a set of “dentures,” which (obviously) are perfect. Arrange them,
change them, choose your own pattern; no trouble, no pain: all one’s
dream come true! But hardly biological.<br />
You may argue that convicts are examples of living individuals whose
safety, shelter, nourishment and the rest are organised with the utmost
care; but accidents will happen in the best-regulated “brown stone
jugs.” The one ideally automatic case is the foetus. You will agree that
here is lack of initiative;<br />
in fact, its “True Will” is to escape, albeit into a harsh and hostile
universe, fraught with unknown and incalculable dangers.<br />
As the Ritual says: “Prepare to enter the Immeasurable Region!”2<br />
I think your decision should depend on how far caries has travelled on
its road of destruction.<br />
I do not think that the Masters need be unanimous.<br />
A practical plan might be for them to concentrate on one particular
group, or one part of the world, and to keep this in as good shape as
possible until the time has come for Nature to grow a new set.<br />
They will be grown on a new Formula, to meet the new needs, just as when
our “permanent” (Alas, not much!) set replace our milk-teeth.<br />
You ask me if I think this change can be made without bloodshed.<br />
No. The obscure autocrats of Diplomacy and Big Business are infinitely
stupid and short-sighted; they cannot see an inch beyond their too often
stigmatically shapen probosces, except where the profit of the next
financial year is concerned. They live in perpetual panic, and shy at
their own shadows. The accordingly attack even the most innocuous
windmills in suicidal charges.<br />
Yes: bella, horrida bella, Et flavem Tibrim spumantem sanguine
cerno.<br />
So, whichever way you vote, you are asking for trouble, or would do, if
the vote had any meaning.<br />
The result of any election, or for the matter of that any revolution, is
an almost wholly insignificant component of those stupendous and
inscrutable Magical Forces which determine the destinies of the
planet.</li>

<h3 id="chapter-lxxvi-the-gods-how-and-why-they-overlap">Chapter LXXVI:
The Gods: How and Why they Overlap</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>I am glad: it shows you have been putting in some genuine original
work. Result! You make a very shrewd observation; you have noticed the
curious fashion in which Gods seem to overlap. It is not the same (you
point out) with Angels. In no other system do we find a parallel for the
Living Creatures, Wheels, Wings, Fiery Serpents,1 with such quasi-human
cohorts as the Beni Elohim who beget the children on women,2 to whom the
Qabalah has introduced us. The Beni Elohim is actually an exception;
there is the Incubus and some of the Fairy Folk, as well as certain Gods
and demi-Gods, who act thus paternally. But you are right in the main.
The Arabs, for example, have “seven heavens” and seven Orders of Angels,
also Jinn; but the classes are by no means identical. This, even though
certain Archangels, notably Gabriel, appear in both systems. But then
Gabriel is a definite individual, a person—and this fact is the key to
your puzzle.<br />
For, as I have explained in a previous letter, Gods are people:
macrocosms, not mere collocations of the elements, planets and signs as
are most of the angels, intelligences and spirits. It is interesting to
note that Gabriel in particular seems to be more than one of these; he
enjoys the divine privilege of being himself. Between you and me and the
pylon, I suspect that Gabriel who gave the Q’uran to Mohammed was in
reality a “Master” or messenger of some such person, more or less as
Aiwass describes himself as “…the minister of Hoor-paar- kraat.” (AL I,
7) His name implies some such function; for G.B.R. is Mercury between
the Two Greater Lights, Sol and Luna. This seems to mean that he is
something more than a lunar or terrestrial archangel; as he would appear
to be from 777.<br />
(There now! That was my private fiend again—the Demon of Digression.
Back to our Gods!) 777 itself, to say nothing of The Golden Bough and
the Good Lord knows how many other similar monuments of lexicography
(for really they are little more), is our text-book. We are bound to
note at once that the Gods sympathise, run into one another, coalesce
much more closely than any other of the Orders of Being. There is not
really much in common between a jackal and a beetle, or between a wolf
and an owl, although they are grouped under Pisces or Aries
respectively. But Adonis, Attis, Osiris, Melcarth, Mithras, Marsyas — —
— a whole string of them comes tripping off the tongue. They all have
histories; their birth, their life, their death, their subsequent
career; all goes naturally with them exactly as if they were (say) a set
of warriors, painters, anything superbly human. We feel instinctively
that we know them, or at least know of them in the same sense that we
know of our fellow men and women; and that is a sense which never so
much as occurs to us when we discuss Archangels. The great exception is
the Holy Guardian Angel; and this as I have shewn in another letter is
for exactly the same reason; He is a Person, a macrocosmic Individual.
(We do not know about his birth and so on; but that is because he is, so
to speak, a private God; he only appears to the world at all through
some reference to him by his client; for instance, the genius or
Augoeides of Socrates).<br />
Let us see how this works in practice. Consider Zeus, Jupiter, Amon- Ra,
Indra, etc., we can think of them as the same identical people known and
described by Greeks, Romans, Egyptians and Hindus; they differ as Mont
Cervin differs from Monte Silvio and the Matterhorn.<br />
(They are bound to appear different, because the mountain does not look
the same from Zermatt as it does from Domodossola, or even as seen by a
French-Swiss and a German-Swiss.) In the same way read the Life of
Napoleon written by one of his marshals, by Michelet (a rabid
Republican), by Lord Roseberry, by a patriotic Russian, and by a German
poet and philosopher: one can hardly believe that the subject of any two
of these biographies is the same man.<br />
But upon certain points the identity is bound to transpire; even when we
read of his crushing and classic defeat at Waterloo by the Belgians, the
man is detected. Transferring the analogy to the Gods, it is then open
to us to suppose that Tahuti, Thoth, Hermes, Mercury, Loki, Hanuman and
the rest are identical, and that the diversity of the name and the
series of exploits is due merely to the accidents of time and space. But
it is at least equally plausible to suggest that these Gods are
different individuals, although of the identical Order of Being,
characteristics and function. Very much as if one took Drake, Frobisher,
Raleigh, Hood, Blake, Rodney and Nelson, as seen through the mists of
history, tradition, legend and plain mythopoeia. Add a few names not
English, and our position is closely parallel. Personally, I incline to
the latter hypothesis; but it would be hard to say why, unless that it
is because I feel that to identify them completely would be to reduce
their stature to that of personifications of various cosmic
energies.<br />
History lends its weight to my view. When the philosophic schools,
unable to refute the charge of absurdity levelled at the orthodox
devotee who believed that Mars actually begot Romulus and Remus on a
Vestal Virgin, explained that Mars was no more than the martial
instinct, and the Virgin a type of Purity, their faith declined, and
with it Roman Virtue. “Educate” Colonel Blimp’s children and we have the
“intelligentsia” of Bloomsbury. I am very sorry about all this; but life
must always be brutal and stupid so long as it depends upon animals and
vegetables for nourishment.<br />
How restore faith in the Gods? There is only one way; we must get to
know them personally. And that, of course, is one of the principal tasks
of the Magician.<br />
One further remark. I have suggested that all these “identical” gods are
in reality distinct persons, but belonging to the same families. Can we
follow up this line of thought? Yes: but I will defer it to a subsequent
letter.</p>

Worthwhile: Why?</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Your remarks on my 0=2 letter are very apt and inspiriting—that is if
I have rightly understood what you want to say. (Really, you know, they
are a bit muddled—or I am!) May I frame your question, if it is a
question, in my own terms? Yes? Right.<br />
You say that I have advanced an invulnerable theory of the Universe in
philosophical and mathematical language, and you suppose (underlined
three times with two question marks) that one could, with a great
effort, deduce therefrom perfectly good reasons for an unswerving
contemplation of one’s umbilicus, or the performance of strange dances
and the vibration of mysterious names. But what are you to say (you
enquire) to the ordinary Bloke-on-the-Boulevard, to the man of the world
who has acquired a shrewd knowledge of Nature, but finds no rational
guide to the conduct of life.<br />
He observes many unsatisfactory elements in the way things go, and for
his own sake would like to “remould them nearer to the heart’s desire,
to refurbish the cliché of Fitzgerald about”this sorry scheme of
things.” He is not in the least interested in the learned exposition of
0 = 2. But he is aware that the A.’. A.’. professes a sound solution of
the problem of conduct and would like to know if its programme can be
justified in terms of Common Sense.<br />
As luck would have it, only a few weeks ago I was asked to address a
group of just such people—and they gave me three-quarters of an hour’s
notice. It was really more like ten minutes, as the rest of the time was
bespoke by letter-writing and posting which could in no wise be
postponed.<br />
So I had to devise an adequate gambit, one which ruthlessly excluded any
touch of subtlety, or any assumption of previous knowledge of the
subject on the part of the audience.<br />
It came off. For the first time in history, the laymen elicited
intelligent and relevant questions. There were only three half-wits in
the five score or so persons present, and these (naturally!) were just
those people who claimed to have studied the subject.<br />
What follows is a rough outline of my argument.<br />
I began by pointing out that Nature exercises many forms of Energy,
which are not directly observable by the senses. In fact, the History of
Science for the last hundred and fifty years or so has consisted
principally of the discovery of such types, with their analysis,
measurement and manipulation. There is every reason to suppose that many
such remain to be discovered.<br />
But what has in no case been observed is any trace of will or of
intelligence, except through some apparatus involving a nervous and
cerebral system.<br />
At this point I want especially to call your attention to certain
species of animals (bees and termites are obvious cases) where a
collective consciousness seems to exist, since the community acts as a
whole in evidently purposeful ways, yet the units of that community are
not even complete in themselves. (Isn’t there some series of worms, each
sub-type able only to subsist on the excrement of its preserver in the
series?)<br />
Then there are the phenomena of mob psychology, where a crowd gleefully
combine to perform acts which would horrify any single individual. And
there is the exceeding strange and interesting psychology of the
“partouse”—this is a little more, in my judgment, than a
spinthria.<br />
In all such cases the operative consciousness does not reside in any
single person, as one might argue that it did when an orator “carries
away” his audience. But these remarks have rather shunted one into a
siding away from the main line of argument. My most important point is
to insist that even with the most familiar forms of energy, man has done
no creative work so ever. He has discovered, examined, measured (rather
clumsily) and used, but in no case has he understood, still less
explained, the causes of phenomena. Sometimes he cannot even reconcile
different “laws of Nature.” So we find J.W.N. Sullivan exclaiming “The
scientific adventure may yet have to be abandoned,” and to me personally
he confessed “It may yet turn out that the mathematical approach to
Reality may have to be supplanted by the Magical.”<br />
Now in Nature it leaps at one that Will and Intelligence are behind
phenomena. My old friend and colleague Professor Buckmaster, who wrote a
book on “Blood” which, he admitted, could not possibly be understood by
more than six people, told me that the ingenuity of the structure of the
human kidney “almost frightened” him. Yet in all Nature there is no
trace whatever of any purpose such as human mentality can grasp. Again,
apparent purpose often appears to be baffled. Take one example.
Evolution, working through thousands of years to establish a most subtle
scheme of crossfertilisation, found, just as it was perfect, conditions
so altered that it was completely useless.<br />
The “law of cause and effect” itself took a death-blow when Hesinger
showed that the old formula “If A then B” was invalid, and must be
altered to “If A, then B or C or D or E or . . .”<br />
But at least we know enough phenomena to make it certain that Will and
Intelligence do exist somehow apart from any nervous and cerebral system
of which we are aware, and that these must be of a type which transcends
our human consciousness as that does that of a limpet or a lichen. It
follows that somehow, somewhere, there must be “gods” or
“Masters”—whatever name you like. And that, I suppose, is what you may
call the premise major of my syllogism.<br />
The minor, I confess, is not so apodictic. No one, I suppose, is going
to point proudly to the present state of human affairs, as evidence that
we are all becoming wiser and nobler every minute, as people did seventy
years ago. (I was brought up in the faith that Queen Victoria would
never die, and that Consols would never go below par.)<br />
In fact, one may suspect that the majority of well-instructed men expect
nothing but that History will repeat itself, and our civilisation go the
way of all the others whose ruins we dig up in every quarter of the
earth.<br />
(Our own destruction may be more complete than theirs; for most of the
monuments to our intelligence, sobriety and industry are made of steel,
and would vanish in a very few years after the smash.)<br />
Well, if we have to wait for the calamity, and for evolution to begin
all over again in a number of centuries—with luck!—one thing is at least
quite certain: we can do nothing about it. Any form of activity must be
as futile and as fatuous as any other; and the only sensible philosophy
must be “Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.”<br />
Is there a conceivable alternative?<br />
Well, consider the cause of the impending collapse. It is quite simple:
Knowledge is loose, without control of Will and of Intelligence. (How
clearly the Qabalah states and demonstrates this doctrine! But I musn’t
be naughty; let me stick to Common Sense!)<br />
Now, these qualities in us having failed to measure up to the situation
of the world, one hope remains; to get into communication with those
“gods” or “masters” whose existence was demonstrated in my Premise Major
and learn from Them.<br />
But is this possible?<br />
Tradition and experience unite to assert that it is so; moreover,
various forms of technique for accomplishing this are at our disposal.
This is what is called The Great Work; and it is abundantly clear that
no other aim is worth pursuit.<br />
So much for the argument; it will be agreed readily enough that to put
it into practice we shall need an Alphabet, a Grammar and a Dictionary.
Follow the Axioms, the Postulates, the Theorems; finally, the
Experiments.<br />
And that is what all these letters are about.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-lxxviii-sore-spots">Chapter LXXVIII: Sore Spots</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>Three in one and one in three—it’s the Athanasian Creed in the Black
Mass—eh! What’s that you say?<br />
Oh, quite right, quite, quite right of you to remind me. “Definition
first!”<br />
A “sore spot” is one which reacts abnormally and violently, however
gently you touch it; more, all the other bits of you give a painful
jerk, however disconnected they may seem. Still more, the entire System
undergoes a spasm of apprehension; and the total result is that the
mental as well as the physical system is quite unable to grasp the
situation with any accuracy, and the whole man is temporarily engulfed
in what is naturally not far from a condition of insanity.<br />
(Now, Athanasius! It’s all right; the lady has gone away to think it
over.)<br />
In—shall I say “Anglo-Saxondom,” or “Teutonic breeds,” or “bourgeoisie,”
so as to include some of the French whom when they are good are very
good indeed, but when they are bad, they are horrid?—the presiding
God/Gods of this Trinity is/are: 1. Sex, 2. Religion, 3. “Drugs;” and
the greatest of these is Sex, actually the main root of which the other
two are tough and twisted stems, each with its peculiar species of
poisonous flowers, sometimes superficially so attractive that their
nastiness passes for Beauty.<br />
I shall leave it to the psychoanalysts to demonstrate the reduction to
Sex, merely remarking that though I agree with their analysis as far as
it goes, I do not allow it to stop where they do.<br />
For us, Sex is the first unconscious manifestation of Chiah, the
Creative Energy; and although (like everything else) it is shown both on
the spiritual and the physical planes, its most important forthshowing
is on the “Magical” plane, because it actually produces phenomena which
partake of all these. It is the True Will on the creative plane: “By
Wisdom formed He the worlds.” So soon as its thaumaturgy is
accomplished, it is, through Binah, understood as the Logos. Thus in Sex
we find every one of the primary Correspondences of Chokmah. Being thus
ineffable and sacrosanct, it is (plainly enough) peculiarly liable to
profanation. Being profaned, it is naturally more unspeakably nasty than
any other of the “Mysteries.” You will find a good deal on this subject
implied in Artemis Iota, attached to another of my letters to you.<br />
Before tackling “Sore Spots” seriously, there is after all, one point
which should be made clear as to this Trinitarian simplification.<br />
One of the most interesting and fruitful periods of my life was when I
was involved in research as to the meaning of Sankhara: “tendencies” may
be, indeed is, a good enough translation, but it leaves one very much as
deeply in the dark as before. You remember—I hope!—that Sankhara lies
between Vinnanam, Pure Consciousness, and Sanna, Perception. For
instance, an electric fan in motion: a house-fly “tends” to see the
vanes as we do when they are still, we “tend” to see a diaphanous
blur.<br />
Then, in delirium tremens, why do we tend to see pink rats rather than
begonias or gazelles?<br />
We tend to see the myriad flashing colours of the humming bird; the bird
itself does not; it has no apparatus of colour-sense; to him all appears
a neutral tint, varying only in degrees of brightness.<br />
Such were some of the fundamental facts that directed the course of my
research, whose results you may read in “The Psychology of Hashish”, by
Oliver Haddo in The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 2. The general basis of this
Essay is Sankhara; it shows how very striking are the analogies between,
(1) the results obtained by Mystics—this includes the Ecstasy of Sexual
Feeling, as you may read in pretty nearly all of them, from
St. Augustine to St. Teresa and the Nun Gertrude. The stages recounted
by the Buddha in his psychological analyses correspond with almost
incredible accuracy. (2) The phenomena observed by those who use opium,
hashish, and some other “drugs” (3) The phenomena of various forms of
insanity.<br />
The facts of this research are infuriating to the religious mystic; and
the fact of its main conclusion is liable to drive him into so delirious
a frenzy of rage as to make one reach for one’s notebook—one more
typical extreme case!<br />
Now of course very few religious persons know that they are
mystics—already it annoys them to suggest it!—but, whether the lady doth
protest too much, or too little, the fact is that they are. There is no
true rational meaning in religion. Consider the Athanasian Creed
itself!<br />
Observe that the rationalist dare not yield a millionth of a
millimetre.<br />
“First cut the Liquefaction, what comes next<br />
But Fichte’s clever cut at God himself? . . .<br />
The first step, I am master not to take:”<br />
says Bishop Blougram, and is pinned to the cork labelled
“St. Januarius”!<br />
This dilemma, consciously or subconsciously, is well rooted in the minds
of everybody who takes Life, in any one of its forms, seriously. He
feels the touch of the rapier, however shrewdly or cautiously wielded.
The salute itself is more than enough; he feels already the thrust to
his vitals.<br />
I remember sailing happily in to breakfast at Camberwell Vicarage, and
saying cheerfully, in absolute good faith: “A fine morning, Mr Kelly!” I
was astounded at the reply. The dear old gentleman—and he really was one
of the best!—half choked, then gobbled at me like a turkey! “You’re a
very insolent young man!” Poor, tiny Aleister! How was I to know that
his son had driven it well home that the hallmark of English stupidity
was that the only safe topic of conversation was the weather. And so my
greeting was instantly construed as a deliberate insult!<br />
A typical example of the irrationality of the reactions of a
sufferer!<br />
Now, from this schoolboy level, let us rise and put the case a little
more strongly. Let us quit the shallows of social backchat for the
gloomy and horrific abysses of a murder trial!<br />
To every man and woman that has not seen Sex as it is, faced it,
mastered it—you will find elsewhere in these letters sufficient on this
matter—it is his secret guilt. Imagine, then, how at any reference
however remote, the “sinner” quails, his inmost mystery laid bare, his
evil conscience holding up a tarnished mirror to his deformed and
hideous face!” Often enough, he does not mind gross jests which admit
complicity on the part of the other; but any allusion to the Truth, and
his soul shrieks: I am found out!” Then apoplectic Fear puts on the mask
of Indignation and Disgust.<br />
As for a serious discussion of anything concerned therewith, why, every
word is a new rasping tear.<br />
The mind takes refuge in irrational and irrelevant outbursts of feigned
rage and horror.<br />
In the case of religion, the consciousness of guilt extended to cover
everything from “playin’ chuchfarden on the bless‚d tombstones” to “the
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.” Against this vague and monstrous
bogey, religion is the only safeguard, and therefore to suggest the
unsoundness of the guarantee is to strike at the roots of all security.
It is like hinting to some besotted and uxorious oldster, that his young
wife may be unfaithful. It is the poison that Iago dripped so skilfully
into the long hairy ear of the dull Moor. So he reacts
irrationally—every bush conceals a bear—nay, more likely a Boojum,1 or a
Bunyip,2 or some other creature of fear-spurred Imagination!
“Monstrum<br />
informe, ingens, horrendum.”3 Note well the “informe.”<br />
And because the guarantee is unsound (and must be, or where would be the
point of “Faith”?) reassurance is in the nature of things impossible.
Like the demented rider in The Erl-King, the chase goes ever wilder and
wilder, until he plunges at the end into the bottomless bog of madness
and destruction.<br />
I wonder how many lunatics there are in the “bughouse” to-day—in the
times of “evangelical revival” the number was fantastic—who got there
through fear that they had somehow committed the aforesaid “blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost.” The unknown again. The Bible does not tell us
that it is; only that it is unpardonable. Nor Grace, nor Faith, nor
predestination avail in the least; for all you know, you may have
committed it. Reassurance is impossible; no ceinture de chastetée‚
avails to avert this danger.<br />
Again with drugs, it is the unknown which is the horrific factor. Most
people get their information on the subject from the yellowest of yellow
newspapers, magazines and novels. So darkly deep is their ignorance that
that do not know what the word means—like us so often, yes?<br />
Wide sections of the U.S.A. are scared of tea and coffee. They blench
when you point out that bicarbonate of soda is a drug just as much as
cocaine; at the same time they literally shovel in the really dangerous
Aspirin, to say nothing of the thousand Patent Medicines blared at them
from every radio—as if the Press were not enough to poison the whole
population! B lank-eyed, they gasp when they learn that of all classes,
the first place among “drug addicts” is that of the doctor.<br />
But the crisis in which fear becomes phobia is the unreasoning aversion,
the shuddering of panic, above all, the passionate refusal to learn
anything about “drugs,” to analyse the conditions, still less to face
them; and the spasmodic invention of imaginary terrors, as if the real
dangers were not enough to serve as a warning.<br />
Now why? Surely because in the sub-conscious lies an instinct that in
these obscure medicines indeed lies the key of some forbidden sanctuary.
There is a fascination as irrational and therefore as strong, as the
fear. Here is the point at which they link up with sex and religion. Oh,
how well-nigh almighty is the urgency to him who reads those few great
writers who understood the subject from experience:<br />
de Quincey, Ludlow, Poe and Baudelaire: into whom burn the pointed
parallels between their adventures and those of all the mystics, East
and West!<br />
The worst of this correspondence-form is that you are always asking
simple elementary questions which require half a dozen treatises to
answer: so, take this, with my blessing!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>P.S. One further reflection. With all these “sore spots” is closely
linked the idea of cruelty. I need not touch upon the relation of
cruelty to sex; the theme has been worn threadbare. But in religion,
note the Bottomless Pit and the Eternal Flame; in Buddhism, the eighteen
hot and eighteen cold Hells, with many another beneath. Hindu
eschatology has countless Hells; even pedestrian, precise Islam, and the
calculating Qabalists, each boast of Seven. Again with drugs as with
insanity, we are confronted constantly with nameless terrors; the idea
of formlessness, of infinity pervades them alike. Consider the man who
takes every chance gesture of a stranger in the street as a secret sign
passed from one of his persecutors to another; consider those who refuse
food because of the mysterious conspiracy to poison them.<br />
All sanity, which is all Science, is founded upon Limit. We must be able
to cut off, to define, to measure. Naturally, then, their opposites,
Insanity and Religion, have for their prime characteristic, the
Indefinable, Incomprehensible, Immeasurable.<br />
The healing virtue of these words is this: examine the sore spot,
analyse it, probe it; then disinfection and the Vis Medicatrix Naturae,
complete the cure.<br />
I had just finished this when in comes your very pertinent
“Supplementary”” Postcard. “Doesn’t hypocrisy fit in here, somehow?”
Indeed it does, my child!<br />
Corresponding to, and the poison bacillus of, that centre of infection,
is a Trinity of pure Evil, the total abnegation of Thelema. Well known
to the psycho-analyst: the name thereof Shame—Guilt—Fear.<br />
The Anglo-Saxon or bourgeois mentality is soaked therein; and his remedy
so far from our exploratory-disinfection method, is to hide the
gangrened mass with dirty poultices. He has always a text of Scripture
or some other authority to paint his foulest acts in glowing colours;
and if he wants a glass of beer, he hates the stuff, but —doctor’s
orders, my boy, doctor’s orders.—There is really nothing new to be said
about hypocrisy; it has been analysed, exposed, lashed by every great
Artist; quite without effect. It gets worse as the socialistic idea
thrives, as the individual leans ever harder on the moral support of the
herd.<br />
Here is a most pertinent story from I Write as I Please by my old
friend, Walter Duranty. It shows how the sentimental point of view
blinds its addicts to the most obvious facts.<br />
“My friend Freddy Lyon . . . told me a story . . . of the Volga Famine.
Some A.R.A. ‘higher-ups’ from New York were making a tour of inspection
. . . Among them was a worthy but sentimental citizen who gushed about
the unhappy Russians and the poor little starving children and what a
privilege it was for Mr Lyon to be doing this noble work for humanity
and so on and so forth until Lyon said he was ready to choke him . . .
After lunch the visitors suggested they would like to visit the
cemetery.<br />
It was, said Freddy, a horrid sight, nude, dead bodies piled up ten high
like faggots, because the population was so destitute that every stitch
of clothing was needed for the living. The visitors were sickened by
what they saw, and even the gushing one was silent as they walked back
to the cemetery gate. Suddenly he caught Freddy by the arm. ‘Look
there!’ he said, ‘Is not that something to restore our faith in the
goodness of God in the midst of all these horrors?’ He pointed to a big
woolly dog lying asleep on a grave with his head between his paws, and
continued impressively. ‘Faithful unto death and beyond. I have often
heard of a dog refusing to be comforted when his master died, lying
desolate on his grave, but I never thought to see such a thing my-
self.’ That was too much for Freddy Lyon. ‘Yes,’ he said cruelly, ‘but
look at the dog’s paws and muzzle’—they were stiff with clotted
blood—‘he’s not mourning his master, he’s sleeping off a meal.’ ‘At
which point,’ Lyon concluded his story with gusto, ‘that talkative guy
did the opposite of sleeping off his lunch in a very thorough manner,
and there wasn’t another peep out of him until we put him on the
train.’”<br />
P.P.S. Here is a very different set of reactions. I do not quite know
why I am putting it in; is it some sub-conscious attraction of my own?
Anyhow, here it is; call it LA POULE AUX RATS<br />
Time: a fine Sunday evening in June, just one and twenty years ago.
Place: Paris, just off the Place des Tertres, overlooking the city. A
large and lovely studio, panelled in oak. Strange: it was completely
bare, and so far as one could see, it had no door. The skylights,
mindful, were carefully screened with broidered stuff. A gallery, some
ten feet from the floor, ran round one corner. Here was a buffet loaded
with priceless wines and liquors of all sorts—except the “soft”—and
excellent variety of all cold “snack” refreshments. One gained it by a
staircase from the lower floor.<br />
By the buffet, the old butler: oh, for a painter to portray his
Weariness of Evil Wisdom! Our host led us to the gallery; “we ate and
drank and saw” not God also, but the lady responsible for the heavy
tread upon the stairs. A woman of the Halles Centrales, in her early
forties; coarse, brutal, ugly, robust, square-set, curiously radiant
with some magnetic form of energy.<br />
I cannot describe her clothes—for lack of material. She greeted us all
round with a sort of surly good humour. The butler took a pot of very
far-gone Roquefort cheese, and smeared her all over. She drank to us,
and clumped away downstairs. She came out into the studio from under the
gallery, braced herself and shook her mop of hair as if about to
wrestle, waved to us and waited.<br />
A minute later a small trap at the far end of the studio was smartly
pulled up; in rushed a hundred starving rats. There was a moment’s
hesitation; but the smell of the cheese was too much, and they rushed
her. She caught one in both hands, bit through its spine, and flung it
aside.<br />
Softly repeating to myself passages from The Revenge by the late Alfred
Lord Tennyson, of which the scene most powerfully reminded me. “Rat
after rat, for half an hour, flung back as fast as it came.”<br />
Their courage wilted; the hunted became the huntress; I thought of
Artemis as I sang softly to myself, “When the hounds of spring are on
winter’s traces.”4 But she pursued; snapped the last spine, and flung it
into the gallery with a yell of triumph.<br />
It was not so easy a victory as I have perhaps described it, once she
slipped in the slime and came down with a thud; and at the end blood
spurted from innumerable bites.<br />
The whole scene was too much for most of the men; they literally howled
liked famished wolves, and shook the balustrade until it creaked and
groaned. Presently one slipped over, let himself lightly to the floor
and charged. Others followed. All had their heart’s desire. I was
reminded of Swinburn’s Laus Veneris,</p>
<p>“I let mine eyes have all their will of thee<br />
I seal myself upon thee with my might.”</p>
<p>As for the women, the ferocious glitter of their eyes was almost
terrifying. One of them, true, would have joined the happy warriors
below; but the butler roughly pulled her back, saying in a shocked
voice, “Madame est normale.” (I enjoyed that!) Others consoled
themselves by capturing those males who were too timid to risk the
jump.<br />
I swallowed a last glass of champagne, and then “je filai a
l’Anglais.”Summary: a pleasant time was had by all.<br />
Note for political economists: the woman took 10,000 francs (at about
125 to the £); she took three weeks in hospital and three weeks’ holiday
between the shows. She was, or had been, the mistress of a Minister with
“peuple” ideas, though he was an aristocrat of very old vintage; and he
helped her to have her daughters brought up in one of the most exclusive
convents in France.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Kenneth Grant, who was doing secretarial work for Crowley around the
time some of the letters in Magick Without Tears were written, later
printed in his Remembering Aleister Crowley (London: Skoob, 1991) some
material originally intended for this letter which he had written down
in a notebook and then misplaced:</p>
<p>Motto for “Sore Spots”</p>
<p>“Il n’appartient vraiment qu’aux races dégradées<br />
D’avoir lâchment peur des faits et des idées.”<br />
“Appelez bien plûtot sur ce qui vous effraie<br />
Le jour qui rétablit la proportion vraie<br />
Et dépouille l’object, à lui-mê,e réduit,<br />
De l’aspect colossal que lui prêtait la nuit.”</p>
<p>Ponsard. Charlotte Corday. Prologue.</p>
<p>Insert in “Sore Spots.”</p>
<p>Here is a case in point from recent experience. In my play “The Three
Wishes” one of the characters is a rich selfish woman who has exhausted
every source of vicious pleasure. In here abject despair her last
resource is addiction to morphine.<br />
I gave the play to an actor, a man of the highest intelligence and the
broadest views on life; he said that I could not hope to get a play
licensed if it dealt with drugs, unless as a warning against their
abuse—which is exactly what the play imports. The mere mention of
morphine had so disturbed his judgement that he failed to realize that
fact.<br />
He interpreted her abject wail, the cynical cry of a damned soul, as a
defiant assertion of compensation for her disappointments in all
else.<br />
The mere mention! There is not a line in the whole play to support any
advocacy or excuse for her suicidal habit.</p>

2: “According to Australian aboriginal folk-lore, a man-eating bellowing
monster who drags his victims down to the bottom of the lake or swamp
that he inhabits. It is also used to mean an ‘impostor’.”(Brewer’s

<h3 id="chapter-lxxix-progress">Chapter LXXIX: Progress</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>You will certainly have to have an India-rubber medal for
persistence: this is the nth time that you have tried to catch me
contradicting myself.<br />
Well, so I do, and must, every time I make any statement whatever, as
has been shown several times in this chatty little interchange of views.
But that is not what you mean.<br />
You say—permit me to condense your more than somewhat tautological,
pleonastic, prolix, diffuse and incoherent lucubrations!—that the whole
idea of the Great Order is based on faith in Progress.<br />
The doctrine of successive aeons is nothing else. The system of training
is nothing else. Nothing, in fact, is anything else. Maugr‚ this and in
despite thereof (you continue, with a knavish gleam in your hither eye)
I am everlastingly throwing down the whole jerry-built castle by my
cynical reflections.<br />
(Some one—Anthony Hope in a lucid moment, I think—says that cynicism is
always a confession of failure—“sour grapes.”) Maybe, some of the time.
But the explanation is very simple, and you ought to have been able to
think it out for yourself. It is a question of the “Universe of
Discourse,” of Perspective. An engineer may swear himself ultra-marine
in the map all the time at the daily mistakes and mishaps that go on all
the time under his nose, yet at dinner tell his friends complacently
that the bridge is going up better than he ever expected.<br />
Just so, my gibes are directed at incidents; but my heart’s truth is
fixed on the grand spiral.<br />
All the same, I am glad you wrote; it is a text for a little sermon that
I have had in mind for a long while on the conditions of progress.<br />
Number One is obviously Irregularity, Eccentricity, Disorder, the
Revolutionary Spirit, Experiment.<br />
I have no patience whatever with Utopia-mongers. Biology simply shouts
at us that the happy contented community, everyone with his own (often
highly specialised) job, nobody in need, nobody in danger, is
necessarily stagnant. Termites and other ants, bees, beavers; these and
many another have produced perfect systems. What is the first
characteristic? Stupidity. “Where there is no vision, the people shall
perish.” What is the Fighter Termite to do, after he has been blocked
out of his home? None of these communities possess any resource at all
against any unforeseen unfavourable change of circumstance. (We look
rather like that just now at the end of 1944 e.v.) Nor does anyone of
them show any achievement; having got to the end of their biological
tether, they stay out, without an aim, an idea, an effort. The leech, an
insufferable pest in its belt —it has killed off tiger, rhinoceros,
anything with a nostril!—is the curse of our military station at
Lebong—or was when I was there. At Darjeeling, a few hundred feet
higher, devil a one! They have no one to think: now how can we flourish
up higher? Those old forlorn-hope Miss-Sahibs—how wide are their
nostrils! Then—how?<br />
Consider for a moment our own Empire. How did that spread all over the
planet? It was the imaginative logic, the audacity, the adroit
adaptability, of the Adventurer that blasted the road.<br />
The sunny Socialist smiles his superior smile, and condescends to
instruct us. That was an unfortunate, though perhaps sometimes
necessary, stage in the perfection of Society.<br />
Something in that. But there are other kinds of Adventure. My
imagination can set no limit to the possibilities of Science, or of Art:
our own Great Work is evidence of that.<br />
Last Sunday I looked through an interview with the least brain-bound of
these ruminators—poor old, dear old G. for gaga Bernard Shaw.<br />
The artist, said he, was a special case. He should have a nice easy job,
three or four hours a day, and be free for the rest of it to devote
himself to his Art. I wonder how much of his own work would have seen
daylight if he had been tied to some silly robot soul-killing, nerve-
crushing, mind-infuriating routine job for even one half-hour a day!
When I am on a piece of work, I grudge the time for eating; and when
it’s done, I need the absolute relaxation of leisured luxury.<br />
Then what of the Work itself? If the Idea be truly new and important,
God help it! The whole class of men affected jump on it with one accord,
if haply they may crush it in the germ. Read a little of the History of
Medicine! Any man who shows a sign of independent thought is watched, is
thwarted. He persists and is threatened and bullied. He persists; every
engine of oppression is set in motion against him. Then something snaps;
either they succeed in killing him (Ross, who defeated malaria, nearly
starved to death) or they make him a baronet, or a peer, or make his
death a Day of National Mourning, and bury him in the Pantheon—“auc
grands hommes la patrie reconnaissante”—like Pasteur after one of the
most infamous campaigns of persecution in history.<br />
Then, of course, entertainment must be standardised. It costs money to
produce; and who will produce anything which can only appeal to the very
few—to none at all, soon, if these swine have their way. So, if it is
new, is original, is worth one’s while, it must be ignored.<br />
Besides, being new and incomprehensible to the great Us, it may be
dangerous, and must be suppressed.<br />
In all literature I know no pages so terrifying as those in Louis
Marlow’s Mr Amberthwaite, which describe his dream. I wish I could quote
it, with Sinai as the orchestra; never mind, read it again.<br />
And we are on the way—far on the way—to That!<br />
Now, obviously, the robot education, robot textbooks stuffed in by robot
teachers, will have done wonders with the help of the bovine well-being
to produce a race of robot boys.<br />
All independence, all imagination, all spirit of Adventure, will have
been ground down and rolled out smooth by this ghastly engine.
But—Nature is not so easily beaten; a few boys and girls will somehow
escape, and either by instinct or by<br />
observation, have the sense to keep secret. Now whatever their own
peculiar genius may select as their line, they will realise that nothing
is possible in any way while the accursed system stands. Their first
duty is Revolt. And presently someone will come along with the wit and
the will and the weapon, and blow the whole most damnable bag of tricks
sky-high.<br />
We had better busy ourselves about this while it is still possible to
get back to freedom without universal bloodshed.<br />
“All right, Master, you win! Now give us your own idea of Utopia.”<br />
An Utopia to end Utopias? Very good, so I will. Education, to begin
with; well, you’ve had all that in another letter. The main thing to
remember is that I want every individual taught as such, according to
his own special qualities. Then, teach them both sides of every
question: history, for example, as the play of economic forces, also, as
due to the intervention of Divine Providence, or of “Sports” of genius:
and so for the rest. Train them to doubt—and to dare!<br />
Then, somehow, as large a number of the most promising rebels should be
selected to lead a life of luxury and leisure. Let every country, by
dint of honouring its old traditions, be as different as possible from
every other. Restore the “Grand tour,” or rather, the roving Englishman
of the Nineteenth Century. Entrust them with the secrets of discipline,
of authority, or power. Hardship and danger in full measure: and
responsibility.<br />
A great deal of such material will be as disgustingly wasted as it has
been in the past; and there will be much abuse of privilege. But this
must be allowed and allowed for; no very great harm will result, as the
weak and vicious will weed themselves out.<br />
The pure gold will repay us ten thousand fold. You ask examples? With
us, the Elizabethan and the Victorian periods stand out. What is most
wanted is opportunity and reward. Under Victoria there was some—taste
the late Samuel Smiles Esquire, D.D. (wasn’t he?)—but not enough, and
Industrialism, the mother and nurse of Socialism, was destroying the
soul of the people.<br />
In my not very maternal remarks on Mother-love, was included the
substance of the one wise saying of my pet American lunatic “You can’t
get past their biology.” This is so true, and so disheartening, that it
arouses me to combat. Must we for ever be bound to the inconvenient
habit of sows and cabbages? I pick up the glove.<br />
Isn’t it Aldous Huxley who says somewhere that some species or other can
never develop higher powers because its brain is shut in by its
carapace? I thought this too, long ago; and I went into interminable
conferences with my old friend, Professor Buckmaster; I wanted to extend
brain surgery to produce the phenomena of Yoga. Also, I wondered what
would happened if we wedged apart the sections of the cranium at, or
shortly after, birth, so as to prevent them closing and giving the brain
a chance to grow.<br />
I suspect, by the way, that something of the sort is done in China and
Burma; but the object is merely to produce megalocephalic idiots as a
valuable addition to the financial resources of the family.<br />
I thought that modern physiology, with its great recent advances in
knowledge of the specialised functions of the brain, might quite
possibly succeed in producing genius.<br />
You would not surprise me if you told me that something of the sort is
being tried in Russia, with its Communism modelled so closely on that of
Ivan the Terrible at the moment, war or no war! Qui vivra verra.<br />
Anyhow, all that I really want you to get into your head “sunning over
with little curls” is that Progress demands Anarchy tempered by Common
Sense, and that the most formidable obstacle is this Biology.<br />
The experience of the Magician and the Yogi does suggest that there is
room in the human brain as at present constituted for almost limitless
expansion. At least our system of Training is more immediately practical
than digging up our Corpora Quadragenina and planting them in a Monkey’s
Medulla just to see what will come of it. So put down that
bread-knife!</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>666</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxxx-life-a-gamble">Chapter LXXX: Life a Gamble</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>In one or two—no, I think more like three or four—letters of yours to
hand in the last couple of months, you have put forward various excuses
for slackness, the necessities of your economic situation. You say you
must have “regular work,” and a “steady income” and all that sort of
thing.<br />
My innocent child, that species of Magick is quite simple. Take the
horns of a hare . . . That’s enough for the present: I’ll tell you what
to do with them when you’ve got them.<br />
In Macbeth we read—</p>
<p>.. . . “Security<br />
Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.”</p>
<p>but this is another kind of security; it is the Hubris which “tempts
Providence,” the insolence of thinking that nothing can go wrong.<br />
Anyhow, there’s no such thing as safety. Life is a gamble. From the
moment of incarnation a million accidents are possible. Miscarriage,
still-birth, abortion; throughout life, until your heart beats for the
last time, “you never can tell” – — — — and then you start all over
again with your next incarnation!<br />
(I wish I had a copy of a short story of mine called “Every Precaution.”
The gallant young Uplift Expert, the one hundred per cent red-blooded,
clean-living, heir of the Eternities, takes his young fiancée and female
counterpart to the “Old Absinthe House” in New Orleans to show her the
terrible results of Wrong-Doing. They are going to avoid all that; their
child is going to be the Quintessence<br />
of Americanism.<br />
They marry and take a cottage by Lake Pasquaney. Presently, he being (so
she said) away on a business trip, the tradesmen complained that she
seemed to need very little pabulum. Somehow, people got suspicious, and
sure enough, when they broke in, they found that she had pickled
him!<br />
This story is founded on fact; damn it, why did the MS have to get
lost?)<br />
Even suicide is not a “dead bird.” I knew a creature once—careless
observers often mistook him of a man—who tried three times, pistol, rope
and poison. Something always went wrong. (Like the Babbacombe murderer,
who went to the scaffold three times, and lived to a green old age!)
Finally he did poison himself, by accident, when he had no intention
whatever of doing anything of the sort.<br />
Where’s the Book of Lies? Ah, here we are. “It is Pure Chance that rules
the Universe; therefore, and only therefore, life is good.”1<br />
Then, is it mere fatuity and folly to make plans? Was not the IXth Atu,
the Hermit, also at one time called “Prudence?”2 Of course. Abstract
philosophy rarely coincides with common-sense. We should plan as
carefully as we can; but we should always allow a margin for every
conceivable accident.<br />
Nor should we trust to luck, like England, when she goes to war. Bret
Harte has an admirable story “The Outcasts of Poker Flat in which
the”bad man,” the crooked gambler, gives his life for the safety of the
rest of his party, and winds up all with the remark: “Life isn’t in
having the luck of the cards, but in playing a poor hand well.”<br />
Yes, I daresay, all very fine; but what you wanted to know was about the
propriety of taking risks in Magick.<br />
So off we go.<br />
Risks, we have agreed, are always unavoidable; but we can calculate
them. The best and wisest man I ever knew, the late Oscar Eckenstein,
was once offered a job which gave him a fifty percent chance of
survival. He calmly sat down, worked out his “expectation of life,” his
“expectation of income,” and the Lord alone knows what other factors. It
came out that the pay offered was a thousand pounds or so less than he
might expect normally, so he turned down the offer. Not a trace of
sentiment of any kind!<br />
Now let us consider an “A.B. case.” John Jeremiah Jenkins sees a short
cut to his performance of the Great work. To seize this opportunity, he
must give up a steady job with good prospects and as near safety as is
possible in the nature of things, for a slim chance of a career in the
most insecure of all the professions.<br />
He can do it; that is at the mercy of his Will; but he risks something
very close to the utter wreck and ruin of his future. Only a miracle can
bring him through. Just so! But is he not neglecting one factor in his
problem? Who put this romantically insane opportunity in his way? The
Gods: it must be, since he is performing the Great Work. Very well then!
It is up to Them to watch: “he shall give his angels charge over thee to
keep thee in all thy ways: in their hands they shall bear thee up lest
thou dash thy foot against a stone.”<br />
What’s more, he must leave it at that; he must not insult Them by
constantly looking out for extra safeguards, or “hedging.” (You remember
the Major in The Suicide Club when Prince Florizel was picking seconds
for a duel? “In all my life I never so much as hedged a bet.”) You must
give Them plenty of opportunity to show Their approval by steering you
miraculously through one crisis after another.<br />
This course of conduct may seem to you a little like the “Act of Truth”
but this is only superficially the case. The latter is usually an
emergency measure, and either not particularly serious or as serious as
anything can be. But what I have said above amounts really to a regular
Rule of Life.<br />
Need I add that the prime and essential requisite in all this Work is
that you so devote yourself to, and identify yourself with, the Gods,
that there is never any doubt in your mind as to what They intend you to
do?</p>

from it was slightly misquoted; the quote is here conformed to the
second edition of The Book of Lies – T.S.<br />

referred to Tarot Trumps: Justice, Fortitude (also known as Strength)
and Temperence (though Waite, in a note to Levi’s Dogme et Rituel,
suggests the attribution of Prudence to Atu IX was an invention of
Levi’s to complete the scheme; an alternative but somewhat strained
suggestion has Atu XX as ‘prudential judgement’). It may or may not be
significant that when reformulating the Tarot in The Book of Thoth
Crowley changed the names of all three of these – T.S.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-lxxxi-method-of-training">Chapter LXXXI: Method of
Training</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>In your well-worn copy of the Bagh-i-muattar you have no doubt triply
underlined that great verse:<br />
“Who hath the How is careless of the Why,” which shows how cunning I was
to induce you to put all your “why” questions first. But now let us get
down to orichalc taques, as the Norman peasant might say.<br />
The first and absolutely essential task for the Aspirant is to write his
Magical Record.<br />
You know some elementary Mechanics—the Triangle of Forces, and all that.
Well, if we have a body acted on by two equal forces, one pulling it
east, the other south, it will tend to move in a southEasterly
direction. But if the “south” force is (say) twice as strong, it will
move south of South-East.<br />
Now you, sitting in your study reading this letter, got there and were
compelled to do that, as the result of the impact upon you of countless
quintillions of forces of every kind. I don’t expect you to discover all
these and calculate and report them; but I want you to set down all the
main currents.<br />
For so you should be able to get some sort of answer to the question
Where do we go from here, boys?<br />
I am not a guesser; and I cannot judge you, or advise you, or help you,
unless and until I know the facts as thoroughly as you are able to allow
me to do.<br />
The construction of this Record is, incidentally, the first step in the
practice called Sammasati, and leads to the acquisition of the Magical
Memory—the memory of your previous incarnations. So there is another
reason, terrifically cogent, for writing this Magical Record as clearly
and as fully as you can.<br />
This best explanation of how to set about the task is given in Liber
Thisharb. Some of this sounds rather advanced and technical; but it
ought to give you the general idea. You should begin with your parents
and the family traditions; the circumstances of your birth and
education; your social position; your financial situation; your
physique, health, illnesses; your vita sexualis; your hobbies and
amusements; what you are good at, what not; how you came to be
interested in the Great Work; what (if you have been on false trails,
Toshophists, Anthroposophagists, sham Rosicrucians, etc.) has been “your
previous condition of servitude;” how you found me, and decided to
enlist my aid.<br />
That, by itself, helps you to understand yourself, and me to understand
you.<br />
From that point the keeping of the Record is quite easy. All you have to
do is to put down what practices you mean to begin, how you get on with
them from day to day, and (at intervals) what I have to say about your
progress.<br />
Remember always that we have no use for piety, for vague chatter, for
guesswork; we are as strictly scientific as biologists or
chemists.<br />
We ban emotion from the start; we demand perception; and (as you will
see later on) even perception is not acceptable until we have made sure
of its bases by a study of what we call the “tendencies.”<br />
That is all about the Magical Record; the way is now clear to set forth
our Method. This is two-fold.<br />
(1) Yoga, introversion, (2) Magick, extroversion. (These are rough but
useful connotations.) The two seem, at first glance, to be opposed; but,
when you have advanced a little in both, you find that the concentration
learnt in Yoga is of immense use in attaining the mental powers
necessary in magick; on the other hand, the discipline of Magick is of
the greatest service in Yoga.<br />
Let me remark, by the way, that to my mind one of the greatest beauties,
and most encouraging confirmations of the validity of our system, is the
matchless harmony of its elements. Always, when we pursue any one path
to its end, we find that it has become one with some other path which at
the outset appeared utterly irreconcilable with it.<br />
(“Write down that the tearing apart is the crushing together” comes from
an actual experience. See Liber 418, The Vision and the Voice, which
teems with similar passages, and is itself an outstanding example of the
unity of the Yogic and the Magical methods.)<br />
To study Yoga, you have my Book 4 Part I and my Eight Lectures on Yoga.
Then there is Vivekananda’s Raja Yoga and several little-known Hindu
writers; these latter are very practical and technical, but one really
needs to be a Hindu to make much use of them. The former is very good
indeed, if your remember to switch off when he slides into sloppiness,
which luckily is not often.<br />
To study Magick, Book 4, Parts II, III (Magick in Theory and Practice)
and IV (The Equinox of the Gods.)1 Add The Book of Thoth and there you
are:—<br />
“Being furnished with complete armour and armed, he is similar to the
goddess.2<br />
Of other writers, you have The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the
Mage, and any of the works of Eliphas Lévi. But that’s all.<br />
But—I suppose you knew all this long ago. It may help if I try to
expound the essence of these two Methods in very simple language, and
very different language. By contrast and comparison, you should be able,
without reading even one of all those books, to get a perfectly clear
idea in perspective of”what’s coming to you!”<br />
The process of analysing, developing and controlling the mind is the
essence of all Yoga practices.<br />
Magick explores and learns to control those regions of Nature which lie
beyond the objects of sense.<br />
Reaching the highest parts of these regions, called the divine, one
proceeds by the exaltation (? = intoxication? Yes, of a sublime sort) of
the consciousness to identify oneself with those “celestial”
Beings.<br />
In Yoga, various practices prevent the body and its functions from
interrupting the mental process.<br />
Then, one inhibits that process itself: the stilling of “thoughts”
allows one to become aware of mental functions beyond the intellectual;
these functions have their own peculiar properties and powers.<br />
Each sheath, as one goes deeper, is discarded as “unreal;” finally one
apprehends that nothing which is the only true and real form of
existence. (But then it does not exist: in these regions of thought
words always become nightmares of self- contradiction. This is as it
should be.)<br />
In Magick, on the contrary, one passes through the veil of the exterior
world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes “unreal” by
comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument
is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and
controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of
what is called “initiation:” finally, one carries on almost one’s whole
life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of
the Universe.<br />
The first step in Yoga is “Keep still.”<br />
The first step in Magick is “Travel beyond the world of the
senses.”<br />
There, that is the whole business in a nutshell, and expressed so that
anyone, however ignorant of the subject, may grasp the essentials (I
hope).</p>

<p>Notes:<br />
1: For the whole history of the conception and execution of the monster
piece known as Book 4, see the editor’s introduction to the 1994 and
1997 Samuel Weiser edition, Magick: Book 4 parts I-IV, popularly known
as the “Blue Brick.” Crowley had originally intended part IV, “T…..—the
Law” to comprise The Book of the Law and his final commentary thereon.
Symonds and Grant erroneously identified it with the edition of the
commentaries which they edited (Magical and Philosophical Commentaries
on The Book of the Law, Montreal: 93 Publishing, 1974). The Equinox of
the Gods was not designated as part of Book 4 on first publication,
rather as Equinox vol. III no. 3; as far as I am aware, this letter of
MWT is the first published reference to it as Book 4 part IV –
T.S.<br />
2: A quote from the Chaldæan Oracles, as cited by Proclus in Platonic
Theology. Fragment 171 in the Westcott edition. The goddess in question
is probably Hekaté. Johnston in Hekate Soteira renders it “For I have
come, a goddess in full armour and with weapons,” making Hekaté herself
the speaker – T.S.</p>

LXXXII: Epistola Penultima: The Two Ways to Reality</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>How very sensible of you, though I admit somewhat exacting!<br />
You write—Will you tell me exactly why I should devote so much of my
valuable time to subjects like Magick and Yoga.<br />
That is all very well. But you ask me to put it in syllogistic form. I
have no doubt this can be done, though the task seems somewhat
complicated. I think I will leave it to you to construct your series of
syllogisms yourself from the arguments of this letter.<br />
In your main question the operative word is “valuable. Why, I ask, in my
turn, should you consider your time valuable? It certainly is not
valuable unless the universe has a meaning, and what is more, unless you
know what that meaning is—at least roughly—it is millions to one that
you will find yourself barking up the wrong tree.<br />
First of all let us consider this question of the meaning of the
universe. It is its own evidence to design, and that design intelligent
design. There is no question of any moral significance—”one man’s meat
is another man’s poison” and so on. But there can be no possible doubt
about the existence of some kind of intelligence, and that kind is far
superior to anything of which we know as human.<br />
How then are we to explore, and finally to interpret this
intelligence?<br />
It seems to me that there are two ways and only two. Imagine for a
moment that you are an orphan in charge of a guardian, inconceivably
learned from your point of view. Suppose therefore that you are puzzled
by some problem suitable to your childish nature, your obvious and most
simple way is to approach your guardian and ask him to enlighten you. It
is clearly part of his function as guardian to do his best to help you.
Very good, that is the first method, and close parallel with what we
understand by the word Magick. We are bothered by some difficulty about
one of the elements—say Fire—it is therefore natural to evoke a
Salamander to instruct you on the difficult point. But you must remember
that your Holy Guardian Angel is not only far more fully instructed than
yourself on every point that you can conceive, but you may go so far as
to say that it is definitely his work, or part of his work; remembering
always that he inhabits a sphere or plane which is entirely different
from anything of which you are normally aware.<br />
To attain to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel
is consequently without doubt by far the simplest way by which you can
yourself approach that higher order of being.<br />
That, then, is a clearly intelligible method of procedure. We call it
Magick.<br />
It is of course possible to strengthen the link between him and yourself
so that in course of time you became capable of moving and, generally
speaking, operating on that plane which is his natural habitat.<br />
There is however one other way, and one only, as far as I can see, of
reaching this state. It is at least theoretically possible to exalt the
whole of your own consciousness until it becomes as free to move on that
exalted plane as it is for him. You should note, by the way, that in
this case the postulation of another being is not necessary. There is no
way of refuting the solipsism if you feel like that. Personally I cannot
accede to its axiom. The evidence for an external universe appears to me
perfectly adequate.<br />
Still there is no extra charge for thinking on those lines if you so
wish.<br />
I have paid a great deal of attention in the course of my life to the
method of exalting the human consciousness in this way; and it is really
quite legitimate to identify my teaching with that of the Yogis.<br />
I must however point out that in the course of my instruction I have
given continual warnings as to the dangers of this line of research. For
one thing there is no means of checking your results in the ordinary
scientific sense. It is always perfectly easy to find a subjective
explanation of any phenomenon; and when one considers that the greatest
of all the dangers in any line of research arise from egocentric vanity,
I do not think I have exceeded my duty in anything that I have said to
deter students from undertaking so dangerous a course as Yoga. It is, of
course, much safer if you are in a position to pursue in the Indian
Jungles, provided that your health will stand the climate and also, I
must say, unless you have a really sound teacher on whom you can safely
rely. But then, if we once introduce a teacher, why not go to the
Fountain-head and press towards the Knowledge and conversation of the
Holy Guardian Angel?<br />
In any case your Indian teacher will ultimately direct you to seek
guidance from that source, so it seems to me that you have gone to a
great deal of extra trouble and incurred a great deal of unnecessary
danger by not leaving yourself in the first place in the hands of the
Holy Guardian Angel.<br />
In any case there are the two methods which stand as alternatives. I do
not know of any third one which can be of any use whatever. Logically,
since you have asked me to be logical, there is certainly no third way;
there is the external way of Magick, and the internal way of Yoga: there
you have your alternatives, and there they cease.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-lxxxiii-epistola-ultima">Chapter LXXXIII: Epistola
Ultima</h3>
<p>Cara Soror,</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>The suggestion in your last letter to me is a very sensible one. I do
think that people in general would like to get some idea of my system of
training as a whole, in a comprehensive form. In the past there has been
far too much of referring them to one quite unprocurable document and
then to another which probably has not even been written. No wonder that
they go away sorrowful. So I am going to put in as the last of this
series of Letters an account, as clear and as succinct as the gods
enable me to do, of what they may expect to have to do to get good marks
from Grandfather. Of course I shall not be able to avoid altogether
reference to the various official documents, but I will make these as
short and as few as I can.<br />
First of all then, my system can be divided into two parts. Apparently
diametrically opposed, but at the end converging, the one helping the
other until the final method of progress partakes equally of both
elements.<br />
For convenience I shall call the first method Magick, and the second
method Yoga. The opposition between these is very plain for the
direction of Magick is wholly outward, that of Yoga wholly inward.<br />
I will deal first then with Magick. How do I define this word?<br />
Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in accordance
with the will. (Obviously then all scientific methods can be included in
this term.)<br />
I have to assume in all that follows that you have thoroughly understood
the doctrine of 0 = 2.<br />
All Magical action may be classed as under the formula of progression
from the “0” to the “2”; in other words it is complete
extraversion.<br />
The aspiring Magician only analyses himself for the purpose of finding
new worlds to conquer. His first objective is the astral plane; its
discovery, the classification of its tenants, and their control.<br />
All his early practises therefore are devoted to exploring the worlds
which surround (if you choose, or if you prefer—are contained in) the
object of sense. If there is a tree in your garden, you want to find out
whether that tree is occupied by a nymph or a gnat, and if so, what are
they like? How do they act? How can you make them useful to your
purpose? It is in fact the ordinary every-day scientific method of
exploration. The only difference is that in the course of one’s
experiments one becomes aware of parts of the nature of the object to be
examined which are subtler and perhaps more powerful, nearer to reality,
than those which ordinary scientific examination discloses. You will
notice, however, that the qualities above-mentioned are identical. The
chemical elements which go to form a tree are subtler, more powerful and
nearer to reality than the tree as it is presented to the senses.<br />
Finally, we reach the conception of molecules, atoms, electrons,
protons, neutrons and so on, and nobody needs telling nowadays what
unfathomable potencies lie hidden in the atom.<br />
When I say subtler, moreover, I mean it. The analysis of matter has
resulted in the extraordinary discovery that the definition of matter as
given by the physicist of today is very similar indeed to the definition
of spirit as stated by the mystics of the middle ages.<br />
Henry Poincaré has well pointed out that the results of scientific
experiment as we know them, are altogether in their way dependant on the
existence of our own peculiar natures. If, for example, we had no sense
to use in our exploration but that of hearing, we should have worked out
a classification of trees entirely different from that which we now
possess. We should have taught our students how to distinguish the
sounds made by an oak and an elm respectively in a storm; the
differences in the rustling of various kinds of grass, and so on.<br />
Similarly the results of our magical experiments are naturally and
necessarily very distinct from those which we obtain by ordinary
methods. To begin with we must build up an apparatus of examination, and
this we do by discovering and developing qualities in our own structure
which ware suitable for the purpose.<br />
The first step is the separation of (what we call, for convenience) the
astral body from the physical body. As our experiments proceed, we find
that our astral body itself can be divided into grosser and subtler
components. In this way we become aware of the existence of what we
call, for convenience, the Holy Guardian Angel, and the more we realise
the implications of the theory of the existence of such a being, the
clearer it becomes that our supreme task is to put ourselves into
intimate communication with him.<br />
For one thing, we shall find that in the object of sense which we
examine there are elements which resist our examination. We must raise
ourselves to a plane in which we obtain complete control of such.<br />
It is found furthermore in the course of experiment that a great many of
the apparent differences in our study conceal a hidden unity, and vice
versa. Like every other science, both the subject and the object of the
work increase as that work proceeds.<br />
Take a simple matter like Mathematics as our analogy. The schoolboy
struggling with the Rule of Three is a very rudimentary image of the
advanced mathematician working on the differential calculus.<br />
From the above it ought to be clear to you that I have said all that
really needs to be said in explaining the whole of Magick as the science
and art of extending, first in oneself, one’s own faculties, secondly in
external nature their hidden characteristics.<br />
Before closing the subject entirely I think it well to point out that
there are quite a number of worlds on which a good deal of work remains
to be done. In particular I cannot refrain from mentioning the work of
Dr Dee and Sir Edward Kelly. My own work on this subject has been so
elaborate and extensive that I shall never sufficiently regret that I
never had an opportunity of completing it, but I should like to
emphasise that the obtaining of a book like Liber 41 is in itself so
outstanding an achievement that it should serve as an encouragement to
all Magicians.<br />
In the case of many worlds, in particular that of Abra Melin, of the
greater and lesser Keys of Solomon, of Pietro di Abano, of Cornelius
Agrippa, while we have perfectly adequate information as to the methods
we have very meagre examples of the results, especially so far as refers
to the technical side of the work.<br />
I must conclude with a warning. So many of these branches of magick are
so fascinating that any one of them is liable to take hold of the
Magician by the short hair and upset his balance completely.<br />
It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and
essential work of the Magicians is the attainment of the Knowledge and
Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he
must of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be
invariably and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great
step—crossing of the abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of
the Temple.<br />
Anything apart from this course is a side issue and unless so regarded
may lead to the complete ruin of the whole work of the Magician.<br />
The second part of this letter, which appears to be expanding into a
sort of essay, will be devoted to Yoga. You will have noticed that the
grade of Master of the Temple is itself intimately associated with<br />
Yoga. It is when one reaches this plane that the apparently
contradictory forms of the Great Work, Magick and Yoga, begin to
converge, though even earlier in the course of the work it must have
been noticed that achievements in Yoga have been of great assistance to
magical operations, and that many of the mental states necessary to the
development of the Magician are identical with those attained in the
course of the strictly technical Yogic operations.<br />
The literature necessary to the study of Magick is somewhat variegated;
there are quite a number of classics on the subject and though it would
be easy enough for me to draw up a list of not more than half-a dozen
which I consider really essential, there may be as many as an hundred
which in the more or less subsidiary forms are useful to the
magician.<br />
With Yoga the case is very different indeed. The literature on the
subject is so enormous and contains so vast a number of more or less
secret documents which circulate from hand to hand, that I believe that
the best advice I can give anyone is to cut one’s cloth very sparingly
if one is to make a fitting suit. I do not think I am going too far if I
say that Part I of Book 4 and my Eight Lectures on Yoga form an
absolutely sufficient guide to the useful practise of the subject;
anything else is almost certain to operate as a distraction.<br />
Swami Vivekananda summarised Yoga under four headings, and I do not
think that one can improve on that classification. His four are: Gnana,
Raja, Bhakti and Hatha, and comprise all divisions that it is desirable
to make. As soon as one begins to add such sections as Mantra Yoga, you
are adding to without enriching the classification, and once you begin
where are you to stop? But I honestly believe that the excessive
simplification given in Eight Lectures on Yoga is a practical advantage.
Any given type of Yoga is the work of a lifetime and for that reason
alone it is desirable to confine oneself from the beginning to an
absolutely simple programme.<br />
What then is the difference between Yoga and Magick? Magick is
extraversion, the discovery of and subsequently the classification of
and finally the control of new worlds on new planes. So far as it
concerns the development of the mind its object and method are perfectly
simple. What is wanted is exaltation. The aim is to identify oneself
with the highest essence of whatever world is under consideration.<br />
With Yoga you might easily slip into saying that it was identical, with
the exception that the new worlds are from the start recognised as
already existing within the human cosmos, but nobody is asked to extend
these worlds in any way; on the contrary the object is to analyse ever
more minutely, and the control to which one approaches is not external
but internal. At all times one is concentrated on the idea of
simplification. The recognition of any new idea or form of ideas, is
invariably the signal for its rejection: “not that, not that.”<br />
One might simplify this explanation by constructing some sort of
apophthegm; Magick is the journey from 0 to 2, Yoga from 2 to 0. It is a
very good rule for the Yogi to keep this mind constantly fixed on the
fact that any idea soever is false. There is actually a Hindu proverb
“That which can be thought is not true.” Consequently the existence of
any idea in the mind is an immediate refutation of it, but equally the
contraries as well as contradictory of that idea are false, and the
result of this is to knock the second law of formal logic to
pieces.<br />
One puts up a sort of sorites—A is B, therefore A is not B; therefore
not A is not B; and all these contrary statements are equally false, but
in order to realise this fact they must themselves be announced by the
mind as ecstatic discoveries of truth.<br />
The result of all this naturally is that the mind very rapidly becomes a
discredited instrument, and one attains to a totally different and much
more exalted type of mind, and the same destructive criticism which one
applied to the original consciousness applies equally to this higher
consciousness, and one gets to one higher still which is again
destroyed. In The Equinox, Vol. I there is an essay called “The soldier
and the Hunchback: ! And ?” In Liber Aleph too there are several
chapters about attainment by what is called the Method of
Ladders.2<br />
All these operations are equally valid and equally invalid, and the
result of this is that the whole subject of Yoga leads to constantly
increasing confusion. The fineness of the analytical instrument seems to
defeat its own purpose and it is perhaps because of that confession that
I have always felt in my deepest consciousness that the method of Magick
is on the whole less dangerous than that of Yoga. This is particularly
the case when discussing these matters with a Western mind.<br />
It is true that our 0 = 2 formula remains infinitely useful because it
is of such potency in destroying the scepticism which so often
disheartens one, especially in the highest realms of The criticism which
the enemy directs against your sun-kissed tower is thrown back from
those glittering walls. You accept the criticism at the same time as you
dismiss it with a laugh.<br />
On the whole therefore I continue to regard the discipline of Yoga as
its most valuable feature. The results attained by pushing Yoga to its
end are on their own showing worthless, whereas the attainment of
Magick, however lofty, is still immune to all criticism and at every
period of its construction has been perfectly sympathetic with the
normal consciousness of man.<br />
On this view indeed, one might laughingly remark that Yoga at its best
is a smoke-screen thrown out by a battleship in self-protection.<br />
It may seem to you strange as you read this letter to have watched how
the pendulum has swung always a little more and more towards the side of
Magick. I do not know why this should have been, but that it is so I
have no doubt whatever. I see quite clearly now that Yoga from its very
first beginnings is liable to lead the mind away into a condition of
muddle, and though for each such state Yoga itself provides the
necessary cure, may not one ask oneself if it is really wise to begin
one’s work with axioms and postulates which are inherently dangerous.
The whole controversy might be expressed as a differential equation.
Their curves become identical only at infinity, and there is no doubt,
at least to my mind, that the curve of Magick follows a more pleasant
track than that of Yoga.<br />
To take one point alone: it is evidently more satisfactory to have one’s
malignant demons external to oneself.<br />
As I have written it has become clearer to me that this is the case, but
I should not like you to arise from its perusal with any idea that I
have been in some way derogating Yoga I would not like to maintain that
it is necessary to Magick because there have been many very great
magicians who knew nothing at all of the subject but I am just as
strongly convinced as I was before that the practice of Yoga in itself
is of enormous assistance to the Magician in his more intelligible path,
only adding that he should beware lest the logical antinomies inherent
in Yoga divert him from or discourage him in his simple path.</p>

>How do I use this template?<
That's a good question indeed, young apprentice! Let me answer it for you:
  - to transform markdown into html, use the following formula
pandoc --standalone --template template.html index.md -o index.html
