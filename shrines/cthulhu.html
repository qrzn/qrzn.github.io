<p>Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by writer H. P.
Lovecraft. It was first introduced in his short story “The Call of
Cthulhu”, published by the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928.
Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic
entities, this creature has since been featured in numerous popular
culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped
by cultists, in the shape of a green octopus, dragon, and a caricature
of human form. The Lovecraft-inspired universe, the Cthulhu Mythos,
where it exists with its fellow entities, is named after it.</p>
