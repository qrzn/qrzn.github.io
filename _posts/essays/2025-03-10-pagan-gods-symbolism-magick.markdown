## Ancient Planetary Gods in Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome

**Mesopotamian (Babylonian) Tradition:** The earliest known links between planets and gods come from Mesopotamia. The Babylonians identified the visible “wandering stars” with major deities of their pantheon. For example, Jupiter was linked to **Marduk**, Venus to **Ishtar**, Saturn to **Ninurta** (Ninib), Mercury to **Nabu**, and Mars to **Nergal** ([Babylonian astrology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astrology#:~:text=,Mars%20%20with%20%2092)). The Sun was associated with the sun-god **Shamash** and the Moon with the moon-god **Sin** ([Babylonian astrology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astrology#:~:text=,Mars%20%20with%20%2092)). These celestial bodies were not merely lights in the sky – they were seen as the living activity of the gods “preparing the occurrences on Earth” ([Babylonian astrology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astrology#:~:text=The%20movements%20of%20the%20Sun%2C,were%20aiming%20to%20bring%20about)). If a planet appeared ominous (e.g. a lunar eclipse or the dimming of Mars), it was interpreted as that god signaling unrest or fate; priests would then perform rituals to appease the deity and avert misfortune ([Babylonian astrology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astrology#:~:text=The%20gods%20were%20also%20believed,event%20must%20have%20some%20kind)) ([Babylonian astrology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astrology#:~:text=Ulla%20Koch,the%20most%20important%20distinction%20between)). This demonstrates that for Babylonians, astronomy, astrology, and religion were deeply intertwined – the movements of planets were quite literally divine actions.

**Egyptian Tradition:** In ancient Egypt, the five visible planets were likewise tied to gods, though Egyptian star lore often portrayed them as avatars of Horus or other deities. Egyptians called the planets the “stars that know no rest,” envisioning them as gods sailing across the sky in eternal motion ([Worship of heavenly bodies - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worship_of_heavenly_bodies#:~:text=11%20,Horus%20bull)). Mercury was known as **Sebegu** (seen as a form of Set), Venus was called “**the One Who Crosses**” (a morning star deity), Mars was “**Horus of the Horizon**” (or “Horus the Red”), Jupiter was “**Horus Who Limits the Two Lands**” (a god maintaining cosmic order), and Saturn was “**Horus Bull of the Heavens**” ([Worship of heavenly bodies - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worship_of_heavenly_bodies#:~:text=11%20,Horus%20bull)). Each planet’s behavior (e.g. Mars’ red color or Saturn’s slow cycle) was mythologized in terms of these deities’ attributes. While Egyptian religion was largely solar and stellar, these planetary gods played a role in calendars and omens. For instance, texts from the New Kingdom period name Jupiter as “Horus who Limits the Two Lands” and Venus as the “God of the Morning,” indicating their significance in royal and agricultural astrology ([who are Astronomical gods?](https://www.youregypttours.com/egypt-tours-blog/who-are-Astronomical-gods#:~:text=and%20the%20OSIREION%20of%20Seti,of%20the%20Soul%20of%20Horus)) ([who are Astronomical gods?](https://www.youregypttours.com/egypt-tours-blog/who-are-Astronomical-gods#:~:text=Jupiter%20was%20named%20Horus%20Who,big%20dipper%2C%20called%20Meskhet%2C%20and)).

**Greek Tradition:** The Greeks inherited and syncretized much of this celestial theology. In Greek mythology, the planets were explicitly identified with Olympian gods. The Greeks personified the Sun as **Helios** (later equated with Apollo as solar deity) and the Moon as **Selene** (sometimes Artemis) ([Oceanids • Facts and Information on the Goddess Oceanids](https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/goddesses/oceanids/#:~:text=In%20Ancient%20Greece%2C%20every%20element,winds%20were%20the%20four%20Anemoi)). The five other classical planets were called by divine names: Mercury was **Hermes**, Venus was **Aphrodite**, Mars was **Ares**, Jupiter was **Zeus**, and Saturn was **Cronus** ([history - Why the ancient Greeks associated planets with gods? - Astronomy Stack Exchange](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/55732/why-the-ancient-greeks-associated-planets-with-gods#:~:text=They%20associated%20the%20Sun%20with,did%20associate%20planets%20with%20gods)). In Hellenistic texts, each planet had a Greek name (often descriptive) and was linked to a deity – for example, Phaínōn (“the Shining One”) was Saturn’s name, identified with Cronus, and Phōsphoros (“the Light-Bringer”) was Venus, identified with Aphrodite ([history - Why the ancient Greeks associated planets with gods? - Astronomy Stack Exchange](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/55732/why-the-ancient-greeks-associated-planets-with-gods#:~:text=They%20associated%20the%20Sun%20with,did%20associate%20planets%20with%20gods)). To the Greeks, these gods on their heavenly courses were the governors of human fate and natural phenomena. As one classical source notes, _“Stilbon (Mercury) is Hermes, gleaming in the night; Pyroeis (Mars) is Ares, fiery and red; Phaethon (Jupiter) is Zeus; Phainon (Saturn) is Cronus”_ ([history - Why the ancient Greeks associated planets with gods? - Astronomy Stack Exchange](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/55732/why-the-ancient-greeks-associated-planets-with-gods#:~:text=They%20associated%20the%20Sun%20with,did%20associate%20planets%20with%20gods)). Greek poets and philosophers often spoke of the “dance of the stars” as the literal will of the gods – an idea that set the stage for astrological fate in the Hellenistic world.

**Roman Tradition:** The Romans, drawing on Etruscan and Greek influences, assigned their own gods to the planets and adopted these names for the planets themselves – a convention that endures in Western languages. The Roman god **Mercury** (patron of messengers and commerce) gave his name to the fleet planet Mercury; **Venus** (goddess of love and beauty) to the bright planet Venus; **Mars** (god of war) to the red planet Mars; **Jupiter** (king of the gods) to the largest planet; and **Saturn** (an agricultural and time god) to the farthest visible planet ([Who Named the Planets? ](https://www.history.com/news/who-named-the-planets#:~:text=Romans%20named%20the%20solar%20system%E2%80%99s,goddess%20of%20love%20and%20beauty)). The Sun and Moon were venerated as **Sol** (often identified with Apollo in later syncretism) and **Luna** (often identified with Diana), respectively. The Romans famously correlated the seven-day week with the seven planetary gods (dies Solis, dies Lunae, dies Martis, etc.), cementing the astrological heptarchy into daily life. Roman astrologers, much like the Greeks, believed these planetary gods influenced everything from personality to events. For example, a person born under Saturn would be dour or contemplative (reflecting Cronus/Saturn’s slow and serious nature), whereas someone under Jupiter’s hour might be optimistic and regal (echoing jovial Zeus) ([Who Named the Planets? ](https://www.history.com/news/who-named-the-planets#:~:text=Romans%20named%20the%20solar%20system%E2%80%99s,goddess%20of%20love%20and%20beauty)). In Roman practice, observing the planet-gods’ positions was a way to read the will of **Jupiter** or propitiate **Venus**, etc. – essentially blending state religion with astral fate.

_In all these ancient cultures, the planets were far more than celestial objects; they were visible gods. This historical overview shows a clear progression: Babylon gave the planets identities as patron gods, Egypt reinterpreted them within its own theological framework, and the Greco-Roman world standardized the names that remain familiar today. These attributions provided the foundation for later astrological and occult systems, which treated the planets as living symbols of divine archetypes._

## Astrology as Cosmic Theurgy: Planets as Divine Forces of Fate

Across the ancient Mediterranean and Near East, astrology developed as a form of **cosmic theurgy** – a way to work with or appease the gods of fate. The premise was that the planets are not merely indicators of fate but **agents** of it, each planet embodying a divine force that governs destinies. In Mesopotamia, for example, astral divination was essentially a dialog with the gods: _“Stars were considered to be representations of gods whose favors could be courted through prayers, magical incantations and amulets”_ ([Hellenistic Astrology &mdash; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/hellenistic-astrology/#:~:text=the%20Seleucid%20era%20,Given)). If Saturn (Ninurta) was malefic in the sky, one might perform a Saturnine rite to mitigate his harsh influence. This mindset – that by aligning with the planets one petitions the gods – is the essence of astrology as theurgy (Greek _theourgia_, “god-working”).

Under Hellenistic and Neoplatonic philosophy, this idea was further systematized. The Stoics spoke of _sympatheia_ (sympathy) binding the cosmos – a grand cosmic order where earthly events correspond to stellar motions. The planets were seen as **cosmic governors** or emissaries of the Logos (divine order), weaving the web of fate (Heimarmene) ([Hellenistic Astrology &mdash; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/hellenistic-astrology/#:~:text=The%20role%20of%20Fate%20was,was%20divine%20and%20sometimes%20dispensed)) ([Hellenistic Astrology &mdash; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/hellenistic-astrology/#:~:text=injustices%20of%20Fate,predictable%20science%20for%20the%20initiated)). To cast a horoscope was to glimpse the script of the gods for a person’s life. However, beyond passive divination, the more spiritually daring sought to **influence or transcend fate by ritually engaging with planetary deities**. The Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus asserted that through theurgy – sacred rites invoking cosmic gods – the soul could rise above the deterministic spheres of the planets and reunite with the One. He viewed astrology as a lower form of knowledge useful for understanding one’s daemon (guardian spirit), but it was theurgy that allowed one to actually _work_ with those celestial powers to achieve divine union ([Ep. 435 Transcript: Proclus and Astrology in Platonism - The Astrology Podcast](https://theastrologypodcast.com/transcripts/ep-435-transcript-proclus-and-astrology-in-platonism/#:~:text=JMR%3A%20Exactly,up%20by%20Iamblichus%20who%20was)) ([Ep. 435 Transcript: Proclus and Astrology in Platonism - The Astrology Podcast](https://theastrologypodcast.com/transcripts/ep-435-transcript-proclus-and-astrology-in-platonism/#:~:text=match%20at%20L359%20So%20there%E2%80%99s,it%20is%20beyond%20our%20reason%E2%80%99s)). In other words, rather than being helplessly bound by planetary fate, one could perform _ritual operations_ to align oneself with the higher aspect of the planets and thus ameliorate their influences.

This approach turned astrology into a **practical, spiritual art**. Philosophers like Proclus and magi of the later Greco-Egyptian milieu (reflected in texts like the _Chaldean Oracles_ and the _Greek Magical Papyri_) gave instructions for invoking planetary gods through hymns, perfumes, gemstones, and symbols corresponding to each planet. For example, to invoke Jupiter (Zeus) one might wear purple, burn cedar or saffron, and intone a hymn on a Thursday in the hour of Jupiter – thereby participating in cosmic theurgy by “aligning the signatures” of that planet ([THE PLANETARY HOURS: Epicycle 1, by Mustafa al-Laylah Bey &mdash; THESE NEW OLD TRADITIONS](https://newoldtraditions.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/the-planetary-hours-epicycle-1-by-mustafa-al-laylah-bey/#:~:text=particular%20planet,force%20and%20us%20poor%2C%20amnesiac)) ([THE PLANETARY HOURS: Epicycle 1, by Mustafa al-Laylah Bey &mdash; THESE NEW OLD TRADITIONS](https://newoldtraditions.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/the-planetary-hours-epicycle-1-by-mustafa-al-laylah-bey/#:~:text=the%20sequence%20given%20for%20the,Mercury%3B%20Yesod%20%3D%20Moon)). The underlying theory is that the cosmos is a grand hierarchy of being (a “Great Chain of Being”), with the planets as intermediaries between the material world and the higher divine. By performing the correct rites at the proper astrological times, the theurgist essentially **plugs into the cosmic circuit**, invoking the planetary spirit to descend into a ritual statue, talisman, or the magician’s own sphere. Iamblichus describes these as _symbola_ that attract the gods – the planet-gods see their likeness in the offering (color, sound, smell) and thus make their presence known ([Ep. 435 Transcript: Proclus and Astrology in Platonism - The Astrology Podcast](https://theastrologypodcast.com/transcripts/ep-435-transcript-proclus-and-astrology-in-platonism/#:~:text=match%20at%20L353%20characterizes%20the,reflections%20on%20the%20limits%20of)) ([Ep. 435 Transcript: Proclus and Astrology in Platonism - The Astrology Podcast](https://theastrologypodcast.com/transcripts/ep-435-transcript-proclus-and-astrology-in-platonism/#:~:text=So%20there%E2%80%99s%20complex%20philosophical%20arguments,it%20is%20beyond%20our%20reason%E2%80%99s)).

Throughout the Renaissance, this doctrine saw a revival in the works of Hermetic magicians like Marsilio Ficino and Cornelius Agrippa. Ficino, for instance, recommended singing Orphic hymns to planets while playing corresponding music to draw down their influence (singing to Venus on Friday to soothe melancholy, or to Saturn to deepen contemplation) ([[PDF] Marsilio Ficino's Music Theory](https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1062&context=ojur#:~:text=,from%20the%20planet%20or%20planets)) ([[PDF] Voss, Angela, 'The Music of the Spheres: Marsilio Ficino and ...](http://www.cultureandcosmos.org/pdfs/2-2/Voss_Music_Spheres.pdf#:~:text=hymns%2C%20Ficino%20composed%20or%20improvised,He)). Such practices were explicitly termed “astral magic” – effectively a continuation of cosmic theurgy. The planets were each considered a gateway of specific energies: Saturn for contemplation and limitation, Jupiter for expansion and grace, Mars for strength and conflict, Sun for illumination and vitality, Venus for love and creativity, Mercury for intellect and communication, and Moon for imagination and change. In performing planetary magic, the magician was **working with the gods** (as the very word _theurgy_ implies). As a modern occult commentator puts it, _“Whenever we work with astrology we are working with the Gods, living spiritual intelligences”_ ([Astrology and Theurgy – Student of Astrology](https://studentofastrology.com/2018/08/astrology-and-theurgy/#:~:text=Whenever%20we%20work%20with%20astrology,way%20back%20to%20divine%20union)). Astrology provided the timing and correspondence schema, while theurgy provided the ritual method; together, they allowed a practitioner not just to _read_ fate but to _participate_ in it. This principle of cosmic theurgy – seeing the stars as living, responsive forces – is a cornerstone of esoteric philosophy and directly informs Hermetic Qabalah and Thelemic magick, as we shall see.

## Planetary Correspondences in Hermetic Qabalah (The Tree of Life)

Hermetic Qabalah, the occult tradition developed by Renaissance magi and later elaborated by organizations like the Golden Dawn, adopted the ancient planetary gods into a complex symbolic schema. Central to Hermetic Qabalah is the **Tree of Life** – a diagram of ten spheres (_sephiroth_) connected by 22 paths, mapping the emanations of divine reality. Each sephira on this Tree is associated with many correspondences, including divine names, angelic orders, colors, and critically, **planetary bodies**. The classical planets (plus the luminaries and earth) are assigned to the sephiroth in descending order, reflecting the Neoplatonic cosmology of concentric heavens. Thus, the third sephira **Binah** (“Understanding”) is linked to _Saturn_, Chesed to _Jupiter_, Geburah to _Mars_, Tiphareth to the _Sun_, Netzach to _Venus_, Hod to _Mercury_, Yesod to the _Moon_, and the tenth sephira Malkuth (“Kingdom”) corresponds to the _elemental Earth_ ([Q&A With Joy: Two Different Decan Rulers - Joy Vernon Astrology _ Tarot _ Reiki](https://joyvernon.com/qa-with-joy-two-different-decan-rulers/#:~:text=The%20first%20is%20based%20on,Life%2C%20from%20Binah%2FSaturn%20through%20Yesod%2FMoon)) ([THE PLANETARY HOURS: Epicycle 1, by Mustafa al-Laylah Bey &mdash; THESE NEW OLD TRADITIONS](https://newoldtraditions.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/the-planetary-hours-epicycle-1-by-mustafa-al-laylah-bey/#:~:text=the%20sequence%20given%20for%20the,Mercury%3B%20Yesod%20%3D%20Moon)). (The top two sephiroth, Kether and Chokmah, transcend the classical planets – Kether representing the Primum Mobile or the divine source, and Chokmah often associated with the fixed stars or zodiac as a whole.)

In this way, the Tree of Life serves as a **map of the cosmos** with the planetary gods integrated into the structure of creation. For example, Binah/Saturn is understood as the principle of structure, limitation, and understanding – much as Saturn in astrology represents discipline, time, and form. Chesed/Jupiter embodies expansion, benevolence, and authority (paralleling the astrological Jupiter’s role as “greater benefic”). Geburah/Mars signifies strength, severity, and courage (Mars’ combative force), whereas Tiphareth/Sun stands for harmony, beauty, and the solar Christ/Buddha consciousness at the center of the soul ([The Ethical Triad](https://qbl.thelemistas.org/printer/en/Ethical#:~:text=This%20is%20also%20the%20,this%20Triad%2C%20we%20are%20told)). Netzach/Venus on the Tree represents victory, love, and creative force; Hod/Mercury represents splendor, intellect, and communication; Yesod/Moon is foundation, imagination, the subconscious; and Malkuth/Earth is the material world, the domain of the four elements. Golden Dawn occultists explicitly taught this arrangement: _“Binah = Saturn; Chesed = Jupiter; Geburah = Mars; Tiphareth = Sun; Netzach = Venus; Hod = Mercury; Yesod = Moon”_ ([THE PLANETARY HOURS: Epicycle 1, by Mustafa al-Laylah Bey &mdash; THESE NEW OLD TRADITIONS](https://newoldtraditions.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/the-planetary-hours-epicycle-1-by-mustafa-al-laylah-bey/#:~:text=the%20sequence%20given%20for%20the,Mercury%3B%20Yesod%20%3D%20Moon)). By meditating on the Tree, the magician internalizes the cosmology of planetary forces arrayed in a hierarchical order from the divine to the material.

([image]()) _Diagram: The Hermetic Tree of Life with planetary attributions. Each sephira (numbered 1 through 10) is assigned a classical planet or element, as indicated by the symbol in each sphere – e.g. Binah (3) bears Saturn (♄), Chesed (4) Jupiter (♃), Geburah (5) Mars (♂), Tiphareth (6) the Sun (☉), Netzach (7) Venus (♀), Hod (8) Mercury (☿), Yesod (9) the Moon (☾), and Malkuth (10) the elements/Earth. Such diagrams are used by Hermeticists to visualize how cosmic forces (the planetary archetypes) emanate down the Tree into manifestation._

The practical significance of these correspondences in ritual work cannot be overstated. In the Hermetic worldview, **each sephira can be accessed or invoked through its planetary qualities**. Rituals often involve ascending the Tree in vision or calling down power from a specific sephira/planet. For instance, a magician seeking martial strength and energy might invoke **Geburah** by calling on the name of the Archangel of Mars (Khamael) on a Tuesday (Mars-day) in the hour of Mars, using red colors, the incense of iron or tobacco, and the divine name associated with Geburah. All of these are coordinated through Qabalistic correspondences to Mars/Geburah ([The Ethical Triad](https://qbl.thelemistas.org/printer/en/Ethical#:~:text=This%20is%20also%20the%20,this%20Triad%2C%20we%20are%20told)) ([The Ethical Triad](https://qbl.thelemistas.org/printer/en/Ethical#:~:text=You%20can%20think%20of%20this,intellect)). Similarly, to invoke the graceful influence of Jupiter, one focuses on Chesed: wearing blue or violet, burning incense of cedar or saffron, intoning the god-name _El_ or _Jehovah Tzadkiel_ (attributed to Chesed), and perhaps holding a talisman engraved with the symbol of Jupiter. What this achieves, in theory, is a tuning of the magician’s sphere of sensation to the **Sephira of Jupiter**, thus drawing down the benefic power of that planet-god.

The Tree of Life also provides a framework for **spiritual ascent**. The aspirant in the Hermetic tradition aims to raise consciousness through the planetary spheres back toward the Divine source (Kether). This journey is conceptualized as moving upward from Malkuth (earthly consciousness) to Yesod (the lunar astral world of images), then to Hod and Netzach (intellect and emotion, Mercury and Venus), to Tiphareth (solar soul/spirit, where one may encounter one’s Holy Guardian Angel), and further up to the supernal levels beyond Saturn. In Qabalistic terms, one might say the soul must confront and integrate the lessons of each planetary archetype on the way. Indeed, the Golden Dawn’s grade system assigned initiates degrees corresponding to the sephiroth: an initiate would advance through grades named after Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzach, etc., each grade involving tests and studies related to that sphere’s qualities (e.g. the Yesod grade involved mastering the astral and lunar magic, the Hod grade involved Mercurial knowledge and logick, and so on). Aleister Crowley’s mystical order A∴A∴ continued this scheme – for example, the grade of _Adeptus Minor_ was linked to Tiphareth (Sun), _Magister Templi_ to Binah (Saturn), etc., implying that the initiate has equilibrated the forces of those planetary spheres within themselves.

In summary, Hermetic Qabalah takes the old notion of planetary gods and **weaves it into a grand metaphysical diagram**. The Tree of Life becomes a “Rosetta Stone” of correspondences: one can translate between a planet, a god, an archangel, a tarot card, a metal, a color, a musical note, a chakra, and so on – because all are seen as vibratively linked. This synthesis allowed 19th and 20th-century occultists (such as those in the Golden Dawn and Thelema) to plan very elaborate rituals that hit all the right symbolic notes. For example, a consecration of a talisman of Venus would involve invoking Venus on multiple levels (Assiah, Yetzirah, Briah, Atziluth in Qabalistic terms): calling the divine name **YHVH Tzabaoth** for Netzach, the archangel **Haniel**, the angel order **Elohim**, the planet Venus, the metal copper, the color green, the number 7, perhaps the Sephirotic title **Victory**, and the mythic personas of Venus/Aphrodite. By doing so, the magician believes they are **saturating their working with the Venus force** in its purest form, as emanated from the Netzach sephira on the Tree ([Astrology and Kabalah – Kabbalistic Feminist Astrology](https://kabalicastrology.com/astrology-and-kabalah/#:~:text=Tipharet%20)) ([Astrology and Kabalah – Kabbalistic Feminist Astrology](https://kabalicastrology.com/astrology-and-kabalah/#:~:text=Binah%20)).

The Qabalistic planetary correspondences thus bridge **mystical philosophy and practical occult application**. Philosophically, they assert that the powers of the pagan gods live on as facets of a monotheistic emanationist schema (each planet is a facet of the One Divine light refracted). Practically, they provide a template to engage with those powers in an organized way. This system was foundational for the magickal work of Aleister Crowley and his contemporaries, who often referred to the tables of **777** (Crowley’s compendium of correspondences) to design rituals aligning with specific planetary energies.

## Thelema and Modern Occult Movements: Crowley’s Planetary Magick in Practice

In the 20th century, Aleister Crowley – the founder of **Thelema** – carried the torch of planetary magick into modern occultism. Crowley was trained in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, so he inherited the rich correspondence system of Qabalah and astrology described above. Through his own mystical experiences and creativity, he wove the planets deeply into Thelemic theory and ritual. Thelema proclaims _“Every man and every woman is a star.”_ This famous line from Crowley’s _Book of the Law_ encapsulates the idea that each individual is a unique divine spark moving in their own orbit, akin to a star or planet ([Kenneth Anger: Every Man and Woman is a Star:](http://kennethanger.blogspot.com/2008/06/every-man-and-woman-is-star.html#:~:text=The%20essence%20of%20Thelema%20is,http%3A%2F%2F209.85.173.104%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dcache%3A8ScxLMYBrd4J%3Awww.avalonia.co.uk%2Fmagick%2Fthel)). Philosophically, it positions the human being as a microcosm of the macrocosm – we contain the planetary forces within us, and by knowing our own “orbit” (True Will) we harmonize with the cosmos. Thus, Thelemites view the planetary archetypes as expressions of human potential and divine facets. Nuit, the goddess of infinite space in Thelemic cosmology, is essentially the starry heavens, and we (as stars) are children of Nuit – implying that understanding the stars (planets) is key to understanding ourselves ([Kenneth Anger: Every Man and Woman is a Star:](http://kennethanger.blogspot.com/2008/06/every-man-and-woman-is-star.html#:~:text=The%20essence%20of%20Thelema%20is,http%3A%2F%2F209.85.173.104%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dcache%3A8ScxLMYBrd4J%3Awww.avalonia.co.uk%2Fmagick%2Fthel)).

Crowley’s practical planetary magick builds on this philosophy. One of his notable contributions was the series of rituals known as the **Rites of Eleusis** in 1910 – seven public rituals, each dedicated to one of the classical planets ([Rites of Eleusis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rites_of_Eleusis#:~:text=The%20Rites%20of%20Eleusis%20were,1)). These were dramatic invocations combining poetry, music, dance, and liturgy to invoke the essence of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna in turn. For example, _The Rite of Saturn_ had participants dress in black or dark blue, symbolizing Saturn’s qualities, and involved austere, heavy imagery and invocations of chronos time and death ([[PDF] The Rites of Eleusis - 100th Monkey Press](https://www.100thmonkeypress.com/biblio/acrowley/books/rites_of_eleusis_1910/eleusis_text.pdf#:~:text=ALEISTER%20CROWLEY%20in%20%E2%80%9CEleusis,violet%2C%20for%20Mars%20scarlet)). _The Rite of Jupiter_ used purple robes, invoking themes of rulership and providence; _The Rite of Mars_ was performed in scarlet with martial songs, and so on ([[PDF] The Rites of Eleusis - 100th Monkey Press](https://www.100thmonkeypress.com/biblio/acrowley/books/rites_of_eleusis_1910/eleusis_text.pdf#:~:text=ALEISTER%20CROWLEY%20in%20%E2%80%9CEleusis,violet%2C%20for%20Mars%20scarlet)). Crowley described these rites as a form of “high theatre” to invoke **religious ecstasy** in the audience, effectively letting them experience the vibration of each planetary force ([Rites of Eleusis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rites_of_Eleusis#:~:text=The%20names%20of%20the%20seven,a%20lover%20of%20%2045)). The Rites of Eleusis exemplify how Thelema treats the planetary gods not as outdated superstitions but as **living archetypes** to be experienced directly. By cycling through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, Luna, one undergoes a kind of alchemical transmutation of the soul, balancing all the forces.

Beyond public rituals, Crowley incorporated planetary magick into personal practice and teaching. In _Magick in Theory and Practice_ and other writings, he gave instructions for crafting talismans and pentacles engraved with planetary symbols and divine names to attract certain influences. He also adapted the Golden Dawn’s _Greater Ritual of the Hexagram_, which is explicitly used to invoke or banish planetary forces. In the Greater Hexagram ritual, one traces a hexagram oriented for a particular planet (each planet has a unique geometric configuration of the hexagram) and vibrates the Hebrew God-name or astrological name associated with that planet to either call its power in or send it away. Crowley taught his students to use such rituals when they needed to attune to a planet for specific magickal goals – for instance, invoking Jupiter for expansion and wealth in a financial undertaking, or banishing Saturn if depressive or obstructive energies were prevalent. His manuscript _Liber O_ outlines these practices, making it clear that the magician should have memorized the various symbols and names for each planet and practiced drawing down those energies.

Another daily Thelemic practice, _Liber Resh vel Helios_, while solar in focus, shows the importance of astro-theology: it consists of adorations to the Sun at dawn, noon, sunset, and midnight (addressing the Sun in its aspects as Ra, Ahathoor, Tum, and Khephra). Although not addressing all planets, it instills in the aspirant a rhythm of conscious alignment with celestial cycles (the solar day), reinforcing the concept of living in harmony with cosmic forces. For the other planets, practitioners often choose specific days and hours for workings – e.g. performing a love spell in the hour of Venus on a Friday, or starting a new intellectual project in the hour of Mercury on Wednesday. These choices reflect the longstanding astrological timing rules, which Crowley and Thelemites continue to value as part of effective magick.

Crowley’s published tables (_777_) and essays also give insight into how he viewed each planetary archetype. He correlated the planets with the sephiroth, the alchemical metals, the tarot trumps, classical deities, and even personal psychological states. For instance, in his Tarot (the _Book of Thoth_ deck), the seven planetary trumps – _The Magus_ (Mercury), _The High Priestess_ (Moon), _The Empress_ (Venus), _Fortune_ (Jupiter), _The Tower_ (Mars), _The Sun_ (Sun), _The Universe_ (Saturn) – are rich with symbolism that Crowley interprets in both mystical and practical terms. In Thelemic thought, these archetypes are tools for self-realization: by meditating on the _Fortune_ card (Jupiter) one learns about the ups and downs of fate and the attitude of expansive joy, by invoking _The Tower_ (Mars) one confronts the force of sudden change and the martial aspect of one’s own nature, etc.

It is also worth mentioning that Crowley associated the seven planetary energies with specific _grades of initiation_ in his A∴A∴ system (as touched on in the Qabalah section). The journey of the adept in Thelema involves mastering each planetary sphere: the idea is that one must equilibrate the elemental/earthly forces (Malkuth), gain control over the lunar astral plane (Yesod), balance intellect and emotion (Hod and Netzach – Mercury and Venus), reach the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel at Tiphareth (Sun – the central divine Self), then pass through the “Veil of Paroketh” toward the higher adepthoods associated with Mars and Jupiter, and finally cross the Abyss to attain the Saturnian understanding of a Master in Binah. Crowley’s imagery and instructions for these leaps are filled with planetary references. For example, crossing the Abyss is sometimes described as confronting _Choronzon_, the demon of dispersion, which occurs in the “sphere” of Da’ath (on the path between the planetary spheres and the supernals) – a trial of Saturnian isolation and surrender.

In Thelemic ritual today, magicians continue to perform planetary invocations much as Crowley did, often referencing his works. A Thelemite might perform a self-initiation invoking Mars energy to gain courage for a challenging life event, using Crowley’s invocation of Horus or Ares. They might perform a devotional ritual to Venus (such as _Liber Astarte_, which Crowley wrote on the practice of bhakti yoga towards a chosen deity – Astarte being an aspect of Venus) to enhance their capacity to love and create art. Thelemites also use the planetary **hexagram** signs in the ritual called the Star Sapphire (Crowley’s version of the Hexagram ritual) which encodes the union of opposites and the formulae of sex magick, implicitly calling upon the planetary powers to sanctify the “holy hexagram” (a symbol of the union of the microcosm and macrocosm).

Thus, modern occult movements have **expanded and reinterpreted planetary magic** in line with contemporary spiritual aims. The core notion remains that the planets are accessible, potent archetypal forces. Crowley’s irreverent yet profound engagement with them – treating ancient gods like intimate personal forces – opened the way for practitioners to incorporate planetary magick into everything from the casting of spells and the crafting of sigils to the performance of dramatic rituals and the pursuit of enlightenment. Under the law of Thelema (_“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law”_), the planets are like seven teachers helping each individual star find its true will in the cosmos.

## Philosophical Implications of Planetary Archetypes in Esoteric Traditions

The enduring presence of planetary gods in esoteric systems speaks to their power as **archetypes of human and cosmic experience**. Philosophically, each planet represents a fundamental principle or archetypal idea that recurs across mythology, psychology, and nature. Esoteric traditions hold that these principles are not merely external forces but also exist **within** the microcosm of man. This is the Hermetic maxim _“As above, so below”_ in action – the macrocosmic planets correspond to the microcosmic facets of the soul ([Kenneth Anger: Every Man and Woman is a Star:](http://kennethanger.blogspot.com/2008/06/every-man-and-woman-is-star.html#:~:text=The%20essence%20of%20Thelema%20is,http%3A%2F%2F209.85.173.104%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dcache%3A8ScxLMYBrd4J%3Awww.avalonia.co.uk%2Fmagick%2Fthel)). For example, Saturn as an archetype signifies structure, limitation, and wisdom through hardship – one can observe Saturn in the strict father figure in myth (Cronus), in the inevitability of time and death, and internally in one’s capacity for discipline and understanding born of suffering. Mars signifies the principle of energy, conflict, and courage – evident in war gods, in the biological adrenaline response, and in personal assertiveness and willpower. By studying and meditating on the planetary archetypes, esoteric practitioners seek to **understand themselves** and the universe in a deeper way, seeing the reflections between the gods and the psyche.

Jungian psychology even incorporated this idea by referring to planetary names for archetypes (though Jung himself was cautious, later practitioners like Liz Greene have explicitly correlated astrology and analytic psychology). The impulse to personify the impersonal cosmos as gods serves a philosophical function: it makes the universe **ensouled and meaningful**. Rather than random movements, the orbits of planets become deliberate dances of divine characters, each with a story and lesson. This invites a personal relationship with fate. A stoic might resign to “Saturn is heavy today,” whereas a magician will say “Saturn is teaching me patience today, I will honor him.” The archetypes thus provide a language to talk about fate, character, and ethics. In astrological philosophy, a well-balanced life is one that gives each planetary force its due: **Solar** radiance (individual selfhood and generosity), **Lunar** adaptability and intuition, **Mercurial** intellect and flexibility, **Venereal** love and harmony, **Martial** strength and courage, **Jovian** faith and leadership, and **Saturnine** depth and endurance. The Hermetic concept of the _medicina astra_ (astral medicine) even posited that imbalances or illnesses could be treated by invoking the appropriate planetary force to counteract excess or deficiency of another – a metaphysical homeostasis via archetypes.

There are also profound **metaphysical questions** tied to planetary symbolism. One is the issue of fate vs. free will. If the planets “govern” fate, what freedom has the soul? Esoteric traditions answered this by distinguishing the outer aspect of the planets (deterministic fate) from their inner aspect (spiritual lessons). The planets compel the unenlightened, but the initiate who masters the planetary forces within rises above mechanical fate. In the _Mithraic Liturgy_ and Gnostic myths, the soul descending from heaven puts on planetary qualities like garments, and in ascending again must take them off to return to the One – implying that the true self is beyond the planets, yet must consciously traverse them. Thelema’s perspective that each person is a star among stars suggests a universe of unique orbits where destiny is not a prison but an expression of one’s true will in harmony with the cosmic order ([Kenneth Anger: Every Man and Woman is a Star:](http://kennethanger.blogspot.com/2008/06/every-man-and-woman-is-star.html#:~:text=The%20essence%20of%20Thelema%20is,http%3A%2F%2F209.85.173.104%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dcache%3A8ScxLMYBrd4J%3Awww.avalonia.co.uk%2Fmagick%2Fthel)). _“Every man and every woman is a star”_ – a philosophical assertion that individual free will (true will) and cosmic law are ultimately aligned, not opposed. Each planetary deity, then, can be seen as an initiatory gate: by assimilating the virtues of that archetype, one gains more freedom. As Crowley writes in _The Heart of the Master_, _“Thou must pass through the seven satellites before thou canst enter the blessed realm”_, suggesting the soul must integrate Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, Moon to attain the next stage of consciousness.

Another implication is the **re-enchantment of the world**. In a secular age, planets are often seen as dead rocks or gas balls – interesting only scientifically. Esoteric philosophy challenges this by insisting on their symbolic and spiritual reality. To the occultist, _Mars is not merely iron oxide; it is the red force of Geburah, the Sword of Severity, the engine of growth through conflict_. This doesn’t deny the physical facts; rather, it layers meaning upon them. One lives in a cosmos where _everything is speaking_, full of gods in disguise. This mode of consciousness can foster a profound sense of connection and purpose. The planets provide a cosmic drama in which humans have roles – one’s birth chart is like a script of how the planetary actors configured at one’s birth, giving insight into one’s strengths and challenges, and ritual magic is like an improvisation to steer the plot. Thus, life is given a mythic dimension; events are not just random but part of a dialogue with Mars, Venus, Mercury, etc. Practitioners often report that by viewing, say, a tough Saturn period in their life as “Saturn teaching me a lesson,” they cope with and transmute the experience better – pain is contextualized as initiation, not meaningless suffering.

Finally, the planetary archetypes underscore the **unity in diversity** of the divine. In pagan antiquity, the gods were separate beings often at odds; in occult philosophy, they are facets of the One Thing. The Tree of Life shows this unity – all sephiroth emanate from the singular Ein Sof (the infinite). Crowley similarly taught that _“Godhead is a unity, but appears as multiplicity”_. The planetary gods, for all their differences, are all expressions of the universal mind. By working with each, the aspirant slowly comes to realize that they are interacting with various masks of their own higher self. When a magician invokes Jupiter and then Mars, and feels the distinct energies, they are learning to wield both mercy and severity – ultimately to become a more complete vessel of the Holy Guardian Angel (often associated with the Sun/Tiphareth in Thelema). In the end, the goal is to integrate the seven into the one – to reconcile opposites (the hexagram, symbol of the union of fire and water, male and female, is also a union of the planetary forces). In advanced Thelemic sex magick, the symbolism of the _septenary_ gets transcended by the _holy octagon_ or _elevenfold_ formula, but the foundation remains the balanced development of the planetary powers.

In conclusion, the connection between pagan gods and planets, when traced from ancient history through esoteric symbolism and ritual practice, reveals a continuous thread: an attempt to understand humanity’s place in the cosmos and to actively participate in the creative forces of nature. What began as worship and omen-reading evolved into a sophisticated spiritual science – part astronomy, part psychology, part magic. The planets as pagan gods have never really left us: they shine now as archetypes and energies in the living traditions of astrology, Qabalah, and Thelema. They invite us to look up at the night sky with the same awe as our ancestors did, but also to look **within**, to find those gods as aspects of our own divinity. In the temple of the modern mage, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Luna, and Sol still preside as honored guests. Through historical insight, mystical philosophy, and practical magick, we engage with them in a sacred dance – the eternal cosmic theurgy – aligning the soul with the stars so that **the will of the gods and the will of the magician become one**.
