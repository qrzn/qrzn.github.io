## Ingredients (Makes 4 servings)

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 Tbsp almond flour
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 cup almond milk (sugar-free)
- 5 Tbsp Italica extra virgin olive oil
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 1 lemon (for decorating)
- Large loaf pan: 8 1/2″ x 4 1/2″ x 2 1/2″

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. In the meantime, grease the baking dish with a thin layer of olive oil using a brush, and prepare the ingredients.
2. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, almond flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the almond milk, Italica extra virgin olive oil, and lemon juice. Gradually fold the contents of the first bowl (flour, sugar, and baking powder/soda) into the second bowl, mixing well to remove any lumps.
4. Pour the batter into the baking pan and spread it evenly.
5. Bake for 35-40 minutes at 350° F.

### Chef’s Tip

- Insert a toothpick into the cake to check if it's done. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready. Remove it from the oven and set aside to cool.
