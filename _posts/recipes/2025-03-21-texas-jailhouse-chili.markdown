**Yields:** Approximately 6 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 1 hour 30 minutes

### Ingredients:

- 1 kg beef, cut into cubes (e.g., from the shoulder or chuck)
- 2 large onions, roughly chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 red bell peppers, roughly chopped
- 2 green bell peppers, roughly chopped
- 2-3 fresh jalapeño peppers, finely chopped (remove seeds for less heat)
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes
- 1 can (400g) diced tomatoes
- 500 ml beef broth
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more to taste)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Vegetable oil, for browning
- Optional: 1 can (400g) kidney beans or pinto beans, rinsed and drained
- Optional garnishes: grated cheese, sour cream, chopped onions, tortilla chips

### Instructions:

1.  **Brown the beef:** Heat some vegetable oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the beef cubes generously with salt and pepper. Brown the beef in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pot. Remove the browned beef and set aside.
2.  **Sauté the vegetables:** Add the chopped onions to the pot and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3.  **Add peppers and tomato paste:** Stir in the chopped red and green bell peppers, as well as the chopped jalapeños. Cook for about 5 minutes until the peppers start to soften. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
4.  **Add tomatoes and spices:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5.  **Simmer the chili:** Return the browned beef to the pot. Pour in the beef broth, ensuring the beef is mostly covered. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for at least 1.5 hours, or until the beef is very tender. Stir occasionally.
6.  **Add beans (optional):** If using beans, add them to the chili during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking.
7.  **Adjust seasoning and serve:** Taste the chili and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper as needed.
8.  **Serve hot:** Ladle the Texas Jailhouse Chili into bowls and serve hot with your favorite garnishes, such as grated cheese, sour cream, chopped onions, and tortilla chips.

**Notes:**

- For a milder chili, remove the seeds and membranes from the jalapeño peppers.
- You can adjust the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper to your preferred level of spiciness.
- For a richer flavor, you can use a combination of different types of dried chilies instead of just chili powder. Toast them lightly before grinding and adding to the chili.
- This chili tastes even better the next day after the flavors have had a chance to meld.
- You can also make this chili in a slow cooker. Brown the beef and sauté the vegetables on the stovetop first, then transfer everything to the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours.
