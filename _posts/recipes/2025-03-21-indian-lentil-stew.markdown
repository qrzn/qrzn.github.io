**Yields:** Approximately 4 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 35 minutes

### Ingredients:

- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 piece of ginger (approx. 2 cm), chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 2 spring onions, cut into rings
- 2 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp mustard seeds
- 200 g red lentils
- 400 ml vegetable broth
- 1 can (400g) chopped tomatoes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh coriander, chopped (for garnish)

### Instructions:

1.  **Prepare the vegetables:** Chop the garlic and ginger. Cut the spring onions into rings and the bell peppers into dice.
2.  **Roast spices and sauté aromatics:** Heat the oil in a pot. Roast the curry powder and mustard seeds in the hot oil for a short time until the mustard seeds start to pop. Add the chopped garlic and ginger and sauté briefly.
3.  **Add lentils and peppers:** Add the red lentils and diced bell peppers to the pot and sauté briefly as well.
4.  **Add remaining ingredients:** Pour in the vegetable broth and add the chopped tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  **Simmer the stew:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are soft and the stew has thickened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6.  **Stir in spring onions:** Stir in the spring onion rings during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
7.  **Season and serve:** Taste the lentil stew and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.
8.  **Garnish and serve:** Ladle the Indian lentil stew into bowls and garnish with fresh chopped coriander before serving. Serve hot with rice, naan bread, or yogurt, if desired.

**Tips:**

- For a spicier stew, you can add a pinch of chili flakes or a chopped fresh chili pepper along with the garlic and ginger.
- You can also add other vegetables to the stew, such as carrots, potatoes, or spinach. Add harder vegetables earlier in the cooking process.
- If you prefer a smoother consistency, you can partially blend the stew with an immersion blender after it has finished cooking.
- This lentil stew is a great vegetarian or vegan meal. Ensure you are using a vegetable broth to keep it vegan.
- Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for several days and reheated easily. The flavors often develop even more overnight.
