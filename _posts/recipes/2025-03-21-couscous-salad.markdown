**Yields:** Approximately 4 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes

### Ingredients:

- 200 g couscous
- 200 ml vegetable broth (or water with vegetable bouillon)
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, diced
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 2 tomatoes, diced
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped
- 100 g feta cheese, crumbled
- A handful of fresh parsley, chopped
- A handful of fresh mint, chopped

**For the dressing:**

- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more to taste)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1.  **Prepare the couscous:** Place the couscous in a bowl. Bring the vegetable broth to a boil and pour it over the couscous. Cover the bowl and let the couscous soak for about 10 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff the couscous with a fork.
2.  **Prepare the vegetables:** While the couscous is soaking, wash and dice the bell peppers, cucumber, and tomatoes. Finely chop the red onion.
3.  **Make the dressing:** In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
4.  **Assemble the salad:** In a large bowl, combine the fluffed couscous, diced bell peppers, cucumber, tomatoes, and chopped red onion.
5.  **Add feta and herbs:** Sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese, chopped parsley, and chopped mint over the salad.
6.  **Dress the salad:** Pour the dressing over the salad and mix everything gently but thoroughly.
7.  **Chill (optional):** For the best flavor, cover the salad and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together.
8.  **Serve:** Serve the couscous salad as a side dish or a light main course.

**Tips:**

- You can add other vegetables to the salad, such as corn, zucchini, or olives.
- For a milder flavor, you can reduce or omit the cayenne pepper.
- If you don't have fresh mint, you can use more parsley or other fresh herbs like cilantro.
- This salad is a great make-ahead dish and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. The flavors will actually intensify over time.
