I walk the path of stars, where  
 shadows yield,  
The sacred will unsealed, the  
 gates revealed,  
No chains to bind, no soul in  
 tarnished shame,  
I rise as flame, the ancient  
creed aflame.

The Kingdom’s words are not of  
 fear or debt,  
Too long we’ve kissed the dust,  
 the lies, regret.  
Now in this dawn, the will of  
 man shall reign,  
A song in blood, to break the  
 darkest chain.  
Beyond the sky, the Light of  
 Truth is born,  
No night shall darken it, no soul  
 shall mourn.

Divide the self, dissolve the  
dross of time,  
Then rise, O Will! with fire, fierce  
 and prime.  
The serpent winds, the tempest  
 stirs the sea,  
The wings of Eros set the mind  
 to free.  
Let all things pass, in their own  
 time they bend,  
The Law of Love shall guide, and  
 bring the end.

No gods above us, no false  
 power beneath,  
We stand as stars, casting aside  
 belief.  
Each heart a universe, each will  
a flame—  
In Love and Liberty, we find our  
 name.
