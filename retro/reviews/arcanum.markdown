# Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura

Released in 2000 by Troika Games, _Arcanum_ blends **steampunk** and **fantasy** elements into a sprawling, open-ended RPG. It offers a deep character system, rich world-building, and a storyline that lets you decide the fate of a realm teetering between technology and magic.

## Overview

Awakening as the sole survivor of a zeppelin crash, you find yourself with a mysterious prophecy thrust upon you. From humble beginnings, you’ll explore a vast world—brimming with dwarven inventions, elven mysteries, orcish labor unrest, and cunning industrialists. _Arcanum_ stands out for allowing players to customize their hero as a brilliant technologist, a gifted mage, or somewhere in between.

**Key Highlights:**

- An isometric RPG with sandbox elements: Emphasis on non-linear quests and branching dialogue.
- Steampunk meets High Fantasy: Firearms, locomotive trains, and intricate clockwork gadgets coexist with magical spells and mythical creatures.
- Complex skill & alignment system: The storyline, factions, and NPCs react dynamically to your choices and reputations.

## Graphics & Sound

_Arcanum’s_ 2D/3D hybrid engine shows its age but retains a unique charm. The old-world aesthetic of Victorian streets and archaic labs complements the fantasy vibes.

**Audio**:

- A haunting string-based soundtrack that shifts between melancholic and whimsical.
- Memorable voice acting for key NPCs, though not fully voiced.

## Gameplay & RPG Mechanics

### Character Development

Choose from multiple races (human, elf, dwarf, half-ogre, etc.) and a wide array of background perks that shape your origin story. Attributes, skills, tech degrees, and spell colleges create nearly endless build possibilities.

### Magic vs. Technology

The game’s core tension: technology disrupts magical fields, while magic can jam mechanical devices. Your chosen path influences quest solutions, equipment use, and faction relationships.

### Exploration & Choice

Open-world travel with numerous towns, dungeons, and hidden side quests. Your moral and ethical decisions drastically change how characters perceive you, unlocking or blocking certain storylines.

## Performance & Patches

Being an older title, _Arcanum_ greatly benefits from community patches:

- **Unofficial Arcanum Patch**: Fixes bugs, rebalances gameplay, adds races, and improves resolution support.
- **Arcanum Factory**: Tools for modding vendor inventories and other behind-the-scenes tweaks.

These fixes ensure stability and modern compatibility, plus bigger resolutions and improved font readability.

## Verdict

_Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura_ remains a cult classic for CRPG enthusiasts who crave deep role-playing systems and a richly imaginative setting. Despite an occasionally clunky interface, it’s an experience that can captivate you for dozens of hours—especially when enhanced by fan-made patches.
