# Zeus & Poseidon

_Zeus & Poseidon_ is a legendary addition to Sierra’s city-building franchise, set in the mythological tapestry of ancient Greece. Building on the _Zeus_ base game, the _Poseidon_ expansion adds the realm of Atlantis and new adventures that push your architectural and managerial skills even further.

## Overview

As the ruler of a Greek city-state, you’ll oversee construction, resource management, festival planning, and interactions with gods and heroes. Mythical beasts roam the land, requiring hero-led missions to quell their havoc. The _Poseidon_ expansion delves deeper into high-level tech, Atlantean wonders, and advanced building mechanics.

**Key Highlights:**

- Mythological narratives: Summon gods like Zeus or Athena to protect your city and bless your people.
- Colonization & Conquest: Send out expeditions to found new colonies, gather exotic goods, and expand your influence.
- Rich storyline missions: From appeasing the gods to defeating mythical creatures, each mission feels like an epic tale.

## Graphics & Sound

The game’s 2D isometric graphics remain vibrant. Temples, theaters, and monuments bristle with color and activity. Character sprites and city animations may appear dated, but they hold a nostalgic charm, especially in HD or widescreen patches.

**Audio**:

- Lively Greek-inspired soundtrack that shifts with in-game events.
- Memorable voice lines from heroes, advisors, and city announcers.

## Gameplay & City-Building Features

### Resource & Industry Chains

Olives, wine, marble, sculptures, and more. Managing your labor force and trade routes is crucial to keeping your city (and gods) happy.

### Mythical Encounters

Monsters like Medusa and the Minotaur occasionally threaten your city. Summoning heroes—by building special housing and fulfilling requirements—adds a fun puzzle layer to city management.

### Diplomacy & Warfare

Greeks love alliances and rivalries. Expect to trade with friendly neighbors or fend off Spartan or Persian invasions. Balancing your military might with economy is essential to mission success.

## Performance & Patches

Modern resolutions can be achieved with the **HD Resolution & Widescreen Fix**:

- Eliminates black borders and supports 16:9, 16:10, and higher.
- Various bug fixes for compatibility with Windows 10/11.

## Verdict

A hallmark in classical-themed city-builders, _Zeus & Poseidon_ blends myth, architecture, and story-driven missions into a vibrant package. The HD patch ensures new players can enjoy it on modern systems, while returning fans can rediscover its mythic grandeur without squinting at tiny UI elements.
