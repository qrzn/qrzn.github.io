# Pharaoh & Cleopatra

_Pharaoh & Cleopatra_ transports you to the banks of the Nile, where constructing grand pyramids and monuments is just one facet of ruling ancient Egypt. Released in 1998 (with the _Cleopatra_ expansion soon after), this entry refined the classic city-building formula while adding a flavorful dose of Egyptian culture.

## Overview

Spanning multiple dynasties, you’ll oversee the rise of your city from a humble settlement to a thriving metropolis. You must manage flood cycles, crops, temples, and even ward off the occasional tomb robbers or invading tribes.

**Key Highlights:**

- Monumental construction: Build pyramids, temples, and the Sphinx to honor the gods and cement your legacy.
- Annual Nile flooding mechanic: Time your farming to coincide with inundation cycles for maximum harvest.
- Expansion content (Cleopatra): Adds more missions, a new storyline, and an emphasis on royal intrigue and advanced monuments.

## Graphics & Sound

Though 2D, the game’s art style is detailed and immersive. Desert landscapes, bustling bazaars, and well-animated workers bring life to your Egyptian city. The accompanying soundtrack features evocative Middle Eastern-inspired tunes.

**Audio**:

- Ambient market sounds and chatter spice up the city vibe.
- Distinct sound cues for everything from dispatching workers to worship services.

## Gameplay & City-Building Features

### Flood Cycles & Irrigation

A unique feature among Impressions city-builders, the Nile flood can make or break your agricultural production. Erect floodplain farms and plan accordingly.

### Deities & Worship

Gods like Ra, Osiris, and Bast have different domain influences. Neglect a deity and face plagues or crop failures; appease them with temples, festivals, and offerings for city-wide benefits.

### Military & Diplomacy

While predominantly a peaceful builder, the campaign features occasional invasions and rebellious uprisings. Maintaining fortifications and training archers or chariots can be vital.

## Performance & Patches

High-resolution or widescreen support can be achieved with various fan-made fixes:

- **HD Resolution & Widescreen Fix**: Eliminates scaling issues, enabling crisp visuals for modern displays.

## Verdict

With its strong thematic presentation, _Pharaoh & Cleopatra_ stands as a favorite in the city-building genre. The strategic interplay of Nile floods, worship systems, and grand monument projects keeps each mission fresh. High-res patches ensure you can enjoy the ancient ambiance without artifacting or cramped interfaces on today’s screens.
