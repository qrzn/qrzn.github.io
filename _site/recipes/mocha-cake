**Ingredients**

_For the Sponge Cake:_

- 4 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons hot water
- 150 g sugar
- 1 packet vanilla sugar
- 100 g flour
- 100 g cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

_For the Filling:_

- 800 ml heavy cream
- 110 g mocha or dark chocolate
- 2 tablespoons instant coffee powder
- 4 packets cream stabilizer (Sahnesteif)
- 4 packets vanilla sugar
- Chocolate decorations (e.g., mocha beans)

**Preparation**

1. **Prepare the Cream (Day Before):**

   - Pour the heavy cream into a saucepan and heat slowly while stirring until it reaches a boil.
   - Break the chocolate into pieces and melt it in the hot cream.
   - Stir in the instant coffee powder until fully dissolved.
   - Let the mixture cool, then refrigerate overnight.

2. **Bake the Sponge Cake (Day Before):**

   - Preheat the oven to 175°C (347°F) top and bottom heat.
   - Beat the eggs with hot water, sugar, and vanilla sugar until the mixture is pale and fluffy.
   - Gradually fold in the flour mixed with cornstarch and baking powder.
   - Line the bottom of a 28 cm (11-inch) springform pan with parchment paper.
   - Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 25-30 minutes.
   - Allow the cake to cool in the pan overnight.

3. **Assemble the Cake:**
   - Remove the sponge cake from the pan by running a dull knife around the edge, then invert the cake and remove the parchment paper.
   - Slice the cake horizontally into three equal layers.
   - Whip the chilled chocolate cream with cream stabilizer and vanilla sugar until stiff.
   - Use 3/4 of the cream to fill and coat the cake layers.
   - Place the remaining cream into a piping bag and pipe decorative swirls on top of the cake.
   - Decorate with chocolate motifs, such as mocha beans.
   - Chill the cake for about 2 hours before serving.

**Tips:**

- For added flavor, you can spread a thin layer of cherry jam on the bottom layer of the sponge cake.
- To enhance the coffee taste, consider increasing the amount of instant coffee powder in the cream.
- The cake can be frozen; however, add the chocolate decorations after thawing.

Enjoy your homemade Mocha Cake with Cooked Cream!
