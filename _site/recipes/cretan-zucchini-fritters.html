<p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Normal</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<p><strong>For the fritters:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>200 g potatoes</li>
  <li>100 g green zucchini</li>
  <li>50 g carrots</li>
  <li>80 g brown onions</li>
  <li>40 g halloumi, diced</li>
  <li>30 g feta cheese, crumbled</li>
  <li>3 eggs (size M)</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons wheat flour (Type 1050)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (for frying the onions)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For seasoning:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Cretan herb mix (Gemista)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons fresh or frozen celery leaves</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For the brine:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>500 g water</li>
  <li>20 g salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon crystalline citric acid</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additionally:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (for frying the fritters)</li>
  <li>Edible flowers and leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Wash the vegetables. Mix the water with salt and citric acid to create a brine. Peel the potatoes, carrots, and onions. Trim one end of the zucchini. Finely grate the zucchini, potatoes, and carrots into the brine and let them sit for 10 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a clean kitchen towel, thoroughly squeeze out the soaked vegetables. Discard the salty vegetable water. Place the pressed vegetables into a bowl and loosen them up. Sprinkle the flour and spices over the mixture and combine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dice the onions finely and sauté them in 2 tablespoons of olive oil until translucent and light brown. Add the sautéed onions to the vegetable mixture in the bowl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beat the eggs and add them along with the cheeses to the vegetable mixture. Mix everything into a homogeneous batter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan until fragrant. Drop spoonfuls of the batter into the pan and flatten them into patties. Fry the fritters on both sides until golden brown, then drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat until all the batter is used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrange the finished fritters on a serving platter, garnish as desired, and serve warm.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This recipe yields approximately 14 palm-sized fritters.</p>
