      <li>Gradually fold in the flour mixed with cornstarch and baking powder.</li>
      <li>Line the bottom of a 28 cm (11-inch) springform pan with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>

      <li>Use 3/4 of the cream to fill and coat the cake layers.</li>
