</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Cream (Day Before):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Pour the heavy cream into a saucepan and heat slowly while stirring until it reaches a boil.</li>
      <li>Break the chocolate into pieces and melt it in the hot cream.</li>
      <li>Stir in the instant coffee powder until fully dissolved.</li>
      <li>Let the mixture cool, then refrigerate overnight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bake the Sponge Cake (Day Before):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 175°C (347°F) top and bottom heat.</li>
      <li>Beat the eggs with hot water, sugar, and vanilla sugar until the mixture is pale and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Gradually fold in the flour mixed with cornstarch and baking powder.</li>
      <li>Line the bottom of a 28 cm (11-inch) springform pan with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan overnight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Assemble the Cake:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the sponge cake from the pan by running a dull knife around the edge, then invert the cake and remove the parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Slice the cake horizontally into three equal layers.</li>
      <li>Whip the chilled chocolate cream with cream stabilizer and vanilla sugar until stiff.</li>
      <li>Use 3/4 of the cream to fill and coat the cake layers.</li>
      <li>Place the remaining cream into a piping bag and pipe decorative swirls on top of the cake.</li>
      <li>Decorate with chocolate motifs, such as mocha beans.</li>
      <li>Chill the cake for about 2 hours before serving.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>For added flavor, you can spread a thin layer of cherry jam on the bottom layer of the sponge cake.</li>
  <li>To enhance the coffee taste, consider increasing the amount of instant coffee powder in the cream.</li>
  <li>The cake can be frozen; however, add the chocolate decorations after thawing.</li>
</ul>
