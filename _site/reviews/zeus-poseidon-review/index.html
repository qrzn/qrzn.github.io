<p><em>Zeus &amp; Poseidon</em> is a legendary addition to Sierra’s city-building franchise, set in the mythological tapestry of ancient Greece. Building on the <em>Zeus</em> base game, the <em>Poseidon</em> expansion adds the realm of Atlantis and new adventures that push your architectural and managerial skills even further.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>As the ruler of a Greek city-state, you’ll oversee construction, resource management, festival planning, and interactions with gods and heroes. Mythical beasts roam the land, requiring hero-led missions to quell their havoc. The <em>Poseidon</em> expansion delves deeper into high-level tech, Atlantean wonders, and advanced building mechanics.</p>

<p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mythological narratives: Summon gods like Zeus or Athena to protect your city and bless your people.</li>
  <li>Colonization &amp; Conquest: Send out expeditions to found new colonies, gather exotic goods, and expand your influence.</li>
  <li>Rich storyline missions: From appeasing the gods to defeating mythical creatures, each mission feels like an epic tale.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="graphics--sound">Graphics &amp; Sound</h2>

<p>The game’s 2D isometric graphics remain vibrant. Temples, theaters, and monuments bristle with color and activity. Character sprites and city animations may appear dated, but they hold a nostalgic charm, especially in HD or widescreen patches.</p>

<p><strong>Audio</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lively Greek-inspired soundtrack that shifts with in-game events.</li>
  <li>Memorable voice lines from heroes, advisors, and city announcers.</li>
</ul>
