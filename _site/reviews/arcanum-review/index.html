<p>Released in 2000 by Troika Games, <em>Arcanum</em> blends <strong>steampunk</strong> and <strong>fantasy</strong> elements into a sprawling, open-ended RPG. It offers a deep character system, rich world-building, and a storyline that lets you decide the fate of a realm teetering between technology and magic.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Awakening as the sole survivor of a zeppelin crash, you find yourself with a mysterious prophecy thrust upon you. From humble beginnings, you’ll explore a vast world—brimming with dwarven inventions, elven mysteries, orcish labor unrest, and cunning industrialists. <em>Arcanum</em> stands out for allowing players to customize their hero as a brilliant technologist, a gifted mage, or somewhere in between.</p>

<p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An isometric RPG with sandbox elements: Emphasis on non-linear quests and branching dialogue.</li>
  <li>Steampunk meets High Fantasy: Firearms, locomotive trains, and intricate clockwork gadgets coexist with magical spells and mythical creatures.</li>
  <li>Complex skill &amp; alignment system: The storyline, factions, and NPCs react dynamically to your choices and reputations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="graphics--sound">Graphics &amp; Sound</h2>

<p><em>Arcanum’s</em> 2D/3D hybrid engine shows its age but retains a unique charm. The old-world aesthetic of Victorian streets and archaic labs complements the fantasy vibes.</p>

<p><strong>Audio</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A haunting string-based soundtrack that shifts between melancholic and whimsical.</li>
  <li>Memorable voice acting for key NPCs, though not fully voiced.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gameplay--rpg-mechanics">Gameplay &amp; RPG Mechanics</h2>

<h3 id="character-development">Character Development</h3>

<h3 id="magic-vs-technology">Magic vs. Technology</h3>

<p>The game’s core tension: technology disrupts magical fields, while magic can jam mechanical devices. Your chosen path influences quest solutions, equipment use, and faction relationships.</p>

<h3 id="exploration--choice">Exploration &amp; Choice</h3>

<p>Open-world travel with numerous towns, dungeons, and hidden side quests. Your moral and ethical decisions drastically change how characters perceive you, unlocking or blocking certain storylines.</p>

<h2 id="performance--patches">Performance &amp; Patches</h2>
