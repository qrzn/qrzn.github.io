<p><em>Pharaoh &amp; Cleopatra</em> transports you to the banks of the Nile, where constructing grand pyramids and monuments is just one facet of ruling ancient Egypt. Released in 1998 (with the <em>Cleopatra</em> expansion soon after), this entry refined the classic city-building formula while adding a flavorful dose of Egyptian culture.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Spanning multiple dynasties, you’ll oversee the rise of your city from a humble settlement to a thriving metropolis. You must manage flood cycles, crops, temples, and even ward off the occasional tomb robbers or invading tribes.</p>

<p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Monumental construction: Build pyramids, temples, and the Sphinx to honor the gods and cement your legacy.</li>
  <li>Annual Nile flooding mechanic: Time your farming to coincide with inundation cycles for maximum harvest.</li>
  <li>Expansion content (Cleopatra): Adds more missions, a new storyline, and an emphasis on royal intrigue and advanced monuments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="graphics--sound">Graphics &amp; Sound</h2>

<p>Though 2D, the game’s art style is detailed and immersive. Desert landscapes, bustling bazaars, and well-animated workers bring life to your Egyptian city. The accompanying soundtrack features evocative Middle Eastern-inspired tunes.</p>

<p><strong>Audio</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ambient market sounds and chatter spice up the city vibe.</li>
  <li>Distinct sound cues for everything from dispatching workers to worship services.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deities--worship">Deities &amp; Worship</h3>

<p>Gods like Ra, Osiris, and Bast have different domain influences. Neglect a deity and face plagues or crop failures; appease them with temples, festivals, and offerings for city-wide benefits.</p>

<h3 id="military--diplomacy">Military &amp; Diplomacy</h3>

<p>While predominantly a peaceful builder, the campaign features occasional invasions and rebellious uprisings. Maintaining fortifications and training archers or chariots can be vital.</p>
