    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my digital presence. My name is <strong>J.G. Landje</strong>, and this website serves as a curated collection of my intellectual and creative pursuits. Here, you will find explorations spanning a range of disciplines, from literary analysis to software development, reflecting a commitment to both theoretical inquiry and practical application.</p>

<p>The <a href="/essays"><strong>Essays</strong></a> section contains my written contemplations on diverse topics, the specifics of which are detailed within that section. These writings represent an ongoing engagement with various fields of thought and analysis.</p>

<p>The <a href="/books"><strong>Epubs</strong></a> section houses a selection of digital publications I have prepared. Currently, this section includes EPUB versions of Richard Wilhelm’s German translations of the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi, offering these foundational texts of Daoism in a convenient digital format. Additionally, you will find some works by Aleister Crowley that have not been previously available in the EPUB format, making these texts more accessible to readers.</p>

<p>My interest in the culinary arts is expressed in the <a href="/recipes"><strong>Recipes</strong></a> section, where I share a collection of recipes that I have found both engaging to prepare and satisfying to enjoy. These recipes reflect a variety of culinary approaches and influences.</p>

<!--
In the [**Coding Projects**](/coding) section, you will find a showcase of my personal software development endeavors. These projects, developed primarily for learning and personal enrichment, include:

- [**CLI Game Launcher (Python):**](/pygames) A command-line application for managing and launching locally installed games.
- [**I Ching Web App (JavaScript):**](/yi) A web-based tool for consulting the I Ching.
- [**Tetris Clone (Python):**](/pytris) A digital implementation of the classic Tetris game.
- [**Metroid Clone (Godot):**](/xenotheria) A 2D platformer inspired by the Metroid series, built using the Godot Engine.
- [**EPUB Reader (Android):**](/alexandriaepub) A native Android application for reading EPUB format ebooks.
-->

<p>My broader intellectual interests encompass computer programming, the rich narratives of mythology – particularly those of ancient Egypt, Greece, and China – the philosophical frameworks of Daoism and the I Ching, and the profound insights found within the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Furthermore, I maintain a dedicated study of occultism, astrology, and the tarot, alongside my appreciation for engaging with the natural world through hiking.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I maintain a long-standing interest in the works of H.P. Lovecraft and the philosophical inquiries of Aleister Crowley. These figures have offered unique perspectives that continue to inform my understanding of narrative and the complexities of human thought.</p>

<p>Thank you for your visit. I hope you find the content presented here to be engaging and informative. Contact information can be found in the dedicated <a href="/contact"><strong>Contact</strong></a> section.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>J.G. Landje, Esq.</p>
